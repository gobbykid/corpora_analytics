 DAVID COPPERFIELD THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE OF DAVID COPPERFIELD THE YOUNGER CHAPTER 1. I AM BORN Whether I shall turn hero life, whether station held anybody else, pages must show. To begin life beginning life, I record I born (as I informed believe) Friday, twelve of the clock night. It remarked clock began strike, I began cry, simultaneously. In consideration day hour birth, declared nurse, sage women neighbourhood taken lively interest several months possibility becoming personally acquainted, first, I destined unlucky life; secondly, I privileged see ghosts spirits; gifts inevitably attaching, believed, unlucky infants either gender, born towards small hours Friday night. I need say nothing here, first head, nothing show better history whether prediction verified falsified result. On second branch question, I remark, unless I ran part inheritance I still baby, I come yet. But I complain kept property; anybody else present enjoyment it, he heartily welcome keep it. I born caul, advertised sale, newspapers, low price fifteen guineas. Whether sea-going people short money time, short faith preferred cork jackets, I do not know; I know is, one solitary bidding, attorney connected bill-broking business, offered two pounds cash, balance sherry, declined guaranteed drowning higher bargain. Consequently advertisement withdrawn dead loss--for sherry, poor dear mother’s sherry market then--and ten years afterwards, caul put raffle part country, fifty members half-a-crown head, winner spend five shillings. I present myself, I remember felt quite uncomfortable confused, part disposed way. The caul won, I recollect, old lady hand-basket, who, reluctantly, produced stipulated five shillings, halfpence, twopence halfpenny short--as took immense time great waste arithmetic, endeavour without effect prove her. It fact long remembered remarkable there, she never drowned, died triumphantly bed, ninety-two. I understood was, last, her proudest boast, she never water her life, except upon bridge; her tea (to she extremely partial) she, last, expressed her indignation impiety mariners others, presumption go ‘meandering’ world. It vain represent her conveniences, tea perhaps included, resulted objectionable practice. She always returned, greater emphasis instinctive knowledge strength her objection, ‘Let us meandering.’ Not meander myself, present, I go back birth. I born Blunderstone, Suffolk, ‘there by’, say Scotland. I posthumous child. My father’s eyes closed upon light world six months, mine opened it. There something strange me, even now, reflection he never saw me; something stranger yet shadowy remembrance I first childish associations his white grave-stone churchyard, indefinable compassion I used feel lying alone dark night, little parlour warm bright fire candle, doors house were--almost cruelly, seemed sometimes--bolted locked it. An aunt father’s, consequently great-aunt mine, I shall relate by, principal magnate family. Miss Trotwood, Miss Betsey, poor mother always called her, she sufficiently overcame her dread formidable personage mention her (which seldom), married husband younger herself, handsome, except sense homely adage, ‘handsome is, handsome does’--for he strongly suspected beaten Miss Betsey, even once, disputed question supplies, made hasty determined arrangements throw her two pair stairs’ window. These evidences incompatibility temper induced Miss Betsey pay off, effect separation mutual consent. He went India his capital, there, according wild legend family, he seen riding elephant, company Baboon; I think must Baboo--or Begum. Anyhow, India tidings his death reached home, within ten years. How affected aunt, nobody knew; immediately upon separation, she took her maiden name again, bought cottage hamlet sea-coast long way off, established herself single woman one servant, understood live secluded, ever afterwards, inflexible retirement. My father favourite hers, I believe; she mortally affronted his marriage, ground mother ‘a wax doll’. She never seen mother, she knew her yet twenty. My father Miss Betsey never met again. He double mother’s age he married, delicate constitution. He died year afterwards, and, I said, six months I came world. This state matters, afternoon of, I may excused calling, eventful important Friday. I make claim therefore known, time, matters stood; remembrance, founded evidence senses, follows. My mother sitting fire, poorly health, low spirits, looking her tears, desponding heavily herself fatherless little stranger, already welcomed grosses prophetic pins, drawer upstairs, world excited subject his arrival; mother, I say, sitting fire, bright, windy March afternoon, timid sad, doubtful ever coming alive trial her, when, lifting her eyes she dried them, window opposite, she saw strange lady coming garden. My mother sure foreboding second glance, Miss Betsey. The setting sun glowing strange lady, garden-fence, she came walking door fell rigidity figure composure countenance could belonged nobody else. When she reached house, she gave another proof her identity. My father often hinted she seldom conducted herself like ordinary Christian; now, instead ringing bell, she came looked identical window, pressing end her nose glass extent, poor dear mother used say became perfectly flat white moment. She gave mother turn, I always convinced I indebted Miss Betsey born Friday. My mother left her chair her agitation, gone behind corner. Miss Betsey, looking round room, slowly inquiringly, began side, carried her eyes on, like Saracen’s Head Dutch clock, reached mother. Then she made frown gesture mother, like one accustomed obeyed, come open door. My mother went. ‘Mrs. David Copperfield, I think,’ said Miss Betsey; emphasis referring, perhaps, mother’s mourning weeds, her condition. ‘Yes,’ said mother, faintly. ‘Miss Trotwood,’ said visitor. ‘You heard her, I dare say?’ My mother answered she pleasure. And she disagreeable consciousness appearing imply overpowering pleasure. ‘Now see her,’ said Miss Betsey. My mother bent her head, begged her walk in. They went parlour mother come from, fire best room side passage lighted--not lighted, indeed, since father’s funeral; seated, Miss Betsey said nothing, mother, vainly trying restrain herself, began cry. ‘Oh tut, tut, tut!’ said Miss Betsey, hurry. ‘Do not that! Come, come!’ My mother could not help notwithstanding, she cried she her cry out. ‘Take cap, child,’ said Miss Betsey, ‘and let see you.’ My mother much afraid her refuse compliance odd request, she disposition so. Therefore she she told, nervous hands her hair (which luxuriant beautiful) fell her face. ‘Why, bless heart!’ exclaimed Miss Betsey. ‘You Baby!’ My mother was, doubt, unusually youthful appearance even her years; she hung her head, her fault, poor thing, said, sobbing, indeed she afraid she childish widow, would childish mother she lived. In short pause ensued, she fancy she felt Miss Betsey touch her hair, ungentle hand; but, looking her, her timid hope, she found lady sitting skirt her dress tucked up, her hands folded one knee, her feet upon fender, frowning fire. ‘In name Heaven,’ said Miss Betsey, suddenly, ‘why Rookery?’ ‘Do mean house, madam?’ asked mother. ‘Why Rookery?’ said Miss Betsey. ‘Cookery would purpose, practical ideas life, either you.’ ‘The name Mr. Copperfield’s choice,’ returned mother. ‘When he bought house, he liked think rooks it.’ The evening wind made disturbance now, among tall old elm-trees bottom garden, neither mother Miss Betsey could forbear glancing way. As elms bent one another, like giants whispering secrets, seconds repose, fell violent flurry, tossing wild arms about, late confidences really wicked peace mind, weatherbeaten ragged old rooks’-nests, burdening higher branches, swung like wrecks upon stormy sea. ‘Where birds?’ asked Miss Betsey. ‘The--?’ My mother thinking something else. ‘The rooks--what become them?’ asked Miss Betsey. ‘There since lived here,’ said mother. ‘We thought--Mr. Copperfield thought--it quite large rookery; nests old ones, birds deserted long while.’ ‘David Copperfield over!’ cried Miss Betsey. ‘David Copperfield head foot! Calls house rookery there is rook near it, takes birds trust, he sees nests!’ ‘Mr. Copperfield,’ returned mother, ‘is dead, dare speak unkindly me--’ My poor dear mother, I suppose, momentary intention committing assault battery upon aunt, could easily settled her one hand, even mother far better training encounter she evening. But passed action rising her chair; she sat meekly, fainted. When she came herself, Miss Betsey restored her, whichever was, she found latter standing window. The twilight time shading darkness; dimly saw other, could done without aid fire. ‘Well?’ said Miss Betsey, coming back her chair, she taking casual look prospect; ‘and expect--’ ‘I tremble,’ faltered mother. ‘I do not know what is matter. I shall die, I sure!’ ‘No, no, no,’ said Miss Betsey. ‘Have tea.’ ‘Oh dear me, dear me, think good?’ cried mother helpless manner. ‘Of course will,’ said Miss Betsey. ‘It is nothing fancy. What call girl?’ ‘I do not know girl, yet, madam,’ said mother innocently. ‘Bless Baby!’ exclaimed Miss Betsey, unconsciously quoting second sentiment pincushion drawer upstairs, applying mother instead me, ‘I do not mean that. I mean servant-girl.’ ‘Peggotty,’ said mother. ‘Peggotty!’ repeated Miss Betsey, indignation. ‘Do mean say, child, human gone Christian church, got herself named Peggotty?’ ‘It is her surname,’ said mother, faintly. ‘Mr. Copperfield called her it, her Christian name mine.’ ‘Here! Peggotty!’ cried Miss Betsey, opening parlour door. ‘Tea. Your mistress little unwell. Do not dawdle.’ Having issued mandate much potentiality she recognized authority house ever since house, looked confront amazed Peggotty coming along passage candle sound strange voice, Miss Betsey shut door again, sat before: her feet fender, skirt her dress tucked up, her hands folded one knee. ‘You speaking girl,’ said Miss Betsey. ‘I doubt girl. I presentiment must girl. Now child, moment birth girl--’ ‘Perhaps boy,’ mother took liberty putting in. ‘I tell I presentiment must girl,’ returned Miss Betsey. ‘Do not contradict. From moment girl’s birth, child, I intend her friend. I intend her godmother, I beg you will call her Betsey Trotwood Copperfield. There must mistakes life THIS Betsey Trotwood. There must trifling HER affections, poor dear. She must well brought up, well guarded reposing foolish confidences deserved. I must make MY care.’ There twitch Miss Betsey’s head, sentences, her old wrongs working within her, she repressed plainer reference strong constraint. So mother suspected, least, she observed her low glimmer fire: much scared Miss Betsey, uneasy herself, subdued bewildered altogether, observe anything clearly, know say. ‘And David good you, child?’ asked Miss Betsey, she silent little while, motions her head gradually ceased. ‘Were comfortable together?’ ‘We happy,’ said mother. ‘Mr. Copperfield good me.’ ‘What, he spoilt you, I suppose?’ returned Miss Betsey. ‘For quite alone dependent rough world again, yes, I fear he indeed,’ sobbed mother. ‘Well! Do not cry!’ said Miss Betsey. ‘You equally matched, child--if two people equally matched--and I asked question. You orphan, were not you?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘And governess?’ ‘I nursery-governess family Mr. Copperfield came visit. Mr. Copperfield kind me, took great deal notice me, paid good deal attention, last proposed me. And I accepted him. And married,’ said mother simply. ‘Ha! Poor Baby!’ mused Miss Betsey, her frown still bent upon fire. ‘Do know anything?’ ‘I beg pardon, madam,’ faltered mother. ‘About keeping house, instance,’ said Miss Betsey. ‘Not much, I fear,’ returned mother. ‘Not much I could wish. But Mr. Copperfield teaching me--’ [‘Much he knew himself!’) said Miss Betsey parenthesis. --‘And I hope I improved, anxious learn, he patient teach me, great misfortune his death’--my mother broke here, could get farther. ‘Well, well!’ said Miss Betsey. --‘I kept housekeeping-book regularly, balanced Mr. Copperfield every night,’ cried mother another burst distress, breaking again. ‘Well, well!’ said Miss Betsey. ‘Do not cry more.’ --‘And I sure never word difference respecting it, except Mr. Copperfield objected threes fives much like other, putting curly tails sevens nines,’ resumed mother another burst, breaking again. ‘You will make ill,’ said Miss Betsey, ‘and know good either god-daughter. Come! You must not it!’ This argument share quieting mother, though her increasing indisposition larger one. There interval silence, broken Miss Betsey’s occasionally ejaculating ‘Ha!’ she sat her feet upon fender. ‘David bought annuity his money, I know,’ said she, by. ‘What he you?’ ‘Mr. Copperfield,’ said mother, answering difficulty, ‘was considerate good secure reversion part me.’ ‘How much?’ asked Miss Betsey. ‘A hundred five pounds year,’ said mother. ‘He might done worse,’ said aunt. The word appropriate moment. My mother much worse Peggotty, coming teaboard candles, seeing glance ill she was,--as Miss Betsey might done sooner light enough,--conveyed her upstairs her room speed; immediately dispatched Ham Peggotty, her nephew, days past secreted house, unknown mother, special messenger case emergency, fetch nurse doctor. Those allied powers considerably astonished, arrived within minutes other, find unknown lady portentous appearance, sitting fire, her bonnet tied her left arm, stopping her ears jewellers’ cotton. Peggotty knowing nothing her, mother saying nothing her, she quite mystery parlour; fact her magazine jewellers’ cotton her pocket, sticking article her ears way, detract solemnity her presence. The doctor upstairs come again, satisfied himself, I suppose, probability unknown lady sit there, face face, hours, laid polite social. He meekest his sex, mildest little men. He sidled room, take less space. He walked softly Ghost Hamlet, slowly. He carried his head one side, partly modest depreciation himself, partly modest propitiation everybody else. It nothing say he had not word throw dog. He could not thrown word mad dog. He might offered one gently, half one, fragment one; he spoke slowly he walked; he would not rude him, he could not quick him, earthly consideration. Mr. Chillip, looking mildly aunt his head one side, making her little bow, said, allusion jewellers’ cotton, he softly touched his left ear: ‘Some local irritation, madam?’ ‘What!’ replied aunt, pulling cotton one ear like cork. Mr. Chillip alarmed her abruptness--as he told mother afterwards--that mercy he did not lose his presence mind. But he repeated sweetly: ‘Some local irritation, madam?’ ‘Nonsense!’ replied aunt, corked herself again, one blow. Mr. Chillip could nothing this, sit look her feebly, she sat looked fire, he called upstairs again. After quarter hour’s absence, he returned. ‘Well?’ said aunt, taking cotton ear nearest him. ‘Well, madam,’ returned Mr. Chillip, ‘we are--we progressing slowly, madam.’ ‘Ba--a--ah!’ said aunt, perfect shake contemptuous interjection. And corked herself before. Really--really--as Mr. Chillip told mother, he almost shocked; speaking professional point view alone, he almost shocked. But he sat looked her, notwithstanding, nearly two hours, she sat looking fire, he called out. After another absence, he returned. ‘Well?’ said aunt, taking cotton side again. ‘Well, madam,’ returned Mr. Chillip, ‘we are--we progressing slowly, madam.’ ‘Ya--a--ah!’ said aunt. With snarl him, Mr. Chillip absolutely could bear it. It really calculated break his spirit, he said afterwards. He preferred go sit upon stairs, dark strong draught, he sent for. Ham Peggotty, went national school, dragon his catechism, may therefore regarded credible witness, reported next day, happening peep parlour-door hour this, he instantly descried Miss Betsey, walking fro state agitation, pounced upon he could make his escape. That occasional sounds feet voices overhead he inferred cotton exclude, circumstance his evidently clutched lady victim expend her superabundant agitation sounds loudest. That, marching constantly collar (as he taking much laudanum), she, times, shook him, rumpled his hair, made light his linen, stopped his ears she confounded her own, otherwise tousled maltreated him. This part confirmed his aunt, saw half past twelve of the clock, soon his release, affirmed he red I was. The mild Mr. Chillip could possibly bear malice time, time. He sidled parlour soon he liberty, said aunt his meekest manner: ‘Well, madam, I happy congratulate you.’ ‘What upon?’ said aunt, sharply. Mr. Chillip fluttered again, extreme severity aunt’s manner; he made her little bow gave her little smile, mollify her. ‘Mercy man, what is he doing!’ cried aunt, impatiently. ‘Cannot he speak?’ ‘Be calm, dear madam,’ said Mr. Chillip, his softest accents. ‘There longer occasion uneasiness, madam. Be calm.’ It since considered almost miracle aunt did not shake him, shake he say, him. She shook her head him, way made quail. ‘Well, madam,’ resumed Mr. Chillip, soon he courage, ‘I happy congratulate you. All over, madam, well over.’ During five minutes Mr. Chillip devoted delivery oration, aunt eyed narrowly. ‘How she?’ said aunt, folding her arms her bonnet still tied one them. ‘Well, madam, she soon quite comfortable, I hope,’ returned Mr. Chillip. ‘Quite comfortable expect young mother be, melancholy domestic circumstances. There cannot objection seeing her presently, madam. It may her good.’ ‘And SHE. How SHE?’ said aunt, sharply. Mr. Chillip laid his head little one side, looked aunt like amiable bird. ‘The baby,’ said aunt. ‘How she?’ ‘Madam,’ returned Mr. Chillip, ‘I apprehended known. It is boy.’ My aunt said never word, took her bonnet strings, manner sling, aimed blow Mr. Chillip’s head it, put bent, walked out, never came back. She vanished like discontented fairy; like one supernatural beings, popularly supposed I entitled see; never came back more. No. I lay basket, mother lay her bed; Betsey Trotwood Copperfield ever land dreams shadows, tremendous region whence I lately travelled; light upon window room shone upon earthly bourne travellers, mound ashes dust he, without I never been. CHAPTER 2. I OBSERVE The first objects assume distinct presence me, I look far back, blank infancy, mother her pretty hair youthful shape, Peggotty shape all, eyes dark seemed darken whole neighbourhood her face, cheeks arms hard red I wondered birds did not peck her preference apples. I believe I remember two little distance apart, dwarfed sight stooping kneeling floor, I going unsteadily one other. I impression mind I cannot distinguish actual remembrance, touch Peggotty’s forefinger she used hold me, roughened needlework, like pocket nutmeg-grater. This may fancy, though I think memory us go farther back times many us suppose; I believe power observation numbers young children quite wonderful closeness accuracy. Indeed, I think grown men remarkable respect, may greater propriety said lost faculty, acquired it; rather, I generally observe men retain certain freshness, gentleness, capacity pleased, also inheritance preserved childhood. I might misgiving I ‘meandering’ stopping say this, brings remark I build conclusions, part upon experience myself; appear anything I may set narrative I child close observation, man I strong memory childhood, I undoubtedly lay claim characteristics. Looking back, I saying, blank infancy, first objects I remember standing confusion things, mother Peggotty. What else I remember? Let see. There comes cloud, house--not new me, quite familiar, earliest remembrance. On ground-floor Peggotty’s kitchen, opening back yard; pigeon-house pole, centre, without pigeons it; great dog-kennel corner, without dog; quantity fowls look terribly tall me, walking about, menacing ferocious manner. There one cock gets upon post crow, seems take particular notice I look kitchen window, makes shiver, he fierce. Of geese outside side-gate come waddling long necks stretched I go way, I dream night: man environed wild beasts might dream lions. Here long passage--what enormous perspective I make it!--leading Peggotty’s kitchen front door. A dark store-room opens it, place run past night; I do not know may among tubs jars old tea-chests, nobody dimly-burning light, letting mouldy air come door, smell soap, pickles, pepper, candles, coffee, one whiff. Then two parlours: parlour sit evening, mother I Peggotty--for Peggotty quite companion, her work done alone--and best parlour sit Sunday; grandly, comfortably. There something doleful air room me, Peggotty told me--I do not know when, apparently ages ago--about father’s funeral, company black cloaks put on. One Sunday night mother reads Peggotty there, Lazarus raised dead. And I frightened afterwards obliged take bed, show quiet churchyard bedroom window, dead lying graves rest, solemn moon. There nothing half green I know anywhere, grass churchyard; nothing half shady trees; nothing half quiet tombstones. The sheep feeding there, I kneel up, early morning, little bed closet within mother’s room, look it; I see red light shining sun-dial, think within myself, ‘Is sun-dial glad, I wonder, tell time again?’ Here pew church. What high-backed pew! With window near it, house seen, IS seen many times morning’s service, Peggotty, likes make herself sure she it is robbed, flames. But though Peggotty’s eye wanders, she much offended mine does, frowns me, I stand upon seat, I look clergyman. But I cannot always look him--I know without white thing on, I afraid his wondering I stare so, perhaps stopping service inquire--and I do? It is dreadful thing gape, I must something. I look mother, she pretends see me. I look boy aisle, he makes faces me. I look sunlight coming open door porch, I see stray sheep--I do not mean sinner, mutton--half making his mind come church. I feel I looked longer, I might tempted say something loud; would become then! I look monumental tablets wall, try think Mr. Bodgers late parish, feelings Mrs. Bodgers must been, affliction sore, long time Mr. Bodgers bore, physicians vain. I wonder whether called Mr. Chillip, he vain; so, he likes reminded week. I look Mr. Chillip, his Sunday neckcloth, pulpit; think good place would play in, castle would make, another boy coming stairs attack it, velvet cushion tassels thrown his head. In time eyes gradually shut up; and, seeming hear clergyman singing drowsy song heat, I hear nothing, I fall seat crash, taken out, dead alive, Peggotty. And I see outside house, latticed bedroom-windows standing open let sweet-smelling air, ragged old rooks’-nests still dangling elm-trees bottom front garden. Now I garden back, beyond yard empty pigeon-house dog-kennel are--a preserve butterflies, I remember it, high fence, gate padlock; fruit clusters trees, riper richer fruit ever since, garden, mother gathers basket, I stand by, bolting furtive gooseberries, trying look unmoved. A great wind rises, summer gone moment. We playing winter twilight, dancing parlour. When mother breath rests herself elbow-chair, I watch her winding her bright curls round her fingers, straitening her waist, nobody knows better I she likes look well, proud pretty. That among earliest impressions. That, sense little afraid Peggotty, submitted things her direction, among first opinions--if may called--that I ever derived I saw. Peggotty I sitting one night parlour fire, alone. I reading Peggotty crocodiles. I must read perspicuously, poor soul must deeply interested, I remember she cloudy impression, I done, sort vegetable. I tired reading, dead sleepy; leave, high treat, sit mother came home spending evening neighbour’s, I would rather died upon post (of course) gone bed. I reached stage sleepiness Peggotty seemed swell grow immensely large. I propped eyelids open two forefingers, looked perseveringly her she sat work; little bit wax-candle she kept her thread--how old looked, wrinkled directions!--at little house thatched roof, yard-measure lived; her work-box sliding lid, view St. Paul’s Cathedral (with pink dome) painted top; brass thimble her finger; herself, I thought lovely. I felt sleepy, I knew I lost sight anything moment, I gone. ‘Peggotty,’ says I, suddenly, ‘were ever married?’ ‘Lord, Master Davy,’ replied Peggotty. ‘What is put marriage head?’ She answered start, quite awoke me. And she stopped her work, looked me, her needle drawn thread’s length. ‘But WERE ever married, Peggotty?’ says I. ‘You handsome woman, an’t you?’ I thought her different style mother, certainly; another school beauty, I considered her perfect example. There red velvet footstool best parlour, mother painted nosegay. The ground-work stool, Peggotty’s complexion appeared one thing. The stool smooth, Peggotty rough, made difference. ‘Me handsome, Davy!’ said Peggotty. ‘Lawk, no, dear! But put marriage head?’ ‘I do not know!--You must not marry one person time, may you, Peggotty?’ ‘Certainly not,’ says Peggotty, promptest decision. ‘But marry person, person dies, may marry another person, may not you, Peggotty?’ ‘YOU MAY,’ says Peggotty, ‘if choose, dear. That is matter opinion.’ ‘But opinion, Peggotty?’ said I. I asked her, looked curiously her, she looked curiously me. ‘My opinion is,’ said Peggotty, taking her eyes me, little indecision going her work, ‘that I never married myself, Master Davy, I do not expect be. That is I know subject.’ ‘You an’t cross, I suppose, Peggotty, you?’ said I, sitting quiet minute. I really thought she was, she short me; I quite mistaken: she laid aside her work (which stocking her own), opening her arms wide, took curly head within them, gave good squeeze. I know good squeeze, because, plump, whenever she made little exertion she dressed, buttons back her gown flew off. And I recollect two bursting opposite side parlour, she hugging me. ‘Now let hear Crorkindills,’ said Peggotty, quite right name yet, ‘for I an’t heard half enough.’ I could not quite understand Peggotty looked queer, she ready go back crocodiles. However, returned monsters, fresh wakefulness part, left eggs sand sun hatch; ran away them, baffled constantly turning, unable quickly, account unwieldy make; went water them, natives, put sharp pieces timber throats; short ran whole crocodile gauntlet. I did, least; I doubts Peggotty, thoughtfully sticking her needle various parts her face arms, time. We exhausted crocodiles, begun alligators, garden-bell rang. We went door; mother, looking unusually pretty, I thought, her gentleman beautiful black hair whiskers, walked home us church last Sunday. As mother stooped threshold take her arms kiss me, gentleman said I highly privileged little fellow monarch--or something like that; later understanding comes, I sensible, aid here. ‘What mean?’ I asked him, her shoulder. He patted head; somehow, I did not like his deep voice, I jealous his hand touch mother’s touching me--which did. I put away, well I could. ‘Oh, Davy!’ remonstrated mother. ‘Dear boy!’ said gentleman. ‘I cannot wonder his devotion!’ I never saw beautiful colour mother’s face before. She gently chid rude; and, keeping close her shawl, turned thank gentleman taking much trouble bring her home. She put her hand she spoke, and, he met his own, she glanced, I thought, me. ‘Let us say “good night”, fine boy,’ said gentleman, he bent his head--I saw him!--over mother’s little glove. ‘Good night!’ said I. ‘Come! Let us best friends world!’ said gentleman, laughing. ‘Shake hands!’ My right hand mother’s left, I gave other. ‘Why, that is Wrong hand, Davy!’ laughed gentleman. My mother drew right hand forward, I resolved, former reason, give him, I not. I gave other, he shook heartily, said I brave fellow, went away. At minute I see turn round garden, give us last look his ill-omened black eyes, door shut. Peggotty, said word moved finger, secured fastenings instantly, went parlour. My mother, contrary her usual habit, instead coming elbow-chair fire, remained end room, sat singing herself. --‘Hope pleasant evening, madam,’ said Peggotty, standing stiff barrel centre room, candlestick her hand. ‘Much obliged you, Peggotty,’ returned mother, cheerful voice, ‘I VERY pleasant evening.’ ‘A stranger makes agreeable change,’ suggested Peggotty. ‘A agreeable change, indeed,’ returned mother. Peggotty continuing stand motionless middle room, mother resuming her singing, I fell asleep, though I sound asleep I could hear voices, without hearing said. When I half awoke uncomfortable doze, I found Peggotty mother tears, talking. ‘Not one this, Mr. Copperfield would not liked,’ said Peggotty. ‘That I say, I swear!’ ‘Good Heavens!’ cried mother, ‘you will drive mad! Was ever poor girl ill-used her servants I am! Why I injustice calling girl? Have I never married, Peggotty?’ ‘God knows have, madam,’ returned Peggotty. ‘Then, dare,’ said mother--‘you know I do not mean dare, Peggotty, heart--to make uncomfortable say bitter things me, well aware I have not, place, single friend turn to?’ ‘The more’s reason,’ returned Peggotty, ‘for saying will not do. No! That will not do. No! No price could make do. No!’--I thought Peggotty would thrown candlestick away, she emphatic it. ‘How aggravating,’ said mother, shedding tears before, ‘as talk unjust manner! How go settled arranged, Peggotty, I tell again, cruel thing, beyond commonest civilities nothing passed! You talk admiration. What I do? If people silly indulge sentiment, fault? What I do, I ask you? Would wish shave head black face, disfigure burn, scald, something sort? I dare say would, Peggotty. I dare say you would quite enjoy it.’ Peggotty seemed take aspersion much heart, I thought. ‘And dear boy,’ cried mother, coming elbow-chair I was, caressing me, ‘my little Davy! Is hinted I wanting affection precious treasure, dearest little fellow ever was!’ ‘Nobody never went hinted thing,’ said Peggotty. ‘You did, Peggotty!’ returned mother. ‘You know did. What else possible infer said, unkind creature, know well I do, his account last quarter I would not buy new parasol, though old green one frayed whole way up, fringe perfectly mangy? You know is, Peggotty. You cannot deny it.’ Then, turning affectionately me, her cheek mine, ‘Am I naughty mama you, Davy? Am I nasty, cruel, selfish, bad mama? Say I am, child; say “yes”, dear boy, Peggotty love you; Peggotty’s love great deal better mine, Davy. I do not love all, I?’ At this, fell a-crying together. I think I loudest party, I sure sincere it. I quite heart-broken myself, afraid first transports wounded tenderness I called Peggotty ‘Beast’. That honest creature deep affliction, I remember, must become quite buttonless occasion; little volley explosives went off, when, made mother, she kneeled elbow-chair, made me. We went bed greatly dejected. My sobs kept waking me, long time; one strong sob quite hoisted bed, I found mother sitting coverlet, leaning me. I fell asleep her arms, that, slept soundly. Whether following Sunday I saw gentleman again, whether greater lapse time he reappeared, I cannot recall. I do not profess clear dates. But he was, church, he walked home us afterwards. He came in, too, look famous geranium had, parlour-window. It appear he took much notice it, he went he asked mother give bit blossom. She begged choose himself, he refused that--I could understand why--so she plucked him, gave his hand. He said he would never, never part more; I thought he must quite fool know would fall pieces day two. Peggotty began less us, evening, she always been. My mother deferred her much--more usual, occurred me--and three excellent friends; still different used be, comfortable among ourselves. Sometimes I fancied Peggotty perhaps objected mother’s wearing pretty dresses she her drawers, her going often visit neighbour’s; I could not, satisfaction, make was. Gradually, I became used seeing gentleman black whiskers. I liked better first, uneasy jealousy him; I reason beyond child’s instinctive dislike, general idea Peggotty I could make much mother without help, certainly THE reason I might found I older. No thing came mind, near it. I could observe, little pieces, were; making net number pieces, catching anybody it, was, yet, beyond me. One autumn morning I mother front garden, Mr. Murdstone--I knew name now--came by, horseback. He reined his horse salute mother, said he going Lowestoft see friends yacht, merrily proposed take saddle I would like ride. The air clear pleasant, horse seemed like idea ride much himself, he stood snorting pawing garden-gate, I great desire go. So I sent upstairs Peggotty made spruce; meantime Mr. Murdstone dismounted, and, his horse’s bridle drawn his arm, walked slowly outer side sweetbriar fence, mother walked slowly inner keep company. I recollect Peggotty I peeping little window; I recollect closely seemed examining sweetbriar them, strolled along; how, perfectly angelic temper, Peggotty turned cross moment, brushed hair wrong way, excessively hard. Mr. Murdstone I soon off, trotting along green turf side road. He held quite easily one arm, I do not think I restless usually; I could make mind sit front without turning head sometimes, looking his face. He kind shallow black eye--I want better word express eye depth looked into--which, abstracted, seems peculiarity light disfigured, moment time, cast. Several times I glanced him, I observed appearance sort awe, wondered he thinking closely. His hair whiskers blacker thicker, looked near, even I given credit being. A squareness lower part his face, dotted indication strong black beard he shaved close every day, reminded wax-work travelled neighbourhood half-a-year before. This, his regular eyebrows, rich white, black, brown, his complexion--confound his complexion, his memory!--made think him, spite misgivings, handsome man. I doubt poor dear mother thought too. We went hotel sea, two gentlemen smoking cigars room themselves. Each lying least four chairs, large rough jacket on. In corner heap coats boat-cloaks, flag, bundled together. They rolled feet untidy sort manner, came in, said, ‘Halloa, Murdstone! We thought dead!’ ‘Not yet,’ said Mr. Murdstone. ‘And who is shaver?’ said one gentlemen, taking hold me. ‘That is Davy,’ returned Mr. Murdstone. ‘Davy who?’ said gentleman. ‘Jones?’ ‘Copperfield,’ said Mr. Murdstone. ‘What! Bewitching Mrs. Copperfield’s encumbrance?’ cried gentleman. ‘The pretty little widow?’ ‘Quinion,’ said Mr. Murdstone, ‘take care, please. Somebody is sharp.’ ‘Who is?’ asked gentleman, laughing. I looked up, quickly; curious know. ‘Only Brooks Sheffield,’ said Mr. Murdstone. I quite relieved find Brooks Sheffield; for, first, I really thought I. There seemed something comical reputation Mr. Brooks Sheffield, gentlemen laughed heartily he mentioned, Mr. Murdstone good deal amused also. After laughing, gentleman he called Quinion, said: ‘And opinion Brooks Sheffield, reference projected business?’ ‘Why, I do not know Brooks understands much present,’ replied Mr. Murdstone; ‘but he generally favourable, I believe.’ There laughter this, Mr. Quinion said he would ring bell sherry drink Brooks. This he did; wine came, he made little, biscuit, and, I drank it, stand say, ‘Confusion Brooks Sheffield!’ The toast received great applause, hearty laughter made laugh too; laughed more. In short, quite enjoyed ourselves. We walked cliff that, sat grass, looked things telescope--I could make nothing put eye, I pretended I could--and came back hotel early dinner. All time out, two gentlemen smoked incessantly--which, I thought, I might judge smell rough coats, must doing, ever since coats first come home tailor’s. I must forget went board yacht, three descended cabin, busy papers. I saw quite hard work, I looked open skylight. They left me, time, nice man large head red hair small shiny hat upon it, got cross-barred shirt waistcoat on, ‘Skylark’ capital letters across chest. I thought his name; he lived board ship had not street door put his name on, he put instead; I called Mr. Skylark, he said meant vessel. I observed day Mr. Murdstone graver steadier two gentlemen. They gay careless. They joked freely one another, seldom him. It appeared he clever cold were, regarded something feeling. I remarked that, twice Mr. Quinion talking, he looked Mr. Murdstone sideways, make sure his displeased; Mr. Passnidge (the gentleman) high spirits, he trod upon his foot, gave secret caution his eyes, observe Mr. Murdstone, sitting stern silent. Nor I recollect Mr. Murdstone laughed day, except Sheffield joke--and that, by, his own. We went home early evening. It fine evening, mother he another stroll sweetbriar, I sent get tea. When he gone, mother asked day I had, said done. I mentioned said her, she laughed, told impudent fellows talked nonsense--but I knew pleased her. I knew quite well I know now. I took opportunity asking she acquainted Mr. Brooks Sheffield, she answered No, she supposed he must manufacturer knife fork way. Can I say her face--altered I reason remember it, perished I know is--that gone, comes instant, distinct face I may choose look crowded street? Can I say her innocent girlish beauty, faded, more, breath falls cheek now, fell night? Can I say she ever changed, remembrance brings her back life, thus only; and, truer loving youth I been, man ever is, still holds fast cherished then? I write her she I gone bed talk, she came bid good night. She kneeled playfully side bed, laying her chin upon her hands, laughing, said: ‘What said, Davy? Tell again. I cannot believe it.’ ‘“Bewitching--“’ I began. My mother put her hands upon lips stop me. ‘It never bewitching,’ she said, laughing. ‘It never could bewitching, Davy. Now I know was not!’ ‘Yes, was. “Bewitching Mrs. Copperfield”,’ I repeated stoutly. ‘And, “pretty.”’ ‘No, no, never pretty. Not pretty,’ interposed mother, laying her fingers lips again. ‘Yes was. “Pretty little widow.”’ ‘What foolish, impudent creatures!’ cried mother, laughing covering her face. ‘What ridiculous men! An’t they? Davy dear--’ ‘Well, Ma.’ ‘Do not tell Peggotty; she might angry them. I dreadfully angry myself; I would rather Peggotty did not know.’ I promised, course; kissed one another again, I soon fell fast asleep. It seems me, distance time, next day Peggotty broached striking adventurous proposition I mention; probably two months afterwards. We sitting before, one evening (when mother before), company stocking yard-measure, bit wax, box St. Paul’s lid, crocodile book, Peggotty, looking several times, opening her mouth she going speak, without it--which I thought merely gaping, I rather alarmed--said coaxingly: ‘Master Davy, like go along spend fortnight brother’s Yarmouth? Would not treat?’ ‘Is brother agreeable man, Peggotty?’ I inquired, provisionally. ‘Oh, agreeable man he is!’ cried Peggotty, holding her hands. ‘Then there is sea; boats ships; fishermen; beach; Am play with--’ Peggotty meant her nephew Ham, mentioned first chapter; she spoke morsel English Grammar. I flushed her summary delights, replied would indeed treat, would mother say? ‘Why I will good bet guinea,’ said Peggotty, intent upon face, ‘that she will let us go. I will ask her, like, soon ever she comes home. There now!’ ‘But what is she we are away?’ said I, putting small elbows table argue point. ‘She cannot live herself.’ If Peggotty looking hole, sudden, heel stocking, must little one indeed, worth darning. ‘I say! Peggotty! She cannot live herself, know.’ ‘Oh, bless you!’ said Peggotty, looking last. ‘Do not know? She is going stay fortnight Mrs. Grayper. Mrs. Grayper’s going lot company.’ Oh! If it, I quite ready go. I waited, utmost impatience, mother came home Mrs. Grayper’s (for identical neighbour), ascertain could get leave carry great idea. Without nearly much surprised I expected, mother entered readily; arranged night, board lodging visit paid for. The day soon came going. It early day came soon, even me, fever expectation, half afraid earthquake fiery mountain, great convulsion nature, might interpose stop expedition. We go carrier’s cart, departed morning breakfast. I would given money allowed wrap over-night, sleep hat boots. It touches nearly now, although I tell lightly, recollect eager I leave happy home; think little I suspected I leave ever. I glad recollect carrier’s cart gate, mother stood kissing me, grateful fondness her old place I never turned back upon before, made cry. I glad know mother cried too, I felt her heart beat mine. I glad recollect carrier began move, mother ran gate, called stop, she might kiss more. I glad dwell upon earnestness love she lifted her face mine, so. As left her standing road, Mr. Murdstone came she was, seemed expostulate her moved. I looking back round awning cart, wondered business his. Peggotty, also looking back side, seemed anything satisfied; face she brought back cart denoted. I sat looking Peggotty time, reverie supposititious case: whether, she employed lose like boy fairy tale, I able track way home buttons she would she would. CHAPTER 3. I HAVE A CHANGE The carrier’s horse laziest horse world, I hope, shuffled along, his head down, he liked keep people waiting packages directed. I fancied, indeed, he sometimes chuckled audibly reflection, carrier said he troubled cough. The carrier way keeping his head down, like his horse, drooping sleepily forward he drove, one his arms his knees. I say ‘drove’, struck cart would gone Yarmouth quite well without him, horse that; conversation, he idea whistling. Peggotty basket refreshments her knee, would lasted us handsomely, going London conveyance. We ate good deal, slept good deal. Peggotty always went sleep her chin upon handle basket, her hold never relaxed; I could believed unless I heard her it, one defenceless woman could snored much. We made many deviations lanes, long time delivering bedstead public-house, calling places, I quite tired, glad, saw Yarmouth. It looked rather spongy soppy, I thought, I carried eye great dull waste lay across river; I could help wondering, world really round geography book said, part came flat. But I reflected Yarmouth might situated one poles; would account it. As drew little nearer, saw whole adjacent prospect lying straight low line sky, I hinted Peggotty mound might improved it; also land little separated sea, town tide quite much mixed up, like toast water, would nicer. But Peggotty said, greater emphasis usual, must take things found them, that, her part, she proud call herself Yarmouth Bloater. When got street (which strange enough me) smelt fish, pitch, oakum, tar, saw sailors walking about, carts jingling stones, I felt I done busy place injustice; said much Peggotty, heard expressions delight great complacency, told well known (I suppose good fortune born Bloaters) Yarmouth was, upon whole, finest place universe. ‘Here is Am!’ screamed Peggotty, ‘growed knowledge!’ He waiting us, fact, public-house; asked I found myself, like old acquaintance. I feel, first, I knew well he knew me, he never come house since night I born, naturally he advantage me. But intimacy much advanced his taking his back carry home. He was, now, huge, strong fellow six feet high, broad proportion, round-shouldered; simpering boy’s face curly light hair gave quite sheepish look. He dressed canvas jacket, pair stiff trousers would stood quite well alone, without legs them. And could not properly said he wore hat, he covered a-top, like old building, something pitchy. Ham carrying his back small box his arm, Peggotty carrying another small box ours, turned lanes bestrewn bits chips little hillocks sand, went past gas-works, rope-walks, boat-builders’ yards, shipwrights’ yards, ship-breakers’ yards, caulkers’ yards, riggers’ lofts, smiths’ forges, great litter places, came upon dull waste I already seen distance; Ham said, ‘Yon’s house, Mas’r Davy!’ I looked directions, far I could stare wilderness, away sea, away river, house could I make out. There black barge, kind superannuated boat, far off, high dry ground, iron funnel sticking chimney smoking cosily; nothing else way habitation visible me. ‘That is it?’ said I. ‘That ship-looking thing?’ ‘That is it, Mas’r Davy,’ returned Ham. If Aladdin’s palace, roc’s egg all, I suppose I could charmed romantic idea living it. There delightful door cut side, roofed in, little windows it; wonderful charm was, real boat doubt upon water hundreds times, never intended lived in, dry land. That captivation me. If ever meant lived in, I might thought small, inconvenient, lonely; never designed use, became perfect abode. It beautifully clean inside, tidy possible. There table, Dutch clock, chest drawers, chest drawers tea-tray painting lady parasol, taking walk military-looking child trundling hoop. The tray kept tumbling down, bible; tray, tumbled down, would smashed quantity cups saucers teapot grouped around book. On walls common coloured pictures, framed glazed, scripture subjects; I never seen since hands pedlars, without seeing whole interior Peggotty’s brother’s house again, one view. Abraham red going sacrifice Isaac blue, Daniel yellow cast den green lions, prominent these. Over little mantelshelf, picture ‘Sarah Jane’ lugger, built Sunderland, real little wooden stern stuck it; work art, combining composition carpentry, I considered one enviable possessions world could afford. There hooks beams ceiling, use I divine then; lockers boxes conveniences sort, served seats eked chairs. All I saw first glance I crossed threshold--child-like, according theory--and Peggotty opened little door showed bedroom. It completest desirable bedroom ever seen--in stern vessel; little window, rudder used go through; little looking-glass, right height me, nailed wall, framed oyster-shells; little bed, room enough get into; nosegay seaweed blue mug table. The walls whitewashed white milk, patchwork counterpane made eyes quite ache brightness. One thing I particularly noticed delightful house, smell fish; searching, I took pocket-handkerchief wipe nose, I found smelt exactly wrapped lobster. On imparting discovery confidence Peggotty, she informed her brother dealt lobsters, crabs, crawfish; I afterwards found heap creatures, state wonderful conglomeration one another, never leaving pinching whatever laid hold of, usually found little wooden outhouse pots kettles kept. We welcomed civil woman white apron, I seen curtseying door I Ham’s back, quarter mile off. Likewise beautiful little girl (or I thought her so) necklace blue beads on, would not let kiss her I offered to, ran away hid herself. By by, dined sumptuous manner boiled dabs, melted butter, potatoes, chop me, hairy man good-natured face came home. As he called Peggotty ‘Lass’, gave her hearty smack cheek, I doubt, general propriety her conduct, he her brother; he turned out--being presently introduced Mr. Peggotty, master house. ‘Glad see you, sir,’ said Mr. Peggotty. ‘You will find us rough, sir, you will find us ready.’ I thanked him, replied I sure I happy delightful place. ‘How is Ma, sir?’ said Mr. Peggotty. ‘Did leave her pretty jolly?’ I gave Mr. Peggotty understand she jolly I could wish, she desired her compliments--which polite fiction part. ‘I am much obleeged her, I am sure,’ said Mr. Peggotty. ‘Well, sir, make here, fur fortnut, ‘long wi’ her,’ nodding his sister, ‘and Ham, little Them’ly, shall proud company.’ Having done honours his house hospitable manner, Mr. Peggotty went wash kettleful hot water, remarking ‘cold would never get his muck off’. He soon returned, greatly improved appearance; rubicund, I could not help thinking his face common lobsters, crabs, crawfish,--that went hot water black, came red. After tea, door shut made snug (the nights cold misty now), seemed delicious retreat imagination man could conceive. To hear wind getting sea, know fog creeping desolate flat outside, look fire, think house near one, one boat, like enchantment. Little Them’ly overcome her shyness, sitting side upon lowest least lockers, large enough us two, fitted chimney corner. Mrs. Peggotty white apron, knitting opposite side fire. Peggotty her needlework much home St. Paul’s bit wax-candle, never known roof. Ham, giving first lesson all-fours, trying recollect scheme telling fortunes dirty cards, printing fishy impressions his thumb cards he turned. Mr. Peggotty smoking his pipe. I felt time conversation confidence. ‘Mr. Peggotty!’ says I. ‘Sir,’ says he. ‘Did give son name Ham, lived sort ark?’ Mr. Peggotty seemed think deep idea, answered: ‘No, sir. I never giv name.’ ‘Who gave name, then?’ said I, putting question number two catechism Mr. Peggotty. ‘Why, sir, his father giv him,’ said Mr. Peggotty. ‘I thought his father!’ ‘My brother Joe his father,’ said Mr. Peggotty. ‘Dead, Mr. Peggotty?’ I hinted, respectful pause. ‘Drowndead,’ said Mr. Peggotty. I much surprised Mr. Peggotty Ham’s father, began wonder whether I mistaken his relationship anybody else there. I curious know, I made mind Mr. Peggotty. ‘Little Them’ly,’ I said, glancing her. ‘She daughter, is not she, Mr. Peggotty?’ ‘No, sir. My brother-in-law, Tom, her father.’ I could not help it. ‘--Dead, Mr. Peggotty?’ I hinted, another respectful silence. ‘Drowndead,’ said Mr. Peggotty. I felt difficulty resuming subject, got bottom yet, must get bottom somehow. So I said: ‘Have not ANY children, Mr. Peggotty?’ ‘No, master,’ he answered short laugh. ‘I am bacheldore.’ ‘A bachelor!’ I said, astonished. ‘Why, who is that, Mr. Peggotty?’ pointing person apron knitting. ‘That is Missis Gummidge,’ said Mr. Peggotty. ‘Gummidge, Mr. Peggotty?’ But point Peggotty--I mean peculiar Peggotty--made impressive motions ask questions, I could sit look silent company, time go bed. Then, privacy little cabin, she informed Ham Them’ly orphan nephew niece, host different times adopted childhood, left destitute: Mrs. Gummidge widow his partner boat, died poor. He poor man himself, said Peggotty, good gold true steel--those her similes. The subject, she informed me, he ever showed violent temper swore oath, generosity his; ever referred to, one them, he struck table heavy blow his right hand (had split one occasion), swore dreadful oath he would ‘Gormed’ he did not cut run good, ever mentioned again. It appeared, answer inquiries, nobody least idea etymology terrible verb passive gormed; regarded constituting solemn imprecation. I sensible entertainer’s goodness, listened women’s going bed another little crib like mine opposite end boat, Ham hanging two hammocks hooks I noticed roof, luxurious state mind, enhanced sleepy. As slumber gradually stole upon me, I heard wind howling sea coming across flat fiercely, I lazy apprehension great deep rising night. But I bethought I boat, all; man like Mr. Peggotty bad person board anything happen. Nothing happened, however, worse morning. Almost soon shone upon oyster-she will frame mirror I bed, little Them’ly, picking stones upon beach. ‘You are quite sailor, I suppose?’ I said Them’ly. I do not know I supposed anything kind, I felt act gallantry say something; shining sail close us made pretty little image itself, moment, her bright eye, came head say this. ‘No,’ replied Them’ly, shaking her head, ‘I am afraid sea.’ ‘Afraid!’ I said, becoming air boldness, looking big mighty ocean. ‘I an’t!’ ‘Ah! it is cruel,’ said Them’ly. ‘I seen cruel men. I seen tear boat big house, pieces.’ ‘I hope was not boat that--’ ‘That father drownded in?’ said Them’ly. ‘No. Not one, I never see boat.’ ‘Nor him?’ I asked her. Little Them’ly shook her head. ‘Not remember!’ Here coincidence! I immediately went explanation I never seen father; mother I always lived happiest state imaginable, lived then, always meant live so; father’s grave churchyard near house, shaded tree, beneath boughs I walked heard birds sing many pleasant morning. But differences Them’ly’s orphanhood mine, appeared. She lost her mother her father; her father’s grave one knew, except somewhere depths sea. ‘Besides,’ said Them’ly, she looked shells pebbles, ‘your father gentleman mother lady; father fisherman mother fisherman’s daughter, uncle Dan fisherman.’ ‘Dan Mr. Peggotty, he?’ said I. ‘Uncle Dan--yonder,’ answered Them’ly, nodding boat-house. ‘Yes. I mean him. He must good, I think?’ ‘Good?’ said Them’ly. ‘If I ever lady, I would give sky-blue coat diamond buttons, nankeen trousers, red velvet waistcoat, cocked hat, large gold watch, silver pipe, box money.’ I said I doubt Mr. Peggotty well deserved treasures. I must acknowledge I felt difficult picture quite his ease raiment proposed his grateful little niece, I particularly doubtful policy cocked hat; I kept sentiments myself. Little Them’ly stopped looked sky her enumeration articles, glorious vision. We went again, picking shells pebbles. ‘You would like lady?’ I said. Emily looked me, laughed nodded ‘yes’. ‘I like much. We would gentlefolks together, then. Me, uncle, Ham, Mrs. Gummidge. We would not mind then, comes stormy weather.---Not sakes, I mean. We would poor fishermen’s, sure, we would help ‘them money come hurt.’ This seemed satisfactory therefore improbable picture. I expressed pleasure contemplation it, little Them’ly emboldened say, shyly, ‘Do not think afraid sea, now?’ It quiet enough reassure me, I doubt I seen moderately large wave come tumbling in, I taken heels, awful recollection her drowned relations. However, I said ‘No,’ I added, ‘You do not seem either, though say are,’--for she walking much near brink sort old jetty wooden causeway strolled upon, I afraid her falling over. ‘I am afraid way,’ said little Them’ly. ‘But I wake blows, tremble think Uncle Dan Ham believe I hear ‘them crying help. That is I like much lady. But I am afraid way. Not bit. Look here!’ She started side, ran along jagged timber protruded place stood upon, overhung deep water height, without least defence. The incident impressed remembrance, I draughtsman I could draw form here, I dare say, accurately day, little Them’ly springing forward her destruction (as appeared me), look I never forgotten, directed far sea. The light, bold, fluttering little figure turned came back safe me, I soon laughed fears, cry I uttered; fruitlessly case, one near. But times since, manhood, many times been, I thought, Is possible, among possibilities hidden things, sudden rashness child her wild look far off, merciful attraction her danger, tempting her towards permitted part her dead father, her life might chance ending day? There time since I wondered whether, life her could revealed glance, revealed child could fully comprehend it, her preservation could depended motion hand, I ought held save her. There time since--I say lasted long, been--when I asked question, would better little Them’ly waters close her head morning sight; I answered Yes, would been. This may premature. I set soon, perhaps. But let stand. We strolled long way, loaded things thought curious, put stranded starfish carefully back water--I hardly know enough race moment quite certain whether reason feel obliged us so, reverse--and made way home Mr. Peggotty’s dwelling. We stopped lee lobster-outhouse exchange innocent kiss, went breakfast glowing health pleasure. ‘Like two young mavishes,’ Mr. Peggotty said. I knew meant, local dialect, like two young thrushes, received compliment. Of course I love little Them’ly. I sure I loved baby quite truly, quite tenderly, greater purity disinterestedness, enter best love later time life, high ennobling is. I sure fancy raised something round blue-eyed mite child, etherealized, made angel her. If, sunny forenoon, she spread little pair wings flown away eyes, I do not think I regarded much I reason expect. We used walk dim old flat Yarmouth loving manner, hours hours. The days sported us, Time grown yet, child too, always play. I told Them’ly I adored her, unless she confessed she adored I reduced necessity killing sword. She said she did, I doubt she did. As sense inequality, youthfulness, difficulty way, little Them’ly I trouble, future. We made provision growing older, growing younger. We admiration Mrs. Gummidge Peggotty, used whisper evening sat, lovingly, little locker side side, ‘Lor! was not beautiful!’ Mr. Peggotty smiled us behind his pipe, Ham grinned evening nothing else. They something sort pleasure us, I suppose, might pretty toy, pocket model Colosseum. I soon found Mrs. Gummidge always make herself agreeable she might expected do, circumstances her residence Mr. Peggotty. Mrs. Gummidge’s rather fretful disposition, she whimpered sometimes comfortable parties small establishment. I sorry her; moments would agreeable, I thought, Mrs. Gummidge convenient apartment her retire to, stopped her spirits revived. Mr. Peggotty went occasionally public-house called The Willing Mind. I discovered this, his second third evening visit, Mrs. Gummidge’s looking Dutch clock, eight nine, saying he there, that, more, she known morning he would go there. Mrs. Gummidge low state day, burst tears forenoon, fire smoked. ‘I lone lorn creetur’,’ Mrs. Gummidge’s words, unpleasant occurrence took place, ‘and everythink goes contrary me.’ ‘Oh, it will soon leave off,’ said Peggotty--I mean Peggotty--‘and besides, know, it is disagreeable us.’ ‘I feel more,’ said Mrs. Gummidge. It cold day, cutting blasts wind. Mrs. Gummidge’s peculiar corner fireside seemed warmest snuggest place, her chair certainly easiest, did not suit her day all. She constantly complaining cold, occasioning visitation her back she called ‘the creeps’. At last she she would tears subject, said she ‘a lone lorn creetur’ everythink went contrary her’. ‘It certainly cold,’ said Peggotty. ‘Everybody must feel so.’ ‘I feel people,’ said Mrs. Gummidge. So dinner; Mrs. Gummidge always helped immediately me, preference given visitor distinction. The fish small bony, potatoes little burnt. We acknowledged felt something disappointment; Mrs. Gummidge said she felt did, she would tears again, made former declaration great bitterness. Accordingly, Mr. Peggotty came home nine of the clock, unfortunate Mrs. Gummidge knitting her corner, wretched miserable condition. Peggotty working cheerfully. Ham patching great pair waterboots; I, little Them’ly side, reading them. Mrs. Gummidge never made remark forlorn sigh, never raised her eyes since tea. ‘Well, Mates,’ said Mr. Peggotty, taking his seat, ‘and you?’ We said something, looked something, welcome him, except Mrs. Gummidge, shook her head her knitting. ‘What is amiss?’ said Mr. Peggotty, clap his hands. ‘Cheer up, old Mawther!’ (Mr. Peggotty meant old girl.) Mrs. Gummidge appear able cheer up. She took old black silk handkerchief wiped her eyes; instead putting her pocket, kept out, wiped again, still kept out, ready use. ‘What is amiss, dame?’ said Mr. Peggotty. ‘Nothing,’ returned Mrs. Gummidge. ‘You have come The Willing Mind, Dan’l?’ ‘Why yes, I have took short spell The Willing Mind tonight,’ said Mr. Peggotty. ‘I am sorry I drive there,’ said Mrs. Gummidge. ‘Drive! I do not want driving,’ returned Mr. Peggotty honest laugh. ‘I go ready.’ ‘Very ready,’ said Mrs. Gummidge, shaking her head, wiping her eyes. ‘Yes, yes, ready. I sorry along you are ready.’ ‘Along you! It an’t along you!’ said Mr. Peggotty. ‘Do not ye believe bit it.’ ‘Yes, yes, is,’ cried Mrs. Gummidge. ‘I know I am. I know I lone lorn creetur’, everythink goes contrary me, I go contrary everybody. Yes, yes. I feel people do, I show more. It is misfortun’.’ I really could not help thinking, I sat taking this, misfortune extended members family besides Mrs. Gummidge. But Mr. Peggotty made retort, answering another entreaty Mrs. Gummidge cheer up. ‘I an’t I could wish be,’ said Mrs. Gummidge. ‘I far it. I know I am. My troubles made contrary. I feel troubles, make contrary. I wish I did not feel ‘them, I do. I wish I could hardened ‘them, I an’t. I make house uncomfortable. I do not wonder it. I have made sister day, Master Davy.’ Here I suddenly melted, roared out, ‘No, have not, Mrs. Gummidge,’ great mental distress. ‘It is far right I it,’ said Mrs. Gummidge. ‘It an’t fit return. I better go house die. I lone lorn creetur’, much better make contrary here. If thinks must go contrary me, I must go contrary myself, let go contrary parish. Dan’l, I would better go house, die riddance!’ Mrs. Gummidge retired words, betook herself bed. When she gone, Mr. Peggotty, exhibited trace feeling profoundest sympathy, looked round upon us, nodding his head lively expression sentiment still animating his face, said whisper: ‘She is thinking old ‘un!’ I quite understand old one Mrs. Gummidge supposed fixed her mind upon, Peggotty, seeing bed, explained late Mr. Gummidge; her brother always took received truth occasions, always moving effect upon him. Some time he his hammock night, I heard repeat Ham, ‘Poor thing! She is thinking old ‘un!’ And whenever Mrs. Gummidge overcome similar manner remainder stay (which happened times), he always said thing extenuation circumstance, always tenderest commiseration. So fortnight slipped away, varied nothing variation tide, altered Mr. Peggotty’s times going coming in, altered Ham’s engagements also. When latter unemployed, he sometimes walked us show us boats ships, twice he took us row. I do not know one slight set impressions particularly associated place another, though I believe obtains people, reference especially associations childhood. I never hear name, read name, Yarmouth, I reminded certain Sunday morning beach, bells ringing church, little Them’ly leaning shoulder, Ham lazily dropping stones water, sun, away sea, breaking heavy mist, showing us ships, like shadows. At last day came going home. I bore separation Mr. Peggotty Mrs. Gummidge, agony mind leaving little Them’ly piercing. We went arm-in-arm public-house carrier put up, I promised, road, write her. (I redeemed promise afterwards, characters larger apartments usually announced manuscript, let.) We greatly overcome parting; ever, life, I void made heart, I one made day. Now, time I visit, I ungrateful home again, thought little nothing it. But I sooner turned towards it, reproachful young conscience seemed point way ready finger; I felt, sinking spirits, nest, mother comforter friend. This gained upon went along; nearer drew, familiar objects became passed, excited I get there, run her arms. But Peggotty, instead sharing transports, tried check (though kindly), looked confused sorts. Blunderstone Rookery would come, however, spite her, carrier’s horse pleased--and did. How well I recollect it, cold grey afternoon, dull sky, threatening rain! The door opened, I looked, half laughing half crying pleasant agitation, mother. It she, strange servant. ‘Why, Peggotty!’ I said, ruefully, ‘is not she come home?’ ‘Yes, yes, Master Davy,’ said Peggotty. ‘She is come home. Wait bit, Master Davy, I will--I will tell something.’ Between her agitation, her natural awkwardness getting cart, Peggotty making extraordinary festoon herself, I felt blank strange tell her so. When she got down, she took hand; led me, wondering, kitchen; shut door. ‘Peggotty!’ said I, quite frightened. ‘What is matter?’ ‘Nothing’s matter, bless you, Master Davy dear!’ she answered, assuming air sprightliness. ‘Something is matter, I am sure. Where is mama?’ ‘Where is mama, Master Davy?’ repeated Peggotty. ‘Yes. Why has not she come gate, come for? Oh, Peggotty!’ My eyes full, I felt I going tumble down. ‘Bless precious boy!’ cried Peggotty, taking hold me. ‘What it? Speak, pet!’ ‘Not dead, too! Oh, she is dead, Peggotty?’ Peggotty cried No! astonishing volume voice; sat down, began pant, said I given her turn. I gave her hug take away turn, give her another turn right direction, stood her, looking her anxious inquiry. ‘You see, dear, I told now,’ said Peggotty, ‘but I had not opportunity. I ought made it, perhaps, I could not azackly’--that always substitute exactly, Peggotty’s militia words--‘bring mind it.’ ‘Go on, Peggotty,’ said I, frightened before. ‘Master Davy,’ said Peggotty, untying her bonnet shaking hand, speaking breathless sort way. ‘What think? You got Pa!’ I trembled, turned white. Something--I do not know what, how--connected grave churchyard, raising dead, seemed strike like unwholesome wind. ‘A new one,’ said Peggotty. ‘A new one?’ I repeated. Peggotty gave gasp, she swallowing something hard, and, putting her hand, said: ‘Come see him.’ ‘I do not want see him.’ --‘And mama,’ said Peggotty. I ceased draw back, went straight best parlour, she left me. On one side fire, sat mother; other, Mr. Murdstone. My mother dropped her work, arose hurriedly, timidly I thought. ‘Now, Clara dear,’ said Mr. Murdstone. ‘Recollect! control yourself, always control yourself! Davy boy, do?’ I gave hand. After moment suspense, I went kissed mother: she kissed me, patted gently shoulder, sat her work. I could look her, I could look him, I knew quite well he looking us both; I turned window looked there, shrubs drooping heads cold. As soon I could creep away, I crept upstairs. My old dear bedroom changed, I lie long way off. I rambled downstairs find anything like itself, altered seemed; roamed yard. I soon started back there, empty dog-kennel filled great dog--deep mouthed black-haired like Him--and he angry sight me, sprang get me. CHAPTER 4. I FALL INTO DISGRACE If room bed removed sentient thing could give evidence, I might appeal day--who sleeps now, I wonder!--to bear witness heavy heart I carried it. I went there, hearing dog yard bark way I climbed stairs; and, looking blank strange upon room room looked upon me, sat small hands crossed, thought. I thought oddest things. Of shape room, cracks ceiling, paper walls, flaws window-glass making ripples dimples prospect, washing-stand rickety three legs, discontented something it, reminded Mrs. Gummidge influence old one. I crying time, but, except I conscious cold dejected, I sure I never thought I cried. At last desolation I began consider I dreadfully love little Them’ly, torn away her come one seemed want me, care me, half much she did. This made miserable piece business it, I rolled corner counterpane, cried sleep. I awoke somebody saying ‘Here he is!’ uncovering hot head. My mother Peggotty come look me, one done it. ‘Davy,’ said mother. ‘What is matter?’ I thought strange she ask me, answered, ‘Nothing.’ I turned face, I recollect, hide trembling lip, answered her greater truth. ‘Davy,’ said mother. ‘Davy, child!’ I dare say words she could uttered would affected much, then, her calling her child. I hid tears bedclothes, pressed her hand, she would raised up. ‘This doing, Peggotty, cruel thing!’ said mother. ‘I doubt it. How reconcile conscience, I wonder, prejudice boy me, anybody dear me? What mean it, Peggotty?’ Poor Peggotty lifted her hands eyes, answered, sort paraphrase grace I usually repeated dinner, ‘Lord forgive you, Mrs. Copperfield, said minute, may never truly sorry!’ ‘It is enough distract me,’ cried mother. ‘In honeymoon, too, inveterate enemy might relent, one would think, envy little peace mind happiness. Davy, naughty boy! Peggotty, savage creature! Oh, dear me!’ cried mother, turning one us other, her pettish wilful manner, ‘what troublesome world is, one right expect agreeable possible!’ I felt touch hand I knew neither Peggotty’s, slipped feet bed-side. It Mr. Murdstone’s hand, he kept arm he said: ‘What is this? Clara, love, forgotten?--Firmness, dear!’ ‘I sorry, Edward,’ said mother. ‘I meant good, I uncomfortable.’ ‘Indeed!’ he answered. ‘That is bad hearing, soon, Clara.’ ‘I say it is hard I made now,’ returned mother, pouting; ‘and is--very hard--is not it?’ He drew her him, whispered her ear, kissed her. I knew well, I saw mother’s head lean upon his shoulder, her arm touch his neck--I knew well he could mould her pliant nature form he chose, I know, now, he it. ‘Go below, love,’ said Mr. Murdstone. ‘David I come down, together. My friend,’ turning darkening face Peggotty, he watched mother out, dismissed her nod smile; ‘do know mistress’s name?’ ‘She mistress long time, sir,’ answered Peggotty, ‘I ought know it.’ ‘That is true,’ he answered. ‘But I thought I heard you, I came upstairs, address her name hers. She taken mine, know. Will remember that?’ Peggotty, uneasy glances me, curtseyed herself room without replying; seeing, I suppose, she expected go, excuse remaining. When two left alone, he shut door, sitting chair, holding standing him, looked steadily eyes. I felt attracted, less steadily, his. As I recall opposed thus, face face, I seem hear heart beat fast high. ‘David,’ he said, making his lips thin, pressing together, ‘if I obstinate horse dog deal with, think I do?’ ‘I do not know.’ ‘I beat him.’ I answered kind breathless whisper, I felt, silence, breath shorter now. ‘I make wince, smart. I say myself, “I will conquer fellow”; cost blood he had, I it. What upon face?’ ‘Dirt,’ I said. He knew mark tears well I. But he asked question twenty times, time twenty blows, I believe baby heart would burst I would told so. ‘You good deal intelligence little fellow,’ he said, grave smile belonged him, ‘and understood well, I see. Wash face, sir, come me.’ He pointed washing-stand, I made like Mrs. Gummidge, motioned his head obey directly. I little doubt then, I less doubt now, he would knocked without least compunction, I hesitated. ‘Clara, dear,’ he said, I done his bidding, he walked parlour, his hand still arm; ‘you made uncomfortable more, I hope. We shall soon improve youthful humours.’ God help me, I might improved whole life, I might made another creature perhaps, life, kind word season. A word encouragement explanation, pity childish ignorance, welcome home, reassurance home, might made dutiful heart henceforth, instead hypocritical outside, might made respect instead hate him. I thought mother sorry see standing room scared strange, that, presently, I stole chair, she followed her eyes sorrowfully still--missing, perhaps, freedom childish tread--but word spoken, time gone. We dined alone, three together. He seemed fond mother--I afraid I liked none better that--and she fond him. I gathered said, elder sister his coming stay them, she expected evening. I certain whether I found then, afterwards, that, without actively concerned business, he share in, annual charge upon profits of, wine-merchant’s house London, his family connected his great-grandfather’s time, his sister similar interest; I may mention place, whether no. After dinner, sitting fire, I meditating escape Peggotty without hardihood slip away, lest offend master house, coach drove garden-gate he went receive visitor. My mother followed him. I timidly following her, she turned round parlour door, dusk, taking her embrace she used do, whispered love new father obedient him. She hurriedly secretly, wrong, tenderly; and, putting her hand behind her, held mine it, came near he standing garden, she let mine go, drew his arm. It Miss Murdstone arrived, gloomy-looking lady she was; dark, like her brother, she greatly resembled face voice; heavy eyebrows, nearly meeting her large nose, if, disabled wrongs her sex wearing whiskers, she carried account. She brought her two uncompromising hard black boxes, her initials lids hard brass nails. When she paid coachman she took her money hard steel purse, she kept purse jail bag hung upon her arm heavy chain, shut like bite. I never, time, seen metallic lady altogether Miss Murdstone was. She brought parlour many tokens welcome, formally recognized mother new near relation. Then she looked me, said: ‘Is boy, sister-in-law?’ My mother acknowledged me. ‘Generally speaking,’ said Miss Murdstone, ‘I do not like boys. How d’ye do, boy?’ Under encouraging circumstances, I replied I well, I hoped she same; indifferent grace, Miss Murdstone disposed two words: ‘Wants manner!’ Having uttered which, great distinctness, she begged favour shown her room, became time forth place awe dread, wherein two black boxes never seen open known left unlocked, (for I peeped twice she out) numerous little steel fetters rivets, Miss Murdstone embellished herself she dressed, generally hung upon looking-glass formidable array. As well I could make out, she come good, intention ever going again. She began ‘help’ mother next morning, store-closet day, putting things rights, making havoc old arrangements. Almost first remarkable thing I observed Miss Murdstone was, her constantly haunted suspicion servants man secreted somewhere premises. Under influence delusion, she dived coal-cellar untimely hours, scarcely ever opened door dark cupboard without clapping again, belief she got him. Though nothing airy Miss Murdstone, she perfect Lark point getting up. She (and, I believe hour, looking man) anybody house stirring. Peggotty gave her opinion she even slept one eye open; I could concur idea; I tried hearing suggestion thrown out, found could not done. On first morning her arrival she ringing her bell cock-crow. When mother came breakfast going make tea, Miss Murdstone gave her kind peck cheek, her nearest approach kiss, said: ‘Now, Clara, dear, I come here, know, relieve trouble I can. You are much pretty thoughtless’--my mother blushed laughed, seemed dislike character--‘to duties imposed upon undertaken me. If you will good give keys, dear, I will attend sort thing future.’ From time, Miss Murdstone kept keys her little jail day, her pillow night, mother I had. My mother suffer her authority pass her without shadow protest. One night Miss Murdstone developing certain household plans her brother, he signified his approbation, mother suddenly began cry, said she thought she might consulted. ‘Clara!’ said Mr. Murdstone sternly. ‘Clara! I wonder you.’ ‘Oh, it is well say wonder, Edward!’ cried mother, ‘and it is well talk firmness, would not like yourself.’ Firmness, I may observe, grand quality Mr. Miss Murdstone took stand. However I might expressed comprehension time, I called upon, I nevertheless clearly comprehend way, another name tyranny; certain gloomy, arrogant, devil’s humour, both. The creed, I state now, this. Mr. Murdstone firm; nobody his world firm Mr. Murdstone; nobody else his world firm all, everybody bent his firmness. Miss Murdstone exception. She might firm, relationship, inferior tributary degree. My mother another exception. She might firm, must be; bearing firmness, firmly believing firmness upon earth. ‘It is hard,’ said mother, ‘that house--’ ‘My house?’ repeated Mr. Murdstone. ‘Clara!’ ‘OUR house, I mean,’ faltered mother, evidently frightened--‘I hope must know I mean, Edward--it is hard YOUR house I may word say domestic matters. I sure I managed well married. There is evidence,’ said mother, sobbing; ‘ask Peggotty I did not well I was not interfered with!’ ‘Edward,’ said Miss Murdstone, ‘let end this. I go tomorrow.’ ‘Jane Murdstone,’ said her brother, ‘be silent! How dare insinuate do not know character better words imply?’ ‘I sure,’ poor mother went on, grievous disadvantage, many tears, ‘I do not want anybody go. I miserable unhappy anybody go. I do not ask much. I unreasonable. I want consulted sometimes. I much obliged anybody assists me, I want consulted mere form, sometimes. I thought pleased, once, little inexperienced girlish, Edward--I sure said so--but seem hate now, severe.’ ‘Edward,’ said Miss Murdstone, again, ‘let end this. I go tomorrow.’ ‘Jane Murdstone,’ thundered Mr. Murdstone. ‘Will silent? How dare you?’ Miss Murdstone made jail-delivery her pocket-handkerchief, held her eyes. ‘Clara,’ he continued, looking mother, ‘you surprise me! You astound me! Yes, I satisfaction thought marrying inexperienced artless person, forming her character, infusing amount firmness decision stood need. But Jane Murdstone kind enough come assistance endeavour, assume, sake, condition something like housekeeper’s, she meets base return--’ ‘Oh, pray, pray, Edward,’ cried mother, ‘do not accuse ungrateful. I sure I ungrateful. No one ever said I before. I many faults, that. Oh, do not, dear!’ ‘When Jane Murdstone meets, I say,’ he went on, waiting mother silent, ‘with base return, feeling mine chilled altered.’ ‘Do not, love, say that!’ implored mother piteously. ‘Oh, do not, Edward! I cannot bear hear it. Whatever I am, I affectionate. I know I affectionate. I would not say it, I was not sure I am. Ask Peggotty. I sure she will tell I am affectionate.’ ‘There extent mere weakness, Clara,’ said Mr. Murdstone reply, ‘that least weight me. You lose breath.’ ‘Pray let us friends,’ said mother, ‘I could not live coldness unkindness. I sorry. I great many defects, I know, it is good you, Edward, strength mind, endeavour correct me. Jane, I do not object anything. I quite broken-hearted thought leaving--’ My mother much overcome go on. ‘Jane Murdstone,’ said Mr. Murdstone his sister, ‘any harsh words us are, I hope, uncommon. It fault unusual occurrence taken place tonight. I betrayed another. Nor fault. You betrayed another. Let us try forget it. And this,’ he added, magnanimous words, ‘is fit scene boy--David, go bed!’ I could hardly find door, tears stood eyes. I sorry mother’s distress; I groped way out, groped way room dark, without even heart say good night Peggotty, get candle her. When her coming look me, hour afterwards, awoke me, she said mother gone bed poorly, Mr. Miss Murdstone sitting alone. Going next morning rather earlier usual, I paused outside parlour door, hearing mother’s voice. She earnestly humbly entreating Miss Murdstone’s pardon, lady granted, perfect reconciliation took place. I never knew mother afterwards give opinion matter, without first appealing Miss Murdstone, without first ascertained sure means, Miss Murdstone’s opinion was; I never saw Miss Murdstone, temper (she infirm way), move her hand towards her bag she going take keys offer resign mother, without seeing mother terrible fright. The gloomy taint Murdstone blood, darkened Murdstone religion, austere wrathful. I thought, since, assuming character necessary consequence Mr. Murdstone’s firmness, would not allow let anybody utmost weight severest penalties he could find excuse for. Be may, I well remember tremendous visages used go church, changed air place. Again, dreaded Sunday comes round, I file old pew first, like guarded captive brought condemned service. Again, Miss Murdstone, black velvet gown, looks made pall, follows close upon me; mother; her husband. There Peggotty now, old time. Again, I listen Miss Murdstone mumbling responses, emphasizing dread words cruel relish. Again, I see her dark eyes roll round church she says ‘miserable sinners’, she calling congregation names. Again, I catch rare glimpses mother, moving her lips timidly two, one muttering ear like low thunder. Again, I wonder sudden fear whether likely good old clergyman wrong, Mr. Miss Murdstone right, angels Heaven destroying angels. Again, I move finger relax muscle face, Miss Murdstone pokes her prayer-book, makes side ache. Yes, again, walk home, I note neighbours looking mother me, whispering. Again, three go arm-in-arm, I linger behind alone, I follow looks, wonder mother’s step really light I seen it, gaiety her beauty really almost worried away. Again, I wonder whether neighbours call mind, I do, used walk home together, she I; I wonder stupidly that, dreary dismal day. There talk occasions going boarding-school. Mr. Miss Murdstone originated it, mother course agreed them. Nothing, however, concluded subject yet. In meantime, I learnt lessons home. Shall I ever forget lessons! They presided nominally mother, really Mr. Murdstone his sister, always present, found favourable occasion giving mother lessons miscalled firmness, bane lives. I believe I kept home purpose. I apt enough learn, willing enough, mother I lived alone together. I faintly remember learning alphabet her knee. To day, I look upon fat black letters primer, puzzling novelty shapes, easy good-nature O Q S, seem present used do. But recall feeling disgust reluctance. On contrary, I seem walked along path flowers far crocodile-book, cheered gentleness mother’s voice manner way. But solemn lessons succeeded those, I remember death-blow peace, grievous daily drudgery misery. They long, numerous, hard--perfectly unintelligible, them, me--and I generally much bewildered I believe poor mother herself. Let remember used be, bring one morning back again. I come second-best parlour breakfast, books, exercise-book, slate. My mother ready her writing-desk, half ready Mr. Murdstone his easy-chair window (though he pretends reading book), Miss Murdstone, sitting near mother stringing steel beads. The sight two influence me, I begin feel words I infinite pains get head, sliding away, going I do not know where. I wonder go, by? I hand first book mother. Perhaps grammar, perhaps history, geography. I take last drowning look page I give her hand, start aloud racing pace I got fresh. I trip word. Mr. Murdstone looks up. I trip another word. Miss Murdstone looks up. I redden, tumble half-a-dozen words, stop. I think mother would show book she dared, she dare, she says softly: ‘Oh, Davy, Davy!’ ‘Now, Clara,’ says Mr. Murdstone, ‘be firm boy. Do not say, “Oh, Davy, Davy!” That is childish. He knows his lesson, he know it.’ ‘He NOT know it,’ Miss Murdstone interposes awfully. ‘I really afraid he not,’ says mother. ‘Then, see, Clara,’ returns Miss Murdstone, ‘you give book back, make know it.’ ‘Yes, certainly,’ says mother; ‘that I intend do, dear Jane. Now, Davy, try more, do not stupid.’ I obey first clause injunction trying more, successful second, I stupid. I tumble I get old place, point I right before, stop think. But I cannot think lesson. I think number yards net Miss Murdstone’s cap, price Mr. Murdstone’s dressing-gown, ridiculous problem I business with, do not want anything with. Mr. Murdstone makes movement impatience I expecting long time. Miss Murdstone same. My mother glances submissively them, shuts book, lays arrear worked tasks done. There pile arrears soon, swells like rolling snowball. The bigger gets, stupid I get. The case hopeless, I feel I wallowing bog nonsense, I give idea getting out, abandon fate. The despairing way mother I look other, I blunder on, truly melancholy. But greatest effect miserable lessons mother (thinking nobody observing her) tries give cue motion her lips. At instant, Miss Murdstone, lying wait nothing else along, says deep warning voice: ‘Clara!’ My mother starts, colours, smiles faintly. Mr. Murdstone comes his chair, takes book, throws boxes ears it, turns room shoulders. Even lessons done, worst yet happen, shape appalling sum. This invented me, delivered orally Mr. Murdstone, begins, ‘If I go cheesemonger’s shop, buy five thousand double-Gloucester cheeses fourpence-halfpenny each, present payment’--at I see Miss Murdstone secretly overjoyed. I pore cheeses without result enlightenment dinner-time, when, made Mulatto getting dirt slate pores skin, I slice bread help cheeses, considered disgrace rest evening. It seems me, distance time, unfortunate studies generally took course. I could done well I without Murdstones; influence Murdstones upon like fascination two snakes wretched young bird. Even I get morning tolerable credit, much gained dinner; Miss Murdstone never could endure see untasked, I rashly made show unemployed, called her brother’s attention saying, ‘Clara, dear, there is nothing like work--give boy exercise’; caused clapped new labour, then. As recreation children age, I little that; gloomy theology Murdstones made children swarm little vipers (though WAS child set midst Disciples), held contaminated one another. The natural result treatment, continued, I suppose, six months more, make sullen, dull, dogged. I made less sense daily shut alienated mother. I believe I almost stupefied one circumstance. It this. My father left small collection books little room upstairs, I access (for adjoined own) nobody else house ever troubled. From blessed little room, Roderick Random, Peregrine Pickle, Humphrey Clinker, Tom Jones, Vicar Wakefield, Don Quixote, Gil Blas, Robinson Crusoe, came out, glorious host, keep company. They kept alive fancy, hope something beyond place time,--they, Arabian Nights, Tales Genii,--and harm; whatever harm me; I knew nothing it. It astonishing now, I found time, midst porings blunderings heavier themes, read books I did. It curious I could ever consoled small troubles (which great troubles me), impersonating favourite characters them--as I did--and putting Mr. Miss Murdstone bad ones--which I too. I Tom Jones (a child’s Tom Jones, harmless creature) week together. I sustained idea Roderick Random month stretch, I verily believe. I greedy relish volumes Voyages Travels--I forget what, now--that shelves; days days I remember gone region house, armed centre-piece old set boot-trees--the perfect realization Captain Somebody, Royal British Navy, danger beset savages, resolved sell his life great price. The Captain never lost dignity, his ears boxed Latin Grammar. I did; Captain Captain hero, despite grammars languages world, dead alive. This constant comfort. When I think it, picture always rises mind, summer evening, boys play churchyard, I sitting bed, reading life. Every barn neighbourhood, every stone church, every foot churchyard, association own, mind, connected books, stood locality made famous them. I seen Tom Pipes go climbing church-steeple; I watched Strap, knapsack his back, stopping rest upon wicket-gate; I know Commodore Trunnion held club Mr. Pickle, parlour little village alehouse. The reader understands, well I do, I I came point youthful history I coming again. One morning I went parlour books, I found mother looking anxious, Miss Murdstone looking firm, Mr. Murdstone binding something round bottom cane--a lithe limber cane, he left binding I came in, poised switched air. ‘I tell you, Clara,’ said Mr. Murdstone, ‘I often flogged myself.’ ‘To sure; course,’ said Miss Murdstone. ‘Certainly, dear Jane,’ faltered mother, meekly. ‘But--but think Edward good?’ ‘Do think Edward harm, Clara?’ asked Mr. Murdstone, gravely. ‘That is point,’ said his sister. To mother returned, ‘Certainly, dear Jane,’ said more. I felt apprehensive I personally interested dialogue, sought Mr. Murdstone’s eye lighted mine. ‘Now, David,’ he said--and I saw cast he said it--‘you must far careful today usual.’ He gave cane another poise, another switch; finished his preparation it, laid beside him, impressive look, took his book. This good freshener presence mind, beginning. I felt words lessons slipping off, one one, line line, entire page; I tried lay hold them; seemed, I may express it, put skates on, skim away smoothness checking. We began badly, went worse. I come idea distinguishing rather, conceiving I well prepared; turned quite mistake. Book book added heap failures, Miss Murdstone firmly watchful us time. And came last five thousand cheeses (canes he made day, I remember), mother burst crying. ‘Clara!’ said Miss Murdstone, her warning voice. ‘I quite well, dear Jane, I think,’ said mother. I saw wink, solemnly, his sister, he rose said, taking cane: ‘Why, Jane, hardly expect Clara bear, perfect firmness, worry torment David occasioned her today. That would stoical. Clara greatly strengthened improved, hardly expect much her. David, I go upstairs, boy.’ As he took door, mother ran towards us. Miss Murdstone said, ‘Clara! perfect fool?’ interfered. I saw mother stop her ears then, I heard her crying. He walked room slowly gravely--I certain he delight formal parade executing justice--and got there, suddenly twisted head his arm. ‘Mr. Murdstone! Sir!’ I cried him. ‘Do not! Pray do not beat me! I tried learn, sir, I cannot learn Miss Murdstone by. I cannot indeed!’ ‘Cannot you, indeed, David?’ he said. ‘We will try that.’ He head vice, I twined round somehow, stopped moment, entreating beat me. It moment I stopped him, he cut heavily instant afterwards, instant I caught hand he held mouth, teeth, bit through. It sets teeth edge think it. He beat then, he would beaten death. Above noise made, I heard running stairs, crying out--I heard mother crying out--and Peggotty. Then he gone; door locked outside; I lying, fevered hot, torn, sore, raging puny way, upon floor. How well I recollect, I became quiet, unnatural stillness seemed reign whole house! How well I remember, smart passion began cool, wicked I began feel! I sat listening long while, sound. I crawled floor, saw face glass, swollen, red, ugly almost frightened me. My stripes sore stiff, made cry afresh, I moved; nothing guilt I felt. It lay heavier breast I atrocious criminal, I dare say. It begun grow dark, I shut window (I lying, part, head upon sill, turns crying, dozing, looking listlessly out), key turned, Miss Murdstone came bread meat, milk. These she put upon table without word, glaring exemplary firmness, retired, locking door her. Long dark I sat there, wondering whether anybody else would come. When appeared improbable night, I undressed, went bed; and, there, I began wonder fearfully would done me. Whether criminal act I committed? Whether I taken custody, sent prison? Whether I danger hanged? I never shall forget waking, next morning; cheerful fresh first moment, weighed stale dismal oppression remembrance. Miss Murdstone reappeared I bed; told me, many words, I free walk garden half hour longer; retired, leaving door open, I might avail permission. I so, every morning imprisonment, lasted five days. If I could seen mother alone, I gone knees her besought her forgiveness; I saw one, Miss Murdstone excepted, whole time--except evening prayers parlour; I escorted Miss Murdstone everybody else placed; I stationed, young outlaw, alone near door; whence I solemnly conducted jailer, one arose devotional posture. I observed mother far she could be, kept her face another way I never saw it; Mr. Murdstone’s hand bound large linen wrapper. The length five days I convey idea one. They occupy place years remembrance. The way I listened incidents house made audible me; ringing bells, opening shutting doors, murmuring voices, footsteps stairs; laughing, whistling, singing, outside, seemed dismal anything else solitude disgrace--the uncertain pace hours, especially night, I would wake thinking morning, find family yet gone bed, length night yet come--the depressed dreams nightmares I had--the return day, noon, afternoon, evening, boys played churchyard, I watched distance within room, ashamed show window lest know I prisoner--the strange sensation never hearing speak--the fleeting intervals something like cheerfulness, came eating drinking, went away it--the setting rain one evening, fresh smell, coming faster faster church, gathering night seemed quench gloom, fear, remorse--all appears gone round round years instead days, vividly strongly stamped remembrance. On last night restraint, I awakened hearing name spoken whisper. I started bed, putting arms dark, said: ‘Is you, Peggotty?’ There immediate answer, presently I heard name again, tone mysterious awful, I think I gone fit, occurred must come keyhole. I groped way door, putting lips keyhole, whispered: ‘Is you, Peggotty dear?’ ‘Yes, precious Davy,’ she replied. ‘Be soft mouse, Cat’ll hear us.’ I understood mean Miss Murdstone, sensible urgency case; her room close by. ‘How is mama, dear Peggotty? Is she angry me?’ I could hear Peggotty crying softly her side keyhole, I mine, she answered. ‘No. Not very.’ ‘What going done me, Peggotty dear? Do know?’ ‘School. Near London,’ Peggotty’s answer. I obliged get her repeat it, she spoke first time quite throat, consequence forgotten take mouth away keyhole put ear there; though her words tickled good deal, I did not hear them. ‘When, Peggotty?’ ‘Tomorrow.’ ‘Is reason Miss Murdstone took clothes drawers?’ she done, though I forgotten mention it. ‘Yes,’ said Peggotty. ‘Box.’ ‘Shall not I see mama?’ ‘Yes,’ said Peggotty. ‘Morning.’ Then Peggotty fitted her mouth close keyhole, delivered words much feeling earnestness keyhole ever medium communicating, I venture assert: shooting broken little sentence convulsive little burst own. ‘Davy, dear. If I are not azackly intimate you. Lately, I used be. It are not I do not love you. Just well more, pretty poppet. It is I thought better you. And someone else besides. Davy, darling, listening? Can hear?’ ‘Ye-ye-ye-yes, Peggotty!’ I sobbed. ‘My own!’ said Peggotty, infinite compassion. ‘What I want say, is. That must never forget me. For I will never forget you. And I will take much care mama, Davy. As ever I took you. And I will not leave her. The day may come she will glad lay her poor head. On her stupid, cross old Peggotty’s arm again. And I will write you, dear. Though I are not scholar. And I will--I will--’ Peggotty fell kissing keyhole, she could not kiss me. ‘Thank you, dear Peggotty!’ said I. ‘Oh, thank you! Thank you! Will promise one thing, Peggotty? Will write tell Mr. Peggotty little Them’ly, Mrs. Gummidge Ham, I bad might suppose, I sent ‘them love--especially little Them’ly? Will you, please, Peggotty?’ The kind soul promised, us kissed keyhole greatest affection--I patted hand, I recollect, her honest face--and parted. From night grew breast feeling Peggotty I cannot well define. She replace mother; one could that; she came vacancy heart, closed upon her, I felt towards her something I never felt human being. It sort comical affection, too; yet she died, I cannot think I done, I acted tragedy would me. In morning Miss Murdstone appeared usual, told I going school; altogether news she supposed. She also informed I dressed, I come downstairs parlour, breakfast. There, I found mother, pale red eyes: whose arms I ran, begged her pardon suffering soul. ‘Oh, Davy!’ she said. ‘That could hurt anyone I love! Try better, pray better! I forgive you; I grieved, Davy, bad passions heart.’ They persuaded her I wicked fellow, she sorry going away. I felt sorely. I tried eat parting breakfast, tears dropped upon bread-and-butter, trickled tea. I saw mother look sometimes, glance watchful Miss Murdstone, look down, look away. ‘Master Copperfield’s box there!’ said Miss Murdstone, wheels heard gate. I looked Peggotty, she; neither she Mr. Murdstone appeared. My former acquaintance, carrier, door. The box taken his cart, lifted in. ‘Clara!’ said Miss Murdstone, her warning note. ‘Ready, dear Jane,’ returned mother. ‘Good-bye, Davy. You going good. Good-bye, child. You come home holidays, better boy.’ ‘Clara!’ Miss Murdstone repeated. ‘Certainly, dear Jane,’ replied mother, holding me. ‘I forgive you, dear boy. God bless you!’ ‘Clara!’ Miss Murdstone repeated. Miss Murdstone good enough take cart, say way she hoped I would repent, I came bad end; I got cart, lazy horse walked it. CHAPTER 5. I AM SENT AWAY FROM HOME We might gone half mile, pocket-handkerchief quite wet through, carrier stopped short. Looking ascertain what, I saw, My amazement, Peggotty burst hedge climb cart. She took her arms, squeezed her stays pressure nose extremely painful, though I never thought till afterwards I found tender. Not single word Peggotty speak. Releasing one her arms, she put her pocket elbow, brought paper bags cakes she crammed pockets, purse she put hand, one word she say. After another final squeeze arms, she got cart ran away; and, belief is, always been, without solitary button her gown. I picked one, several rolling about, treasured keepsake long time. The carrier looked me, inquire she coming back. I shook head, said I thought not. ‘Then come up,’ said carrier lazy horse; came accordingly. Having time cried much I possibly could, I began think use crying more, especially neither Roderick Random, Captain Royal British Navy, ever cried, I could remember, trying situations. The carrier, seeing resolution, proposed pocket-handkerchief spread upon horse’s back dry. I thanked him, assented; particularly small looked, circumstances. I leisure examine purse. It stiff leather purse, snap, three bright shillings it, Peggotty evidently polished whitening, greater delight. But precious contents two half-crowns folded together bit paper, written, mother’s hand, ‘For Davy. With love.’ I overcome this, I asked carrier good reach pocket-handkerchief again; he said he thought I better without it, I thought I really had, I wiped eyes sleeve stopped myself. For good, too; though, consequence previous emotions, I still occasionally seized stormy sob. After jogged little time, I asked carrier he going way. ‘All way where?’ inquired carrier. ‘There,’ I said. ‘Where is there?’ inquired carrier. ‘Near London,’ I said. ‘Why horse,’ said carrier, jerking rein point out, ‘would deader pork afore he got half ground.’ ‘Are going Yarmouth then?’ I asked. ‘That is it,’ said carrier. ‘And I shall take stage-cutch, stage-cutch that will take to--wherever is.’ As great deal carrier (whose name Mr. Barkis) say--he being, I observed former chapter, phlegmatic temperament, conversational--I offered cake mark attention, he ate one gulp, exactly like elephant, made impression his big face would done elephant’s. ‘Did SHE make ‘them, now?’ said Mr. Barkis, always leaning forward, his slouching way, footboard cart arm knee. ‘Peggotty, mean, sir?’ ‘Ah!’ said Mr. Barkis. ‘Her.’ ‘Yes. She makes pastry, cooking.’ ‘Do she though?’ said Mr. Barkis. He made his mouth whistle, he did not whistle. He sat looking horse’s ears, he saw something new there; sat so, considerable time. By by, he said: ‘No sweethearts, I b’lieve?’ ‘Sweetmeats say, Mr. Barkis?’ For I thought he wanted something else eat, pointedly alluded description refreshment. ‘Hearts,’ said Mr. Barkis. ‘Sweet hearts; person walks her!’ ‘With Peggotty?’ ‘Ah!’ he said. ‘Her.’ ‘Oh, no. She never sweetheart.’ ‘Did not she, though!’ said Mr. Barkis. Again he made his mouth whistle, he did not whistle, sat looking horse’s ears. ‘So she makes,’ said Mr. Barkis, long interval reflection, ‘all apple parsties, doos cooking, she?’ I replied fact. ‘Well. I will tell what,’ said Mr. Barkis. ‘P’raps might writin’ her?’ ‘I shall certainly write her,’ I rejoined. ‘Ah!’ he said, slowly turning his eyes towards me. ‘Well! If writin’ her, p’raps you would recollect say Barkis willin’; would you?’ ‘That Barkis willing,’ I repeated, innocently. ‘Is message?’ ‘Ye-es,’ he said, considering. ‘Ye-es. Barkis willin’.’ ‘But Blunderstone tomorrow, Mr. Barkis,’ I said, faltering little idea far away then, could give message much better.’ As he repudiated suggestion, however, jerk his head, confirmed his previous request saying, profound gravity, ‘Barkis willin’. That is message,’ I readily undertook transmission. While I waiting coach hotel Yarmouth afternoon, I procured sheet paper inkstand, wrote note Peggotty, ran thus: ‘My dear Peggotty. I come safe. Barkis willing. My love mama. Yours affectionately. P.S. He says he particularly wants know--BARKIS IS WILLING.’ When I taken commission prospectively, Mr. Barkis relapsed perfect silence; I, feeling quite worn happened lately, lay sack cart fell asleep. I slept soundly got Yarmouth; entirely new strange inn-yard drove, I abandoned latent hope I meeting Mr. Peggotty’s family there, perhaps even little Them’ly herself. The coach yard, shining much over, without horses yet; looked state nothing unlikely ever going London. I thinking this, wondering would ultimately become box, Mr. Barkis put yard-pavement pole (he driven yard turn his cart), also would ultimately become me, lady looked bow-window fowls joints meat hanging up, said: ‘Is little gentleman Blunderstone?’ ‘Yes, madam,’ I said. ‘What name?’ inquired lady. ‘Copperfield, madam,’ I said. ‘That will not do,’ returned lady. ‘Nobody’s dinner paid here, name.’ ‘Is Murdstone, madam?’ I said. ‘If you are Master Murdstone,’ said lady, ‘why go give another name, first?’ I explained lady was, rang bell, called out, ‘William! show coffee-room!’ upon waiter came running kitchen opposite side yard show it, seemed good deal surprised he show me. It large long room large maps it. I doubt I could felt much stranger maps real foreign countries, I cast away middle them. I felt taking liberty sit down, cap hand, corner chair nearest door; waiter laid cloth purpose me, put set castors it, I think I must turned red modesty. He brought chops, vegetables, took covers bouncing manner I afraid I must given offence. But he greatly relieved mind putting chair table, saying, affably, ‘Now, six-foot! come on!’ I thanked him, took seat board; found extremely difficult handle knife fork anything like dexterity, avoid splashing gravy, he standing opposite, staring hard, making blush dreadful manner every time I caught his eye. After watching second chop, he said: ‘There is half pint ale you. Will now?’ I thanked said, ‘Yes.’ Upon he poured jug large tumbler, held light, made look beautiful. ‘My eye!’ he said. ‘It seems good deal, do not it?’ ‘It seem good deal,’ I answered smile. For quite delightful me, find pleasant. He twinkling-eyed, pimple-faced man, his hair standing upright his head; he stood one arm a-kimbo, holding glass light hand, he looked quite friendly. ‘There gentleman here, yesterday,’ he said--‘a stout gentleman, name Topsawyer--perhaps know him?’ ‘No,’ I said, ‘I do not think--’ ‘In breeches gaiters, broad-brimmed hat, grey coat, speckled choker,’ said waiter. ‘No,’ I said bashfully, ‘I have not pleasure--’ ‘He came here,’ said waiter, looking light tumbler, ‘ordered glass ale--WOULD order it--I told not--drank it, fell dead. It old him. It ought not drawn; that is fact.’ I much shocked hear melancholy accident, said I thought I better water. ‘Why see,’ said waiter, still looking light tumbler, one his eyes shut up, ‘our people do not like things ordered left. It offends ‘them. But I will drink it, like. I am used it, use everything. I do not think it will hurt me, I throw head back, take quick. Shall I?’ I replied he would much oblige drinking it, he thought he could safely, means otherwise. When he throw his head back, take quick, I horrible fear, I confess, seeing meet fate lamented Mr. Topsawyer, fall lifeless carpet. But did not hurt him. On contrary, I thought he seemed fresher it. ‘What got here?’ he said, putting fork dish. ‘Not chops?’ ‘Chops,’ I said. ‘Lord bless soul!’ he exclaimed, ‘I did not know chops. Why, chop’s thing take bad effects beer! Are not lucky?’ So he took chop bone one hand, potato other, ate away good appetite, extreme satisfaction. He afterwards took another chop, another potato; that, another chop another potato. When done, he brought pudding, set me, seemed ruminate, become absent his mind moments. ‘How is pie?’ he said, rousing himself. ‘It is pudding,’ I made answer. ‘Pudding!’ he exclaimed. ‘Why, bless me, is! What!’ looking nearer. ‘You do not mean say it is batter-pudding!’ ‘Yes, indeed.’ ‘Why, batter-pudding,’ he said, taking table-spoon, ‘is favourite pudding! Are not lucky? Come on, little ‘un, let us see who will get most.’ The waiter certainly got most. He entreated come win, his table-spoon tea-spoon, his dispatch dispatch, his appetite appetite, I left far behind first mouthful, chance him. I never saw anyone enjoy pudding much, I think; he laughed, gone, his enjoyment lasted still. Finding friendly companionable, I asked pen ink paper, write Peggotty. He brought immediately, good enough look I wrote letter. When I finished it, he asked I going school. I said, ‘Near London,’ I knew. ‘Oh! eye!’ he said, looking low-spirited, ‘I sorry that.’ ‘Why?’ I asked him. ‘Oh, Lord!’ he said, shaking his head, ‘that is school broke boy’s ribs--two ribs--a little boy he was. I say he was--let see--how old you, about?’ I told eight nine. ‘That is his age,’ he said. ‘He eight years six months old broke his first rib; eight years eight months old broke his second, him.’ I could disguise myself, waiter, uncomfortable coincidence, inquired done. His answer cheering spirits, consisted two dismal words, ‘With whopping.’ The blowing coach-horn yard seasonable diversion, made get hesitatingly inquire, mingled pride diffidence purse (which I took pocket), anything pay. ‘There is sheet letter-paper,’ he returned. ‘Did ever buy sheet letter-paper?’ I could remember I ever had. ‘It is dear,’ he said, ‘on account duty. Threepence. That is way we are taxed country. There is nothing else, except waiter. Never mind ink. I lose that.’ ‘What you--what I--how much ought I to--what would right pay waiter, please?’ I stammered, blushing. ‘If I had not family, family had not cowpock,’ said waiter, ‘I would not take sixpence. If I did not support aged pairint, lovely sister,’--here waiter greatly agitated--‘I would not take farthing. If I good place, treated well here, I beg acceptance trifle, instead taking it. But I live broken wittles--and I sleep coals’--here waiter burst tears. I much concerned his misfortunes, felt recognition short ninepence would mere brutality hardness heart. Therefore I gave one three bright shillings, he received much humility veneration, spun his thumb, directly afterwards, try goodness of. It little disconcerting me, find, I helped behind coach, I supposed eaten dinner without assistance. I discovered this, overhearing lady bow-window say guard, ‘Take care child, George, he will burst!’ observing women-servants place came look giggle young phenomenon. My unfortunate friend waiter, quite recovered his spirits, appear disturbed this, joined general admiration without confused. If I doubt him, I suppose half awakened it; I inclined believe simple confidence child, natural reliance child upon superior years (qualities I sorry children prematurely change worldly wisdom), I serious mistrust whole, even then. I felt rather hard, I must own, made, without deserving it, subject jokes coachman guard coach drawing heavy behind, account sitting there, greater expediency travelling waggon. The story supposed appetite getting wind among outside passengers, merry upon likewise; asked whether I going paid for, school, two brothers three, whether I contracted for, went upon regular terms; pleasant questions. But worst was, I knew I ashamed eat anything, opportunity offered, that, rather light dinner, I remain hungry night--for I left cakes behind, hotel, hurry. My apprehensions realized. When stopped supper I could not muster courage take any, though I liked much, sat fire said I did not want anything. This save jokes, either; husky-voiced gentleman rough face, eating sandwich-box nearly way, except he drinking bottle, said I like boa-constrictor took enough one meal last long time; which, he actually brought rash upon boiled beef. We started Yarmouth three of the clock afternoon, due London eight next morning. It Mid-summer weather, evening pleasant. When passed village, I pictured insides houses like, inhabitants about; boys came running us, got behind swung little way, I wondered whether fathers alive, whether happy home. I plenty think of, therefore, besides mind running continually kind place I going to--which awful speculation. Sometimes, I remember, I resigned thoughts home Peggotty; endeavouring, confused blind way, recall I felt, sort boy I used be, I bit Mr. Murdstone: I could not satisfy means, I seemed bitten remote antiquity. The night pleasant evening, got chilly; put two gentlemen (the rough-faced one another) prevent tumbling coach, I nearly smothered falling asleep, completely blocking up. They squeezed hard sometimes, I could help crying out, ‘Oh! If please!’--which did not like all, woke them. Opposite elderly lady great fur cloak, looked dark like haystack lady, she wrapped degree. This lady basket her, she had not known it, long time, she found account legs short, could go underneath me. It cramped hurt so, made perfectly miserable; I moved least, made glass basket rattle something else (as sure do), she gave cruellest poke her foot, said, ‘Come, do not YOU fidget. YOUR bones young enough, I am sure!’ At last sun rose, companions seemed sleep easier. The difficulties laboured night, found utterance terrific gasps snorts, conceived. As sun got higher, sleep became lighter, gradually one one awoke. I recollect much surprised feint everybody made, then, sleep all, uncommon indignation everyone repelled charge. I labour kind astonishment day, invariably observed human weaknesses, one common nature least disposed confess (I cannot imagine why) weakness gone sleep coach. What amazing place London I saw distance, I believed adventures favourite heroes constantly enacting re-enacting there, I vaguely made mind fuller wonders wickedness cities earth, I need stop relate. We approached degrees, got, due time, inn Whitechapel district, bound. I forget whether Blue Bull, Blue Boar; I know Blue Something, likeness painted back coach. The guard’s eye lighted he getting down, he said booking-office door: ‘Is anybody yoongster booked name Murdstone, Bloonderstone, Sooffolk, left till called for?’ Nobody answered. ‘Try Copperfield, please, sir,’ said I, looking helplessly down. ‘Is anybody yoongster, booked name Murdstone, Bloonderstone, Sooffolk, owning name Copperfield, left till called for?’ said guard. ‘Come! IS anybody?’ No. There nobody. I looked anxiously around; inquiry made impression bystanders, I except man gaiters, one eye, suggested better put brass collar round neck, tie stable. A ladder brought, I got lady, like haystack: daring stir, her basket removed. The coach clear passengers time, luggage soon cleared out, horses taken luggage, coach wheeled backed hostlers, way. Still, nobody appeared, claim dusty youngster Blunderstone, Suffolk. More solitary Robinson Crusoe, nobody look see he solitary, I went booking-office, and, invitation clerk duty, passed behind counter, sat scale weighed luggage. Here, I sat looking parcels, packages, books, inhaling smell stables (ever since associated morning), procession tremendous considerations began march mind. Supposing nobody ever fetch me, long would consent keep there? Would keep long enough spend seven shillings? Should I sleep night one wooden bins, luggage, wash pump yard morning; I turned every night, expected come left till called for, office opened next day? Supposing mistake case, Mr. Murdstone devised plan get rid me, I do? If allowed remain seven shillings spent, I could not hope remain I began starve. That would obviously inconvenient unpleasant customers, besides entailing Blue Whatever-it-was, risk funeral expenses. If I started once, tried walk back home, could I ever find way, could I ever hope walk far, could I make sure anyone Peggotty, even I got back? If I found nearest proper authorities, offered go soldier, sailor, I little fellow likely would not take in. These thoughts, hundred thoughts, turned burning hot, made giddy apprehension dismay. I height fever man entered whispered clerk, presently slanted scale, pushed him, I weighed, bought, delivered, paid for. As I went office, hand hand new acquaintance, I stole look him. He gaunt, sallow young man, hollow cheeks, chin almost black Mr. Murdstone’s; likeness ended, his whiskers shaved off, his hair, instead glossy, rusty dry. He dressed suit black clothes rather rusty dry too, rather short sleeves legs; he white neck-kerchief on, over-clean. I not, not, suppose neck-kerchief linen he wore, he showed gave hint of. ‘You are new boy?’ he said. ‘Yes, sir,’ I said. I supposed I was. I did not know. ‘I am one masters Salem House,’ he said. I made bow felt much overawed. I ashamed allude commonplace thing like box, scholar master Salem House, gone little distance yard I hardihood mention it. We turned back, humbly insinuating might useful hereafter; he told clerk carrier instructions call noon. ‘If please, sir,’ I said, accomplished distance before, ‘is far?’ ‘It is Blackheath,’ he said. ‘Is far, sir?’ I diffidently asked. ‘It is good step,’ he said. ‘We shall go stage-coach. It is six miles.’ I faint tired, idea holding six miles more, much me. I took heart tell I nothing night, he would allow buy something eat, I much obliged him. He appeared surprised this--I see stop look now--and considering moments, said he wanted call old person lived far off, best way would buy bread, whatever I liked best wholesome, make breakfast her house, could get milk. Accordingly looked baker’s window, I made series proposals buy everything bilious shop, he rejected one one, decided favour nice little loaf brown bread, cost threepence. Then, grocer’s shop, bought egg slice streaky bacon; still left I thought good deal change, second bright shillings, made consider London cheap place. These provisions laid in, went great noise uproar confused weary head beyond description, bridge which, doubt, London Bridge (indeed I think he told so, I half asleep), came poor person’s house, part alms-houses, I knew look, inscription stone gate said established twenty-five poor women. The Master Salem House lifted latch one number little black doors alike, little diamond-paned window one side, another little diamond--paned window above; went little house one poor old women, blowing fire make little saucepan boil. On seeing master enter, old woman stopped bellows her knee, said something I thought sounded like ‘My Charley!’ seeing come too, she got up, rubbing her hands made confused sort half curtsey. ‘Can cook young gentleman’s breakfast him, please?’ said Master Salem House. ‘Can I?’ said old woman. ‘Yes I, sure!’ ‘How is Mrs. Fibbitson today?’ said Master, looking another old woman large chair fire, bundle clothes I feel grateful hour sat upon her mistake. ‘Ah, she is poorly,’ said first old woman. ‘It is one her bad days. If fire go out, accident, I verily believe she would go too, never come life again.’ As looked her, I looked her also. Although warm day, she seemed think nothing fire. I fancied she jealous even saucepan it; I reason know she took impressment service boiling egg broiling bacon, dudgeon; I saw her, discomfited eyes, shake her fist once, culinary operations going on, one else looking. The sun streamed little window, she sat her back back large chair towards it, screening fire she sedulously keeping IT warm, instead keeping her warm, watching distrustful manner. The completion preparations breakfast, relieving fire, gave her extreme joy she laughed aloud--and unmelodious laugh she had, I must say. I sat brown loaf, egg, rasher bacon, basin milk besides, made delicious meal. While I yet full enjoyment it, old woman house said Master: ‘Have got flute you?’ ‘Yes,’ he returned. ‘Have blow it,’ said old woman, coaxingly. ‘Do!’ The Master, upon this, put his hand underneath skirts his coat, brought his flute three pieces, he screwed together, began immediately play. My impression is, many years consideration, never anybody world played worse. He made dismal sounds I ever heard produced means, natural artificial. I do not know tunes were--if things performance all, I doubt--but influence strain upon was, first, make think sorrows I could hardly keep tears back; take away appetite; lastly, make sleepy I could not keep eyes open. They begin close again, I begin nod, recollection rises fresh upon me. Once little room, open corner cupboard, square-backed chairs, angular little staircase leading room above, three peacock’s feathers displayed mantelpiece--I remember wondering I first went in, peacock would thought he known his finery doomed come to--fades me, I nod, sleep. The flute becomes inaudible, wheels coach heard instead, I journey. The coach jolts, I wake start, flute come back again, Master Salem House sitting his legs crossed, playing dolefully, old woman house looks delighted. She fades her turn, he fades, fades, flute, Master, Salem House, David Copperfield, anything heavy sleep. I dreamed, I thought, he blowing dismal flute, old woman house, gone nearer nearer her ecstatic admiration, leaned back his chair gave affectionate squeeze round neck, stopped his playing moment. I middle state sleeping waking, either immediately afterwards; for, he resumed--it real fact he stopped playing--I saw heard old woman ask Mrs. Fibbitson was not delicious (meaning flute), Mrs. Fibbitson replied, ‘Ay, ay! yes!’ nodded fire: which, I persuaded, she gave credit whole performance. When I seemed dozing long while, Master Salem House unscrewed his flute three pieces, put before, took away. We found coach near hand, got upon roof; I dead sleepy, stopped road take somebody else, put inside passengers, I slept profoundly, I found coach going footpace steep hill among green leaves. Presently, stopped, come destination. A short walk brought us--I mean Master me--to Salem House, enclosed high brick wall, looked dull. Over door wall board SALEM HOUSE upon it; grating door surveyed rang bell surly face, I found, door opened, belonged stout man bull-neck, wooden leg, overhanging temples, his hair cut close round his head. ‘The new boy,’ said Master. The man wooden leg eyed over--it did not take long, much me--and locked gate behind us, took key. We going house, among dark heavy trees, he called conductor. ‘Hallo!’ We looked back, he standing door little lodge, he lived, pair boots his hand. ‘Here! The cobbler’s been,’ he said, ‘since you have out, Mr. Mell, he says he cannot mend ‘them more. He says are not bit original boot left, he wonders expect it.’ With words he threw boots towards Mr. Mell, went back paces pick up, looked (very disconsolately, I afraid), went together. I observed then, first time, boots he good deal worse wear, his stocking breaking one place, like bud. Salem House square brick building wings; bare unfurnished appearance. All quiet, I said Mr. Mell I supposed boys out; he seemed surprised knowing holiday-time. That boys several homes. That Mr. Creakle, proprietor, sea-side Mrs. Miss Creakle; I sent holiday-time punishment misdoing, he explained went along. I gazed upon schoolroom he took me, forlorn desolate place I ever seen. I see now. A long room three long rows desks, six forms, bristling round pegs hats slates. Scraps old copy-books exercises litter dirty floor. Some silkworms’ houses, made materials, scattered desks. Two miserable little white mice, left behind owner, running fusty castle made pasteboard wire, looking corners red eyes anything eat. A bird, cage little bigger himself, makes mournful rattle hopping his perch, two inches high, dropping it; neither sings chirps. There strange unwholesome smell upon room, like mildewed corduroys, sweet apples wanting air, rotten books. There could well ink splashed it, roofless first construction, skies rained, snowed, hailed, blown ink varying seasons year. Mr. Mell left he took his irreparable boots upstairs, I went softly upper end room, observing I crept along. Suddenly I came upon pasteboard placard, beautifully written, lying desk, bore words: ‘TAKE CARE OF HIM. HE BITES.’ I got upon desk immediately, apprehensive least great dog underneath. But, though I looked round anxious eyes, I could see nothing him. I still engaged peering about, Mr. Mell came back, asked I there? ‘I beg pardon, sir,’ says I, ‘if please, I am looking dog.’ ‘Dog?’ he says. ‘What dog?’ ‘Is not dog, sir?’ ‘Is not dog?’ ‘That is taken care of, sir; bites.’ ‘No, Copperfield,’ says he, gravely, ‘that is dog. That is boy. My instructions are, Copperfield, put placard back. I sorry make beginning you, I must it.’ With he took down, tied placard, neatly constructed purpose, shoulders like knapsack; wherever I went, afterwards, I consolation carrying it. What I suffered placard, nobody imagine. Whether possible people see not, I always fancied somebody reading it. It relief turn round find nobody; wherever back was, I imagined somebody always be. That cruel man wooden leg aggravated sufferings. He authority; he ever saw leaning tree, wall, house, he roared his lodge door stupendous voice, ‘Hallo, sir! You Copperfield! Show badge conspicuous, I will report you!’ The playground bare gravelled yard, open back house offices; I knew servants read it, butcher read it, baker read it; everybody, word, came backwards forwards house, morning I ordered walk there, read I taken care of, I bit, I recollect I positively began dread myself, kind wild boy bite. There old door playground, boys custom carving names. It completely covered inscriptions. In dread end vacation coming back, I could read boy’s name, without inquiring tone emphasis HE would read, ‘Take care him. He bites.’ There one boy--a certain J. Steerforth--who cut his name deep often, who, I conceived, would read rather strong voice, afterwards pull hair. There another boy, one Tommy Traddles, I dreaded would make game it, pretend dreadfully frightened me. There third, George Demple, I fancied would sing it. I looked, little shrinking creature, door, owners names--there five-and-forty school then, Mr. Mell said--seemed send Coventry general acclamation, cry out, his way, ‘Take care him. He bites!’ It places desks forms. It groves deserted bedsteads I peeped at, way to, I in, bed. I remember dreaming night night, mother she used be, going party Mr. Peggotty’s, travelling outside stage-coach, dining unfortunate friend waiter, circumstances making people scream stare, unhappy disclosure I nothing little night-shirt, placard. In monotony life, constant apprehension re-opening school, insupportable affliction! I long tasks every day Mr. Mell; I them, Mr. Miss Murdstone here, got without disgrace. Before, them, I walked about--supervised, I mentioned, man wooden leg. How vividly I call mind damp house, green cracked flagstones court, old leaky water-butt, discoloured trunks grim trees, seemed dripped rain trees, blown less sun! At one dined, Mr. Mell I, upper end long bare dining-room, full deal tables, smelling fat. Then, tasks tea, Mr. Mell drank blue teacup, I tin pot. All day long, seven eight evening, Mr. Mell, his detached desk schoolroom, worked hard pen, ink, ruler, books, writing-paper, making bills (as I found) last half-year. When he put his things night he took his flute, blew it, I almost thought he would gradually blow his whole large hole top, ooze away keys. I picture small self dimly-lighted rooms, sitting head upon hand, listening doleful performance Mr. Mell, conning tomorrow’s lessons. I picture books shut up, still listening doleful performance Mr. Mell, listening used home, blowing wind Yarmouth flats, feeling sad solitary. I picture going bed, among unused rooms, sitting bed-side crying comfortable word Peggotty. I picture coming downstairs morning, looking long ghastly gash staircase window school-bell hanging top out-house weathercock it; dreading time shall ring J. Steerforth rest work: second, foreboding apprehensions, time man wooden leg shall unlock rusty gate give admission awful Mr. Creakle. I cannot think I dangerous character aspects, I carried warning back. Mr. Mell never said much me, he never harsh me. I suppose company other, without talking. I forgot mention he would talk sometimes, grin, clench his fist, grind his teeth, pull his hair unaccountable manner. But he peculiarities: first frightened me, though I soon got used them. CHAPTER 6. I ENLARGE MY CIRCLE OF ACQUAINTANCE I HAD led life month, man wooden leg began stump mop bucket water, I inferred preparations making receive Mr. Creakle boys. I mistaken; mop came schoolroom long, turned Mr. Mell me, lived could, got could, days, always way two three young women, rarely shown before, continually midst dust I sneezed almost much Salem House great snuff-box. One day I informed Mr. Mell Mr. Creakle would home evening. In evening, tea, I heard he come. Before bedtime, I fetched man wooden leg appear him. Mr. Creakle’s part house good deal comfortable ours, he snug bit garden looked pleasant dusty playground, desert miniature, I thought one camel, dromedary, could felt home it. It seemed bold thing even take notice passage looked comfortable, I went way, trembling, Mr. Creakle’s presence: abashed me, I ushered it, I hardly saw Mrs. Creakle Miss Creakle (who there, parlour), anything Mr. Creakle, stout gentleman bunch watch-chain seals, arm-chair, tumbler bottle beside him. ‘So!’ said Mr. Creakle. ‘This young gentleman whose teeth filed! Turn round.’ The wooden-legged man turned exhibit placard; afforded time full survey it, turned again, face Mr. Creakle, posted Mr. Creakle’s side. Mr. Creakle’s face fiery, his eyes small, deep his head; he thick veins his forehead, little nose, large chin. He bald top his head; thin wet-looking hair turning grey, brushed across temple, two sides interlaced his forehead. But circumstance impressed most, was, he voice, spoke whisper. The exertion cost him, consciousness talking feeble way, made his angry face much angry, his thick veins much thicker, he spoke, I surprised, looking back, peculiarity striking his chief one. ‘Now,’ said Mr. Creakle. ‘What is report boy?’ ‘There is nothing yet,’ returned man wooden leg. ‘There opportunity.’ I thought Mr. Creakle disappointed. I thought Mrs. Miss Creakle (at I glanced first time, were, both, thin quiet) disappointed. ‘Come here, sir!’ said Mr. Creakle, beckoning me. ‘Come here!’ said man wooden leg, repeating gesture. ‘I happiness knowing father-in-law,’ whispered Mr. Creakle, taking ear; ‘and worthy man he is, man strong character. He knows me, I know him. Do YOU know me? Hey?’ said Mr. Creakle, pinching ear ferocious playfulness. ‘Not yet, sir,’ I said, flinching pain. ‘Not yet? Hey?’ repeated Mr. Creakle. ‘But soon. Hey?’ ‘You soon. Hey?’ repeated man wooden leg. I afterwards found he generally acted, his strong voice, Mr. Creakle’s interpreter boys. I much frightened, said, I hoped so, he pleased. I felt, while, ear blazing; he pinched hard. ‘I will tell I am,’ whispered Mr. Creakle, letting go last, screw parting brought water eyes. ‘I am Tartar.’ ‘A Tartar,’ said man wooden leg. ‘When I say I will thing, I it,’ said Mr. Creakle; ‘and I say I thing done, I done.’ ‘--Will thing done, I done,’ repeated man wooden leg. ‘I determined character,’ said Mr. Creakle. ‘That is I am. I duty. That is I do. My flesh blood’--he looked Mrs. Creakle he said this--‘when rises me, flesh blood. I discard it. Has fellow’--to man wooden leg--‘been again?’ ‘No,’ answer. ‘No,’ said Mr. Creakle. ‘He knows better. He knows me. Let keep away. I say let keep away,’ said Mr. Creakle, striking his hand upon table, looking Mrs. Creakle, ‘for he knows me. Now begun know too, young friend, may go. Take away.’ I glad ordered away, Mrs. Miss Creakle wiping eyes, I felt uncomfortable I myself. But I petition mind concerned nearly, I could not help saying, though I wondered courage: ‘If please, sir--’ Mr. Creakle whispered, ‘Hah! What is this?’ bent his eyes upon me, he would burnt them. ‘If please, sir,’ I faltered, ‘if I might allowed (I sorry indeed, sir, I did) take writing off, boys come back--’ Whether Mr. Creakle earnest, whether he frighten me, I do not know, he made burst his chair, I precipitately retreated, without waiting escort man wooden leg, never stopped I reached bedroom, where, finding I pursued, I went bed, time, lay quaking, couple hours. Next morning Mr. Sharp came back. Mr. Sharp first master, superior Mr. Mell. Mr. Mell took his meals boys, Mr. Sharp dined supped Mr. Creakle’s table. He limp, delicate-looking gentleman, I thought, good deal nose, way carrying his head one side, little heavy him. His hair smooth wavy; I informed first boy came back wig (a second-hand one HE said), Mr. Sharp went every Saturday afternoon get curled. It Tommy Traddles gave piece intelligence. He first boy returned. He introduced informing I find his name right-hand corner gate, top-bolt; upon I said, ‘Traddles?’ he replied, ‘The same,’ he asked full account family. It happy circumstance Traddles came back first. He enjoyed placard much, he saved embarrassment either disclosure concealment, presenting every boy came back, great small, immediately his arrival, form introduction, ‘Look here! Here is game!’ Happily, too, greater part boys came back low-spirited, boisterous expense I expected. Some certainly dance like wild Indians, greater part could resist temptation pretending I dog, patting soothing me, lest I bite, saying, ‘Lie down, sir!’ calling Towzer. This naturally confusing, among many strangers, cost tears, whole much better I anticipated. I considered formally received school, however, J. Steerforth arrived. Before boy, reputed great scholar, good-looking, least half-a-dozen years senior, I carried magistrate. He inquired, she would playground, particulars punishment, pleased express his opinion ‘a jolly shame’; I became bound ever afterwards. ‘What money got, Copperfield?’ he said, walking aside he disposed affair terms. I told seven shillings. ‘You better give take care of,’ he said. ‘At least, like. You need not do not like.’ I hastened comply his friendly suggestion, opening Peggotty’s purse, turned upside his hand. ‘Do want spend anything now?’ he asked me. ‘No thank you,’ I replied. ‘You can, like, know,’ said Steerforth. ‘Say word.’ ‘No, thank you, sir,’ I repeated. ‘Perhaps you would like spend couple shillings so, bottle currant wine by, bedroom?’ said Steerforth. ‘You belong bedroom, I find.’ It certainly occurred before, I said, Yes, I like that. ‘Very good,’ said Steerforth. ‘You will glad spend another shilling so, almond cakes, I dare say?’ I said, Yes, I like that, too. ‘And another shilling biscuits, another fruit, eh?’ said Steerforth. ‘I say, young Copperfield, you are going it!’ I smiled he smiled, I little troubled mind, too. ‘Well!’ said Steerforth. ‘We must make stretch far can; that is all. I will best power you. I go I like, I will smuggle prog in.’ With words he put money his pocket, kindly told make uneasy; he would take care right. He good his word, right I secret misgiving nearly wrong--for I feared waste mother’s two half-crowns--though I preserved piece paper wrapped in: precious saving. When went upstairs bed, he produced whole seven shillings’ worth, laid bed moonlight, saying: ‘There are, young Copperfield, royal spread you have got.’ I could not think honours feast, time life, he by; hand shook thought it. I begged favour presiding; request seconded boys room, he acceded it, sat upon pillow, handing round viands--with perfect fairness, I must say--and dispensing currant wine little glass without foot, his property. As me, I sat his left hand, rest grouped us, nearest beds floor. How well I recollect sitting there, talking whispers; talking, respectfully listening, I ought rather say; moonlight falling little way room, window, painting pale window floor, greater part us shadow, except Steerforth dipped match phosphorus-box, he wanted look anything board, she would blue glare us gone directly! A certain mysterious feeling, consequent darkness, secrecy revel, whisper everything said, steals again, I listen tell vague feeling solemnity awe, makes glad near, frightens (though I feign laugh) Traddles pretends see ghost corner. I heard kinds things school belonging it. I heard Mr. Creakle preferred his claim Tartar without reason; he sternest severe masters; he laid him, right left, every day his life, charging among boys like trooper, slashing away, unmercifully. That he knew nothing himself, art slashing, ignorant (J. Steerforth said) lowest boy school; he been, good many years ago, small hop-dealer Borough, taken schooling business bankrupt hops, making away Mrs. Creakle’s money. With good deal sort, I wondered knew. I heard man wooden leg, whose name Tungay, obstinate barbarian formerly assisted hop business, come scholastic line Mr. Creakle, consequence, supposed among boys, his broken his leg Mr. Creakle’s service, done deal dishonest work him, knowing his secrets. I heard single exception Mr. Creakle, Tungay considered whole establishment, masters boys, his natural enemies, delight his life sour malicious. I heard Mr. Creakle son, Tungay’s friend, who, assisting school, held remonstrance his father occasion discipline cruelly exercised, supposed, besides, protested his father’s usage his mother. I heard Mr. Creakle turned doors, consequence; Mrs. Miss Creakle sad way, ever since. But greatest wonder I heard Mr. Creakle was, one boy school he never ventured lay hand, boy J. Steerforth. Steerforth confirmed stated, said he like begin see it. On asked mild boy (not me) he would proceed he begin see it, he dipped match his phosphorus-box purpose she would glare his reply, said he would commence knocking blow forehead seven-and-sixpenny ink-bottle always mantelpiece. We sat dark time, breathless. I heard Mr. Sharp Mr. Mell supposed wretchedly paid; hot cold meat dinner Mr. Creakle’s table, Mr. Sharp always expected say he preferred cold; corroborated J. Steerforth, parlour-boarder. I heard Mr. Sharp’s wig did not fit him; he need not ‘bounceable’--somebody else said ‘bumptious’--about it, his red hair plainly seen behind. I heard one boy, coal-merchant’s son, came set-off coal-bill, called, account, ‘Exchange Barter’--a name selected arithmetic book expressing arrangement. I heard table beer robbery parents, pudding imposition. I heard Miss Creakle regarded school general love Steerforth; I sure, I sat dark, thinking his nice voice, his fine face, his easy manner, his curling hair, I thought likely. I heard Mr. Mell bad sort fellow, had not sixpence bless with; doubt old Mrs. Mell, his mother, poor job. I thought breakfast then, sounded like ‘My Charley!’ I was, I glad remember, mute mouse it. The hearing this, good deal more, outlasted banquet time. The greater part guests gone bed soon eating drinking over; we, remained whispering listening half-undressed, last betook bed, too. ‘Good night, young Copperfield,’ said Steerforth. ‘I will take care you.’ ‘You are kind,’ I gratefully returned. ‘I much obliged you.’ ‘You have not got sister, you?’ said Steerforth, yawning. ‘No,’ I answered. ‘That is pity,’ said Steerforth. ‘If one, I think she would pretty, timid, little, bright-eyed sort girl. I liked know her. Good night, young Copperfield.’ ‘Good night, sir,’ I replied. I thought much I went bed, raised myself, I recollect, look he lay moonlight, his handsome face turned up, his head reclining easily his arm. He person great power eyes; was, course, reason mind running him. No veiled future dimly glanced upon moonbeams. There shadowy picture his footsteps, garden I dreamed walking night. CHAPTER 7. MY ‘FIRST HALF’ AT SALEM HOUSE School began earnest next day. A profound impression made upon me, I remember, roar voices schoolroom suddenly becoming hushed death Mr. Creakle entered breakfast, stood doorway looking round upon us like giant story-book surveying his captives. Tungay stood Mr. Creakle’s elbow. He occasion, I thought, cry ‘Silence!’ ferociously, boys struck speechless motionless. Mr. Creakle seen speak, Tungay heard, effect. ‘Now, boys, new half. Take care you are about, new half. Come fresh lessons, I advise you, I come fresh punishment. I will not flinch. It use rubbing yourselves; will not rub marks I shall give you. Now get work, every boy!’ When dreadful exordium over, Tungay stumped again, Mr. Creakle came I sat, told I famous biting, he famous biting, too. He showed cane, asked I thought THAT, tooth? Was sharp tooth, hey? Was double tooth, hey? Had deep prong, hey? Did bite, hey? Did bite? At every question he gave fleshy cut made writhe; I soon made free Salem House (as Steerforth said), soon tears also. Not I mean say special marks distinction, I received. On contrary, large majority boys (especially smaller ones) visited similar instances notice, Mr. Creakle made round schoolroom. Half establishment writhing crying, day’s work began; much writhed cried day’s work over, I really afraid recollect, lest I seem exaggerate. I think never man enjoyed his profession Mr. Creakle did. He delight cutting boys, like satisfaction craving appetite. I confident he could not resist chubby boy, especially; fascination subject, made restless his mind, he scored marked day. I chubby myself, ought know. I sure I think fellow now, blood rises disinterested indignation I feel I could known without ever his power; rises hotly, I know incapable brute, right possessed great trust he held, Lord High Admiral, Commander-in-Chief--in either capacities probable he would done infinitely less mischief. Miserable little propitiators remorseless Idol, abject him! What launch life I think now, looking back, mean servile man parts pretensions! Here I sit desk again, watching his eye--humbly watching his eye, he rules ciphering-book another victim whose hands flattened identical ruler, trying wipe sting pocket-handkerchief. I plenty do. I do not watch his eye idleness, I morbidly attracted it, dread desire know he next, whether turn suffer, somebody else’s. A lane small boys beyond me, interest his eye, watch too. I think he knows it, though he pretends he do not. He makes dreadful mouths he rules ciphering-book; he throws his eye sideways lane, droop books tremble. A moment afterwards eyeing him. An unhappy culprit, found guilty imperfect exercise, approaches his command. The culprit falters excuses, professes determination better tomorrow. Mr. Creakle cuts joke he beats him, laugh it,--miserable little dogs, laugh, visages white ashes, hearts sinking boots. Here I sit desk again, drowsy summer afternoon. A buzz hum go around me, boys many bluebottles. A cloggy sensation lukewarm fat meat upon (we dined hour two ago), head heavy much lead. I would give world go sleep. I sit eye Mr. Creakle, blinking like young owl; sleep overpowers minute, he still looms slumber, ruling ciphering-books, he softly comes behind wakes plainer perception him, red ridge across back. Here I playground, eye still fascinated him, though I cannot see him. The window little distance I know he his dinner, stands him, I eye instead. If he shows his face near it, mine assumes imploring submissive expression. If he looks glass, boldest boy (Steerforth excepted) stops middle shout yell, becomes contemplative. One day, Traddles (the unfortunate boy world) breaks window accidentally, ball. I shudder moment tremendous sensation seeing done, feeling ball bounded Mr. Creakle’s sacred head. Poor Traddles! In tight sky-blue suit made his arms legs like German sausages, roly-poly puddings, he merriest miserable boys. He always caned--I think he caned every day half-year, except one holiday Monday he ruler’d hands--and always going write his uncle it, never did. After laying his head desk little while, he would cheer up, somehow, begin laugh again, draw skeletons his slate, his eyes dry. I used first wonder comfort Traddles found drawing skeletons; time looked upon sort hermit, reminded symbols mortality caning could not last ever. But I believe he easy, did not want features. He honourable, Traddles was, held solemn duty boys stand one another. He suffered several occasions; particularly once, Steerforth laughed church, Beadle thought Traddles, took out. I see now, going away custody, despised congregation. He never said real offender, though he smarted next day, imprisoned many hours he came forth whole churchyard-full skeletons swarming his Latin Dictionary. But he his reward. Steerforth said nothing sneak Traddles, felt highest praise. For part, I could gone good deal (though I much less brave Traddles, nothing like old) recompense. To see Steerforth walk church us, arm-in-arm Miss Creakle, one great sights life. I did not think Miss Creakle equal little Them’ly point beauty, I did not love her (I did not dare); I thought her young lady extraordinary attractions, point gentility surpassed. When Steerforth, white trousers, carried her parasol her, I felt proud know him; believed she could choose adore her heart. Mr. Sharp Mr. Mell notable personages eyes; Steerforth sun two stars. Steerforth continued his protection me, proved useful friend; since nobody dared annoy one he honoured his countenance. He could not--or events he did not--defend Mr. Creakle, severe me; whenever I treated worse usual, he always told I wanted little his pluck, he would not stood himself; I felt he intended encouragement, considered kind him. There one advantage, one I know of, Mr. Creakle’s severity. He found placard his way he came behind form I sat, wanted make cut passing; reason soon taken off, I saw more. An accidental circumstance cemented intimacy Steerforth me, manner inspired great pride satisfaction, though sometimes led inconvenience. It happened one occasion, he honour talking playground, I hazarded observation something somebody--I forget now--was like something somebody Peregrine Pickle. He said nothing time; I going bed night, asked I got book? I told no, explained I read it, books I made mention. ‘And recollect them?’ Steerforth said. ‘Oh yes,’ I replied; I good memory, I believed I recollected well. ‘Then I tell what, young Copperfield,’ said Steerforth, ‘you shall tell ‘them me. I cannot get sleep early night, I generally wake rather early morning. We will go ‘them one another. We will make regular Arabian Nights it.’ I felt extremely flattered arrangement, commenced carrying execution evening. What ravages I committed favourite authors course interpretation them, I condition say, unwilling know; I profound faith them, I had, best belief, simple, earnest manner narrating I narrate; qualities went long way. The drawback was, I often sleepy night, spirits indisposed resume story; rather hard work, must done; disappoint displease Steerforth course question. In morning, too, I felt weary, enjoyed another hour’s repose much, tiresome thing roused, like Sultana Scheherazade, forced long story getting-up bell rang; Steerforth resolute; he explained me, return, sums exercises, anything tasks hard me, I loser transaction. Let justice, however. I moved interested selfish motive, I moved fear him. I admired loved him, his approval return enough. It precious I look back trifles, now, aching heart. Steerforth considerate, too; showed his consideration, one particular instance, unflinching manner little tantalizing, I suspect, poor Traddles rest. Peggotty’s promised letter--what comfortable letter was!--arrived ‘the half’ many weeks old; cake perfect nest oranges, two bottles cowslip wine. This treasure, duty bound, I laid feet Steerforth, begged dispense. ‘Now, I will tell what, young Copperfield,’ said he: ‘the wine shall kept wet whistle story-telling.’ I blushed idea, begged him, modesty, think it. But he said he observed I sometimes hoarse--a little roopy his exact expression--and be, every drop, devoted purpose he mentioned. Accordingly, locked his box, drawn phial, administered piece quill cork, I supposed want restorative. Sometimes, make sovereign specific, he kind squeeze orange juice it, stir ginger, dissolve peppermint drop it; although I cannot assert flavour improved experiments, exactly compound one would chosen stomachic, last thing night first thing morning, I drank gratefully sensible his attention. We seem, me, months Peregrine, months stories. The institution never flagged want story, I certain; wine lasted almost well matter. Poor Traddles--I never think boy strange disposition laugh, tears eyes--was sort chorus, general; affected convulsed mirth comic parts, overcome fear passage alarming character narrative. This rather put out, often. It great jest his, I recollect, pretend he could not keep his teeth chattering, whenever mention made Alguazill connexion adventures Gil Blas; I remember Gil Blas met captain robbers Madrid, unlucky joker counterfeited ague terror, he overheard Mr. Creakle, prowling passage, handsomely flogged disorderly conduct bedroom. Whatever I within romantic dreamy, encouraged much story-telling dark; respect pursuit may profitable me. But cherished kind plaything room, consciousness accomplishment mine bruited among boys, attracted good deal notice though I youngest there, stimulated exertion. In school carried sheer cruelty, whether presided dunce not, likely much learnt. I believe boys were, generally, ignorant set schoolboys existence; much troubled knocked learn; could advantage, one anything advantage life constant misfortune, torment, worry. But little vanity, Steerforth’s help, urged somehow; without saving much, anything, way punishment, made me, time I there, exception general body, insomuch I steadily pick crumbs knowledge. In I much assisted Mr. Mell, liking I grateful remember. It always gave pain observe Steerforth treated systematic disparagement, seldom lost occasion wounding his feelings, inducing others so. This troubled long time, I soon told Steerforth, I could keep secret, I could keep cake tangible possession, two old women Mr. Mell taken see; I always afraid Steerforth would let out, twit it. We little thought, one us, I dare say, I ate breakfast first morning, went sleep shadow peacock’s feathers sound flute, consequences would come introduction alms-houses insignificant person. But visit unforeseen consequences; serious sort, too, way. One day Mr. Creakle kept house indisposition, naturally diffused lively joy school, good deal noise course morning’s work. The great relief satisfaction experienced boys made difficult manage; though dreaded Tungay brought his wooden leg twice thrice, took notes principal offenders’ names, great impression made it, pretty sure getting trouble tomorrow, would, thought wise, doubt, enjoy today. It was, properly, half-holiday; Saturday. But noise playground would disturbed Mr. Creakle, weather favourable going walking, ordered school afternoon, set lighter tasks usual, made occasion. It day week Mr. Sharp went get his wig curled; Mr. Mell, always drudgery, whatever was, kept school himself. If I could associate idea bull bear anyone mild Mr. Mell, I think him, connexion afternoon uproar height, one animals, baited thousand dogs. I recall bending his aching head, supported his bony hand, book his desk, wretchedly endeavouring get his tiresome work, amidst uproar might made Speaker House Commons giddy. Boys started places, playing puss corner boys; laughing boys, singing boys, talking boys, dancing boys, howling boys; boys shuffled feet, boys whirled him, grinning, making faces, mimicking behind his back his eyes; mimicking his poverty, his boots, his coat, his mother, everything belonging consideration for. ‘Silence!’ cried Mr. Mell, suddenly rising up, striking his desk book. ‘What mean! It is impossible bear it. It is maddening. How me, boys?’ It book he struck his desk with; I stood beside him, following his eye glanced round room, I saw boys stop, suddenly surprised, half afraid, sorry perhaps. Steerforth’s place bottom school, opposite end long room. He lounging his back wall, his hands his pockets, looked Mr. Mell his mouth shut he whistling, Mr. Mell looked him. ‘Silence, Mr. Steerforth!’ said Mr. Mell. ‘Silence yourself,’ said Steerforth, turning red. ‘Whom talking to?’ ‘Sit down,’ said Mr. Mell. ‘Sit yourself,’ said Steerforth, ‘and mind business.’ There titter, applause; Mr. Mell white, silence immediately succeeded; one boy, darted behind imitate his mother again, changed his mind, pretended want pen mended. ‘If think, Steerforth,’ said Mr. Mell, ‘that I acquainted power establish mind here’--he laid his hand, without considering he (as I supposed), upon head--‘or I observed you, within minutes, urging juniors every sort outrage me, mistaken.’ ‘I do not give trouble thinking you,’ said Steerforth, coolly; ‘so I am mistaken, happens.’ ‘And make use position favouritism here, sir,’ pursued Mr. Mell, his lip trembling much, ‘to insult gentleman--’ ‘A what?--where he?’ said Steerforth. Here somebody cried out, ‘Shame, J. Steerforth! Too bad!’ It Traddles; Mr. Mell instantly discomfited bidding hold his tongue. --‘To insult one fortunate life, sir, never gave least offence, many reasons insulting old enough wise enough understand,’ said Mr. Mell, his lips trembling more, ‘you commit mean base action. You sit stand please, sir. Copperfield, go on.’ ‘Young Copperfield,’ said Steerforth, coming forward room, ‘stop bit. I tell what, Mr. Mell, all. When take liberty calling mean base, anything sort, impudent beggar. You always beggar, know; that, impudent beggar.’ I clear whether he going strike Mr. Mell, Mr. Mell going strike him, intention either side. I saw rigidity come upon whole school turned stone, found Mr. Creakle midst us, Tungay his side, Mrs. Miss Creakle looking door frightened. Mr. Mell, his elbows his desk his face his hands, sat, moments, quite still. ‘Mr. Mell,’ said Mr. Creakle, shaking arm; his whisper audible now, Tungay felt unnecessary repeat his words; ‘you forgotten yourself, I hope?’ ‘No, sir, no,’ returned Master, showing his face, shaking his head, rubbing his hands great agitation. ‘No, sir. No. I remembered myself, I--no, Mr. Creakle, I forgotten myself, I--I remembered myself, sir. I--I--could wish remembered little sooner, Mr. Creakle. It--it--would kind, sir, just, sir. It would saved something, sir.’ Mr. Creakle, looking hard Mr. Mell, put his hand Tungay’s shoulder, got his feet upon form close by, sat upon desk. After still looking hard Mr. Mell his throne, he shook his head, rubbed his hands, remained state agitation, Mr. Creakle turned Steerforth, said: ‘Now, sir, he do not condescend tell me, this?’ Steerforth evaded question little while; looking scorn anger his opponent, remaining silent. I could help thinking even interval, I remember, noble fellow he appearance, homely plain Mr. Mell looked opposed him. ‘What he mean talking favourites, then?’ said Steerforth length. ‘Favourites?’ repeated Mr. Creakle, veins his forehead swelling quickly. ‘Who talked favourites?’ ‘He did,’ said Steerforth. ‘And pray, mean that, sir?’ demanded Mr. Creakle, turning angrily his assistant. ‘I meant, Mr. Creakle,’ he returned low voice, ‘as I said; pupil right avail his position favouritism degrade me.’ ‘To degrade YOU?’ said Mr. Creakle. ‘My stars! But give leave ask you, Mr. What is-your-name’; Mr. Creakle folded his arms, cane all, upon his chest, made knot his brows his little eyes hardly visible them; ‘whether, talk favourites, showed proper respect me? To me, sir,’ said Mr. Creakle, darting his head suddenly, drawing back again, ‘the principal establishment, employer.’ ‘It judicious, sir, I willing admit,’ said Mr. Mell. ‘I done so, I cool.’ Here Steerforth struck in. ‘Then he said I mean, he said I base, I called beggar. If I cool, perhaps I should not called beggar. But I did, I ready take consequences it.’ Without considering, perhaps, whether consequences taken, I felt quite glow gallant speech. It made impression boys too, low stir among them, though one spoke word. ‘I surprised, Steerforth--although candour honour,’ said Mr. Creakle, ‘does honour, certainly--I surprised, Steerforth, I must say, attach epithet person employed paid Salem House, sir.’ Steerforth gave short laugh. ‘That is answer, sir,’ said Mr. Creakle, ‘to remark. I expect you, Steerforth.’ If Mr. Mell looked homely, eyes, handsome boy, would quite impossible say homely Mr. Creakle looked. ‘Let deny it,’ said Steerforth. ‘Deny he beggar, Steerforth?’ cried Mr. Creakle. ‘Why, he go a-begging?’ ‘If he beggar himself, his near relation’s one,’ said Steerforth. ‘It is same.’ He glanced me, Mr. Mell’s hand gently patted upon shoulder. I looked flush upon face remorse heart, Mr. Mell’s eyes fixed Steerforth. He continued pat kindly shoulder, he looked him. ‘Since expect me, Mr. Creakle, justify myself,’ said Steerforth, ‘and say I mean,--what I say is, his mother lives charity alms-house.’ Mr. Mell still looked him, still patted kindly shoulder, said himself, whisper, I heard right: ‘Yes, I thought so.’ Mr. Creakle turned his assistant, severe frown laboured politeness: ‘Now, hear gentleman says, Mr. Mell. Have goodness, please, set right assembled school.’ ‘He right, sir, without correction,’ returned Mr. Mell, midst dead silence; ‘what he said true.’ ‘Be good declare publicly, you,’ said Mr. Creakle, putting his head one side, rolling his eyes round school, ‘whether ever came knowledge moment?’ ‘I believe directly,’ he returned. ‘Why, know not,’ said Mr. Creakle. ‘Do not you, man?’ ‘I apprehend never supposed worldly circumstances good,’ replied assistant. ‘You know position is, always been, here.’ ‘I apprehend, come that,’ said Mr. Creakle, his veins swelling bigger ever, ‘that you have wrong position altogether, mistook charity school. Mr. Mell, we will part, please. The sooner better.’ ‘There time,’ answered Mr. Mell, rising, ‘like present.’ ‘Sir, you!’ said Mr. Creakle. ‘I take leave you, Mr. Creakle, you,’ said Mr. Mell, glancing round room, patting gently shoulders. ‘James Steerforth, best wish I leave may come ashamed done today. At present I would prefer see anything rather friend, me, anyone I feel interest.’ Once he laid his hand upon shoulder; taking his flute books his desk, leaving key his successor, he went school, his property his arm. Mr. Creakle made speech, Tungay, he thanked Steerforth asserting (though perhaps warmly) independence respectability Salem House; he wound shaking hands Steerforth, gave three cheers--I quite know for, I supposed Steerforth, joined ardently, though I felt miserable. Mr. Creakle caned Tommy Traddles discovered tears, instead cheers, account Mr. Mell’s departure; went back his sofa, his bed, wherever he come from. We left now, looked blank, I recollect, one another. For myself, I felt much self-reproach contrition part happened, nothing would enabled keep back tears fear Steerforth, often looked me, I saw, might think unfriendly--or, I rather say, considering relative ages, feeling I regarded him, undutiful--if I showed emotion distressed me. He angry Traddles, said he glad he caught it. Poor Traddles, passed stage lying his head upon desk, relieving usual burst skeletons, said he did not care. Mr. Mell ill-used. ‘Who ill-used him, girl?’ said Steerforth. ‘Why, have,’ returned Traddles. ‘What I done?’ said Steerforth. ‘What done?’ retorted Traddles. ‘Hurt his feelings, lost his situation.’ ‘His feelings?’ repeated Steerforth disdainfully. ‘His feelings soon get better it, I will bound. His feelings like yours, Miss Traddles. As his situation--which precious one, was not it?--do suppose I going write home, take care he gets money? Polly?’ We thought intention noble Steerforth, whose mother widow, rich, would almost anything, said, he asked her. We extremely glad see Traddles put down, exalted Steerforth skies: especially he told us, he condescended do, he done done expressly us, because; he conferred great boon upon us unselfishly it. But I must say I going story dark night, Mr. Mell’s old flute seemed sound mournfully ears; last Steerforth tired, I lay bed, I fancied playing sorrowfully somewhere, I quite wretched. I soon forgot contemplation Steerforth, who, easy amateur way, without book (he seemed know everything heart), took his classes new master found. The new master came grammar school; he entered his duties, dined parlour one day, introduced Steerforth. Steerforth approved highly, told us he Brick. Without exactly understanding learned distinction meant this, I respected greatly it, doubt whatever his superior knowledge: though he never took pains me--not I anybody--that Mr. Mell taken. There one event half-year, daily school-life, made impression upon still survives. It survives many reasons. One afternoon, harassed state dire confusion, Mr. Creakle laying dreadfully, Tungay came in, called his usual strong way: ‘Visitors Copperfield!’ A words interchanged Mr. Creakle, as, visitors were, room shown into; I, had, according custom, stood announcement made, felt quite faint astonishment, told go back stairs get clean frill on, I repaired dining-room. These orders I obeyed, flutter hurry young spirits I never known before; I got parlour door, thought came head might mother--I thought Mr. Miss Murdstone then--I drew back hand lock, stopped sob I went in. At first I saw nobody; feeling pressure door, I looked round it, there, amazement, Mr. Peggotty Ham, ducking hats, squeezing one another wall. I could help laughing; much pleasure seeing them, appearance made. We shook hands cordial way; I laughed laughed, I pulled pocket-handkerchief wiped eyes. Mr. Peggotty (who never shut his mouth once, I remember, visit) showed great concern he saw this, nudged Ham say something. ‘Cheer up, Mas’r Davy bor’!’ said Ham, his simpering way. ‘Why, growed!’ ‘Am I grown?’ I said, drying eyes. I crying anything particular I know of; somehow made cry, see old friends. ‘Growed, Mas’r Davy bor’? Are not he growed!’ said Ham. ‘Are not he growed!’ said Mr. Peggotty. They made laugh laughing other, three laughed I danger crying again. ‘Do know mama is, Mr. Peggotty?’ I said. ‘And dear, dear, old Peggotty is?’ ‘Oncommon,’ said Mr. Peggotty. ‘And little Them’ly, Mrs. Gummidge?’ ‘On--common,’ said Mr. Peggotty. There silence. Mr. Peggotty, relieve it, took two prodigious lobsters, enormous crab, large canvas bag shrimps, his pockets, piled Ham’s arms. ‘You see,’ said Mr. Peggotty, ‘knowing partial little relish wittles along us, took liberty. The old Mawther biled ‘them, she did. Mrs. Gummidge biled ‘them. Yes,’ said Mr. Peggotty, slowly, I thought appeared stick subject account subject ready, ‘Mrs. Gummidge, I assure you, she biled ‘them.’ I expressed thanks; Mr. Peggotty, looking Ham, stood smiling sheepishly shellfish, without making attempt help him, said: ‘We come, see, wind tide making favour, one Yarmouth lugs Gravesen’. My sister she wrote name place, wrote ever I chanced come Gravesen’, I come inquire Mas’r Davy give her dooty, humbly wishing well reporting fam’ly oncommon toe-be-sure. Little Them’ly, see, she will write sister I go back, I see similarly oncommon, make quite merry-go-rounder.’ I obliged consider little I understood Mr. Peggotty meant figure, expressive complete circle intelligence. I thanked heartily; said, consciousness reddening, I supposed little Them’ly altered too, since used pick shells pebbles beach? ‘She is getting woman, that is wot she is getting be,’ said Mr. Peggotty. ‘Ask HIM.’ He meant Ham, beamed delight assent bag shrimps. ‘Her pretty face!’ said Mr. Peggotty, his shining like light. ‘Her learning!’ said Ham. ‘Her writing!’ said Mr. Peggotty. ‘Why it is black jet! And large is, might see anywheres.’ It perfectly delightful behold enthusiasm Mr. Peggotty became inspired he thought his little favourite. He stands again, his bluff hairy face irradiating joyful love pride, I find description. His honest eyes fire up, sparkle, depths stirred something bright. His broad chest heaves pleasure. His strong loose hands clench themselves, his earnestness; he emphasizes he says right arm shows, pigmy view, like sledge-hammer. Ham quite earnest he. I dare say would said much her, abashed unexpected coming Steerforth, who, seeing corner speaking two strangers, stopped song he singing, said: ‘I did not know here, young Copperfield!’ (for usual visiting room) crossed us his way out. I sure whether pride friend Steerforth, desire explain I came friend Mr. Peggotty, I called he going away. But I said, modestly--Good Heaven, comes back long time afterwards--! ‘Do not go, Steerforth, please. These two Yarmouth boatmen--very kind, good people--who relations nurse, come Gravesend see me.’ ‘Aye, aye?’ said Steerforth, returning. ‘I glad see them. How both?’ There ease his manner--a gay light manner was, swaggering--which I still believe borne kind enchantment it. I still believe him, virtue carriage, his animal spirits, his delightful voice, his handsome face figure, and, aught I know, inborn power attraction besides (which I think people possess), carried spell natural weakness yield, many persons could withstand. I could see pleased him, seemed open hearts moment. ‘You must let know home, please, Mr. Peggotty,’ I said, ‘when letter sent, Mr. Steerforth kind me, I do not know I ever without him.’ ‘Nonsense!’ said Steerforth, laughing. ‘You must not tell anything sort.’ ‘And Mr. Steerforth ever comes Norfolk Suffolk, Mr. Peggotty,’ I said, ‘while I there, may depend upon I shall bring Yarmouth, he let me, see house. You never saw good house, Steerforth. It is made boat!’ ‘Made boat, it?’ said Steerforth. ‘It is right sort house thorough-built boatman.’ ‘So ‘it is, sir, ‘it is, sir,’ said Ham, grinning. ‘You are right, young gen’l’m’n! Mas’r Davy bor’, gen’l’m’n’s right. A thorough-built boatman! Hor, hor! That is he is, too!’ Mr. Peggotty less pleased his nephew, though his modesty forbade claim personal compliment vociferously. ‘Well, sir,’ he said, bowing chuckling, tucking ends his neckerchief his breast: ‘I thankee, sir, I thankee! I endeavours line life, sir.’ ‘The best men more, Mr. Peggotty,’ said Steerforth. He got his name already. ‘I will pound it, it is wot yourself, sir,’ said Mr. Peggotty, shaking his head, ‘and wot well--right well! I thankee, sir. I am obleeged you, sir, welcoming manner me. I am rough, sir, I am ready--least ways, I hope I am ready, unnerstand. My house are not much see, sir, it is hearty service ever come along Mas’r Davy see it. I am reg’lar Dodman, I am,’ said Mr. Peggotty, he meant snail, allusion his slow go, he attempted go every sentence, somehow come back again; ‘but I wish well, I wish happy!’ Ham echoed sentiment, parted heartiest manner. I almost tempted evening tell Steerforth pretty little Them’ly, I timid mentioning her name, much afraid his laughing me. I remember I thought good deal, uneasy sort way, Mr. Peggotty said she getting woman; I decided nonsense. We transported shellfish, ‘relish’ Mr. Peggotty modestly called it, room unobserved, made great supper evening. But Traddles could not get happily it. He unfortunate even come supper like anybody else. He taken ill night--quite prostrate he was--in consequence Crab; drugged black draughts blue pills, extent Demple (whose father doctor) said enough undermine horse’s constitution, received caning six chapters Greek Testament refusing confess. The rest half-year jumble recollection daily strife struggle lives; waning summer changing season; frosty mornings rung bed, cold, cold smell dark nights rung bed again; evening schoolroom dimly lighted indifferently warmed, morning schoolroom nothing great shivering-machine; alternation boiled beef roast beef, boiled mutton roast mutton; clods bread-and-butter, dog’s-eared lesson-books, cracked slates, tear-blotted copy-books, canings, rulerings, hair-cuttings, rainy Sundays, suet-puddings, dirty atmosphere ink, surrounding all. I well remember though, distant idea holidays, seeming immense time stationary speck, began come towards us, grow grow. How counting months, came weeks, days; I began afraid I sent I learnt Steerforth I sent for, certainly go home, dim forebodings I might break leg first. How breaking-up day changed place fast, last, week next next week, week, day tomorrow, tomorrow, today, tonight--when I inside Yarmouth mail, going home. I many broken sleep inside Yarmouth mail, many incoherent dream things. But I awoke intervals, ground outside window playground Salem House, sound ears sound Mr. Creakle giving Traddles, sound coachman touching horses. CHAPTER 8. MY HOLIDAYS. ESPECIALLY ONE HAPPY AFTERNOON When arrived day inn mail stopped, inn friend waiter lived, I shown nice little bedroom, DOLPHIN painted door. Very cold I was, I know, notwithstanding hot tea given large fire downstairs; glad I turn Dolphin’s bed, pull Dolphin’s blankets round head, go sleep. Mr. Barkis carrier call morning nine of the clock. I got eight, little giddy shortness night’s rest, ready appointed time. He received exactly five minutes elapsed since last together, I hotel get change sixpence, something sort. As soon I box cart, carrier seated, lazy horse walked away us his accustomed pace. ‘You look well, Mr. Barkis,’ I said, thinking he would like know it. Mr. Barkis rubbed his cheek his cuff, looked his cuff he expected find bloom upon it; made acknowledgement compliment. ‘I gave message, Mr. Barkis,’ I said: ‘I wrote Peggotty.’ ‘Ah!’ said Mr. Barkis. Mr. Barkis seemed gruff, answered drily. ‘Was not right, Mr. Barkis?’ I asked, little hesitation. ‘Why, no,’ said Mr. Barkis. ‘Not message?’ ‘The message right enough, perhaps,’ said Mr. Barkis; ‘but come end there.’ Not understanding he meant, I repeated inquisitively: ‘Came end, Mr. Barkis?’ ‘Nothing come it,’ he explained, looking sideways. ‘No answer.’ ‘There answer expected, there, Mr. Barkis?’ said I, opening eyes. For new light me. ‘When man says he is willin’,’ said Mr. Barkis, turning his glance slowly again, ‘it is much say, man’s a-waitin’ answer.’ ‘Well, Mr. Barkis?’ ‘Well,’ said Mr. Barkis, carrying his eyes back his horse’s ears; ‘that man’s a-waitin’ answer ever since.’ ‘Have told her so, Mr. Barkis?’ ‘No--no,’ growled Mr. Barkis, reflecting it. ‘I are not got call go tell her so. I never said six words her myself, I are not a-going tell her so.’ ‘Would like it, Mr. Barkis?’ said I, doubtfully. ‘You might tell her, would,’ said Mr. Barkis, another slow look me, ‘that Barkis a-waitin’ answer. Says you--what name it?’ ‘Her name?’ ‘Ah!’ said Mr. Barkis, nod his head. ‘Peggotty.’ ‘Chrisen name? Or nat’ral name?’ said Mr. Barkis. ‘Oh, it is her Christian name. Her Christian name Clara.’ ‘Is though?’ said Mr. Barkis. He seemed find immense fund reflection circumstance, sat pondering inwardly whistling time. ‘Well!’ he resumed length. ‘Says you, “Peggotty! Barkis waitin’ answer.” Says she, perhaps, “Answer what?” Says you, “To I told you.” “What that?” says she. “Barkis willin’,” says you.’ This extremely artful suggestion Mr. Barkis accompanied nudge his elbow gave quite stitch side. After that, he slouched his horse his usual manner; made reference subject except, half hour afterwards, taking piece chalk his pocket, writing up, inside tilt cart, ‘Clara Peggotty’--apparently private memorandum. Ah, strange feeling going home home, find every object I looked at, reminded happy old home, like dream I could never dream again! The days mother I Peggotty one another, one come us, rose sorrowfully road, I sure I glad there--not sure I would rather remained away, forgotten Steerforth’s company. But I was; soon I house, bare old elm-trees wrung many hands bleak wintry air, shreds old rooks’-nests drifted away upon wind. The carrier put box garden-gate, left me. I walked along path towards house, glancing windows, fearing every step see Mr. Murdstone Miss Murdstone lowering one them. No face appeared, however; come house, knowing open door, dark, without knocking, I went quiet, timid step. God knows infantine memory may been, awakened within sound mother’s voice old parlour, I set foot hall. She singing low tone. I think I must lain her arms, heard her singing I baby. The strain new me, yet old filled heart brim-full; like friend come back long absence. I believed, solitary thoughtful way mother murmured her song, she alone. And I went softly room. She sitting fire, suckling infant, whose tiny hand she held her neck. Her eyes looking upon face, she sat singing it. I far right, she companion. I spoke her, she started, cried out. But seeing me, she called her dear Davy, her boy! coming half across room meet me, kneeled upon ground kissed me, laid head her bosom near little creature nestling there, put hand lips. I wish I died. I wish I died then, feeling heart! I fit Heaven I ever since. ‘He brother,’ said mother, fondling me. ‘Davy, pretty boy! My poor child!’ Then she kissed more, clasped round neck. This she Peggotty came running in, bounced ground beside us, went mad us quarter hour. It seemed I expected soon, carrier much his usual time. It seemed, too, Mr. Miss Murdstone gone upon visit neighbourhood, would return night. I never hoped this. I never thought possible three could together undisturbed, more; I felt, time, old days come back. We dined together fireside. Peggotty attendance wait upon us, mother would not let her it, made her dine us. I old plate, brown view man-of-war full sail upon it, Peggotty hoarded somewhere time I away, would broken, she said, hundred pounds. I old mug David it, old little knife fork would not cut. While table, I thought favourable occasion tell Peggotty Mr. Barkis, who, I finished I tell her, began laugh, throw her apron her face. ‘Peggotty,’ said mother. ‘What is matter?’ Peggotty laughed more, held her apron tight her face mother tried pull away, sat her head bag. ‘What doing, stupid creature?’ said mother, laughing. ‘Oh, drat man!’ cried Peggotty. ‘He wants marry me.’ ‘It would good match you; would not it?’ said mother. ‘Oh! I do not know,’ said Peggotty. ‘Do not ask me. I would not he made gold. Nor I would not anybody.’ ‘Then, do not tell so, ridiculous thing?’ said mother. ‘Tell so,’ retorted Peggotty, looking her apron. ‘He never said word it. He knows better. If he make bold say word me, I slap his face.’ Her red ever I saw it, face, I think; she covered again, moments time, she taken violent fit laughter; two three attacks, went her dinner. I remarked mother, though she smiled Peggotty looked her, became serious thoughtful. I seen first she changed. Her face pretty still, looked careworn, delicate; her hand thin white seemed almost transparent. But change I refer superadded this: her manner, became anxious fluttered. At last she said, putting her hand, laying affectionately hand her old servant, ‘Peggotty, dear, going married?’ ‘Me, madam?’ returned Peggotty, staring. ‘Lord bless you, no!’ ‘Not yet?’ said mother, tenderly. ‘Never!’ cried Peggotty. My mother took her hand, said: ‘Do not leave me, Peggotty. Stay me. It long, perhaps. What I ever without you!’ ‘Me leave you, precious!’ cried Peggotty. ‘Not world his wife. Why, what is put silly little head?’--For Peggotty used old talk mother sometimes like child. But mother made answer, except thank her, Peggotty went running her fashion. ‘Me leave you? I think I see myself. Peggotty go away you? I like catch her it! No, no, no,’ said Peggotty, shaking her head, folding her arms; ‘not she, dear. It is not are not Cats would well enough pleased she did, shall not pleased. They shall aggravated. I will stay till I cross cranky old woman. And I am deaf, lame, blind, mumbly want teeth, use all, even found fault with, I shall go Davy, ask take in.’ ‘And, Peggotty,’ says I, ‘I shall glad see you, I will make welcome queen.’ ‘Bless dear heart!’ cried Peggotty. ‘I know will!’ And she kissed beforehand, grateful acknowledgement hospitality. After that, she covered her head her apron another laugh Mr. Barkis. After that, she took baby little cradle, nursed it. After that, she cleared dinner table; that, came another cap on, her work-box, yard-measure, bit wax-candle, ever. We sat round fire, talked delightfully. I told hard master Mr. Creakle was, pitied much. I told fine fellow Steerforth was, patron mine, Peggotty said she would walk score miles see him. I took little baby arms awake, nursed lovingly. When asleep again, I crept close mother’s side according old custom, broken long time, sat arms embracing her waist, little red cheek her shoulder, felt her beautiful hair drooping me--like angel’s wing I used think, I recollect--and happy indeed. While I sat thus, looking fire, seeing pictures red-hot coals, I almost believed I never away; Mr. Miss Murdstone pictures, would vanish fire got low; nothing real I remembered, save mother, Peggotty, I. Peggotty darned away stocking long she could see, sat drawn her left hand like glove, her needle her right, ready take another stitch whenever blaze. I cannot conceive whose stockings Peggotty always darning, unfailing supply stockings want darning come from. From earliest infancy she seems always employed class needlework, never chance other. ‘I wonder,’ said Peggotty, sometimes seized fit wondering unexpected topic, ‘what is become Davy’s great-aunt?’ ‘Lor, Peggotty!’ observed mother, rousing herself reverie, ‘what nonsense talk!’ ‘Well, I really wonder, madam,’ said Peggotty. ‘What put person head?’ inquired mother. ‘Is nobody else world come there?’ ‘I do not know is,’ said Peggotty, ‘unless it is account stupid, head never pick choose people. They come go, do not come do not go, like. I wonder what is become her?’ ‘How absurd are, Peggotty!’ returned mother. ‘One would suppose wanted second visit her.’ ‘Lord forbid!’ cried Peggotty. ‘Well then, do not talk uncomfortable things, there is good soul,’ said mother. ‘Miss Betsey shut her cottage sea, doubt, remain there. At events, she likely ever trouble us again.’ ‘No!’ mused Peggotty. ‘No, are not likely all.---I wonder, she die, whether she would leave Davy anything?’ ‘Good gracious me, Peggotty,’ returned mother, ‘what nonsensical woman are! know she took offence poor dear boy’s ever born all.’ ‘I suppose she would not inclined forgive now,’ hinted Peggotty. ‘Why she inclined forgive now?’ said mother, rather sharply. ‘Now he is got brother, I mean,’ said Peggotty. My mother immediately began cry, wondered Peggotty dared say thing. ‘As poor little innocent cradle ever done harm anybody else, jealous thing!’ said she. ‘You much better go marry Mr. Barkis, carrier. Why do not you?’ ‘I make Miss Murdstone happy, I to,’ said Peggotty. ‘What bad disposition have, Peggotty!’ returned mother. ‘You jealous Miss Murdstone possible ridiculous creature be. You want keep keys yourself, give things, I suppose? I should not surprised did. When know she kindness best intentions! You know she does, Peggotty--you know well.’ Peggotty muttered something effect ‘Bother best intentions!’ something else effect little much best intentions going on. ‘I know mean, cross thing,’ said mother. ‘I understand you, Peggotty, perfectly. You know I do, I wonder do not colour like fire. But one point time. Miss Murdstone point now, Peggotty, shall not escape it. Have not heard her say, again, she thinks I thoughtless too--a--a--’ ‘Pretty,’ suggested Peggotty. ‘Well,’ returned mother, half laughing, ‘and she silly say so, I blamed it?’ ‘No one says can,’ said Peggotty. ‘No, I hope not, indeed!’ returned mother. ‘Have not heard her say, again, account she wished spare great deal trouble, she thinks I suited for, I really do not know I AM suited for; is not she early late, going fro continually--and does not she sorts things, grope sorts places, coal-holes pantries I do not know where, cannot agreeable--and mean insinuate sort devotion that?’ ‘I do not insinuate all,’ said Peggotty. ‘You do, Peggotty,’ returned mother. ‘You never anything else, except work. You always insinuating. You revel it. And talk Mr. Murdstone’s good intentions--’ ‘I never talked ‘them,’ said Peggotty. ‘No, Peggotty,’ returned mother, ‘but insinuated. That is I told now. That is worst you. You WILL insinuate. I said, moment, I understood you, see I did. When talk Mr. Murdstone’s good intentions, pretend slight (for I do not believe really do, heart, Peggotty), must well convinced I good are, actuate everything. If he seems stern certain person, Peggotty--you understand, I sure Davy, I alluding anybody present--it solely he satisfied certain person’s benefit. He naturally loves certain person, account; acts solely certain person’s good. He better able judge I am; I well know I weak, light, girlish creature, he firm, grave, serious man. And he takes,’ said mother, tears engendered her affectionate nature, stealing her face, ‘he takes great pains me; I ought thankful him, submissive even thoughts; I not, Peggotty, I worry condemn myself, feel doubtful heart, do not know do.’ Peggotty sat her chin foot stocking, looking silently fire. ‘There, Peggotty,’ said mother, changing her tone, ‘do not let us fall one another, I could not bear it. You true friend, I know, I world. When I call ridiculous creature, vexatious thing, anything sort, Peggotty, I mean true friend, always been, ever since night Mr. Copperfield first brought home here, came gate meet me.’ Peggotty slow respond, ratify treaty friendship giving one her best hugs. I think I glimpses real character conversation time; I sure, now, good creature originated it, took her part it, merely mother might comfort herself little contradictory summary she indulged. The design efficacious; I remember mother seemed ease rest evening, Peggotty observed her less. When tea, ashes thrown up, candles snuffed, I read Peggotty chapter Crocodile Book, remembrance old times--she took her pocket: I do not know whether she kept ever since--and talked Salem House, brought round Steerforth, great subject. We happy; evening, last race, destined evermore close volume life, never pass memory. It almost ten of the clock heard sound wheels. We got then; mother said hurriedly that, late, Mr. Miss Murdstone approved early hours young people, perhaps I better go bed. I kissed her, went upstairs candle directly, came in. It appeared childish fancy, I ascended bedroom I imprisoned, brought cold blast air house blew away old familiar feeling like feather. I felt uncomfortable going breakfast morning, I never set eyes Mr. Murdstone since day I committed memorable offence. However, must done, I went down, two three false starts half-way, many runs back tiptoe room, presented parlour. He standing fire his back it, Miss Murdstone made tea. He looked steadily I entered, made sign recognition whatever. I went him, moment confusion, said: ‘I beg pardon, sir. I sorry I did, I hope forgive me.’ ‘I glad hear sorry, David,’ he replied. The hand he gave hand I bitten. I could restrain eye resting instant red spot upon it; red I turned, I met sinister expression his face. ‘How do, madam?’ I said Miss Murdstone. ‘Ah, dear me!’ sighed Miss Murdstone, giving tea-caddy scoop instead her fingers. ‘How long holidays?’ ‘A month, madam.’ ‘Counting when?’ ‘From today, madam.’ ‘Oh!’ said Miss Murdstone. ‘Then here is one day off.’ She kept calendar holidays way, every morning checked day exactly manner. She gloomily she came ten, she got two figures she became hopeful, and, time advanced, even jocular. It first day I misfortune throw her, though she subject weakness general, state violent consternation. I came room she mother sitting; baby (who weeks old) mother’s lap, I took carefully arms. Suddenly Miss Murdstone gave scream I dropped it. ‘My dear Jane!’ cried mother. ‘Good heavens, Clara, see?’ exclaimed Miss Murdstone. ‘See what, dear Jane?’ said mother; ‘where?’ ‘He is got it!’ cried Miss Murdstone. ‘The boy got baby!’ She limp horror; stiffened herself make dart me, take arms. Then, she turned faint; ill obliged give her cherry brandy. I solemnly interdicted her, her recovery, touching brother pretence whatever; poor mother, who, I could see, wished otherwise, meekly confirmed interdict, saying: ‘No doubt right, dear Jane.’ On another occasion, three together, dear baby--it truly dear me, mother’s sake--was innocent occasion Miss Murdstone’s going passion. My mother, looking eyes lay upon her lap, said: ‘Davy! come here!’ looked mine. I saw Miss Murdstone lay her beads down. ‘I declare,’ said mother, gently, ‘they exactly alike. I suppose mine. I think colour mine. But wonderfully alike.’ ‘What talking about, Clara?’ said Miss Murdstone. ‘My dear Jane,’ faltered mother, little abashed harsh tone inquiry, ‘I find baby’s eyes Davy’s exactly alike.’ ‘Clara!’ said Miss Murdstone, rising angrily, ‘you positive fool sometimes.’ ‘My dear Jane,’ remonstrated mother. ‘A positive fool,’ said Miss Murdstone. ‘Who else could compare brother’s baby boy? They alike. They exactly unlike. They utterly dissimilar respects. I hope ever remain so. I sit here, hear comparisons made.’ With she stalked out, made door bang her. In short, I favourite Miss Murdstone. In short, I favourite anybody, even myself; like could show it, not, showed plainly I sensitive consciousness always appearing constrained, boorish, dull. I felt I made uncomfortable made me. If I came room were, talking together mother seemed cheerful, anxious cloud would steal her face moment entrance. If Mr. Murdstone his best humour, I checked him. If Miss Murdstone her worst, I intensified it. I perception enough know mother victim always; she afraid speak kind me, lest she give offence her manner so, receive lecture afterwards; she ceaselessly afraid her offending, offending, uneasily watched looks I moved. Therefore I resolved keep much way I could; many wintry hour I hear church clock strike, I sitting cheerless bedroom, wrapped little great-coat, poring book. In evening, sometimes, I went sat Peggotty kitchen. There I comfortable, afraid myself. But neither resources approved parlour. The tormenting humour dominant stopped both. I still held necessary poor mother’s training, and, one her trials, could suffered absent myself. ‘David,’ said Mr. Murdstone, one day dinner I going leave room usual; ‘I sorry observe sullen disposition.’ ‘As sulky bear!’ said Miss Murdstone. I stood still, hung head. ‘Now, David,’ said Mr. Murdstone, ‘a sullen obdurate disposition is, tempers, worst.’ ‘And boy’s is, dispositions ever I seen,’ remarked his sister, ‘the confirmed stubborn. I think, dear Clara, even must observe it?’ ‘I beg pardon, dear Jane,’ said mother, ‘but quite sure--I certain you will excuse me, dear Jane--that understand Davy?’ ‘I somewhat ashamed myself, Clara,’ returned Miss Murdstone, ‘if I could understand boy, boy. I do not profess profound; I lay claim common sense.’ ‘No doubt, dear Jane,’ returned mother, ‘your understanding vigorous--’ ‘Oh dear, no! Pray do not say that, Clara,’ interposed Miss Murdstone, angrily. ‘But I sure is,’ resumed mother; ‘and everybody knows is. I profit much myself, many ways--at least I ought to--that one convinced myself; therefore I speak great diffidence, dear Jane, I assure you.’ ‘We will say I do not understand boy, Clara,’ returned Miss Murdstone, arranging little fetters her wrists. ‘We will agree, please, I do not understand all. He much deep me. But perhaps brother’s penetration may enable insight his character. And I believe brother speaking subject we--not decently--interrupted him.’ ‘I think, Clara,’ said Mr. Murdstone, low grave voice, ‘that may better dispassionate judges question you.’ ‘Edward,’ replied mother, timidly, ‘you far better judge questions I pretend be. Both Jane are. I said--’ ‘You said something weak inconsiderate,’ he replied. ‘Try again, dear Clara, keep watch upon yourself.’ My mother’s lips moved, she answered ‘Yes, dear Edward,’ she said nothing aloud. ‘I sorry, David, I remarked,’ said Mr. Murdstone, turning his head his eyes stiffly towards me, ‘to observe sullen disposition. This character I suffer develop beneath eyes without effort improvement. You must endeavour, sir, change it. We must endeavour change you.’ ‘I beg pardon, sir,’ I faltered. ‘I never meant sullen since I came back.’ ‘Do not take refuge lie, sir!’ he returned fiercely, I saw mother involuntarily put her trembling hand interpose us. ‘You withdrawn sullenness room. You kept room ought here. You know now, all, I require here, there. Further, I require bring obedience here. You know me, David. I done.’ Miss Murdstone gave hoarse chuckle. ‘I respectful, prompt, ready bearing towards myself,’ he continued, ‘and towards Jane Murdstone, towards mother. I room shunned infected, pleasure child. Sit down.’ He ordered like dog, I obeyed like dog. ‘One thing more,’ he said. ‘I observe attachment low common company. You associate servants. The kitchen improve you, many respects need improvement. Of woman abets you, I say nothing--since you, Clara,’ addressing mother lower voice, ‘from old associations long-established fancies, weakness respecting her yet overcome.’ ‘A unaccountable delusion is!’ cried Miss Murdstone. ‘I say,’ he resumed, addressing me, ‘that I disapprove preferring company Mistress Peggotty, abandoned. Now, David, understand me, know consequence fail obey letter.’ I knew well--better perhaps he thought, far poor mother concerned--and I obeyed letter. I retreated room more; I took refuge Peggotty more; sat wearily parlour day day, looking forward night, bedtime. What irksome constraint I underwent, sitting attitude hours upon hours, afraid move arm leg lest Miss Murdstone complain (as she least pretence) restlessness, afraid move eye lest she light look dislike scrutiny would find new complaint mine! What intolerable dulness sit listening ticking clock; watching Miss Murdstone’s little shiny steel beads she strung them; wondering whether she would ever married, so, sort unhappy man; counting divisions moulding chimney-piece; wandering away, eyes, ceiling, among curls corkscrews paper wall! What walks I took alone, muddy lanes, bad winter weather, carrying parlour, Mr. Miss Murdstone it, everywhere: monstrous load I obliged bear, daymare possibility breaking in, weight brooded wits, blunted them! What meals I silence embarrassment, always feeling knife fork many, mine; appetite many, mine; plate chair many, mine; somebody many, I! What evenings, candles came, I expected employ myself, but, daring read entertaining book, pored hard-headed, harder-hearted treatise arithmetic; tables weights measures set tunes, ‘Rule Britannia’, ‘Away Melancholy’; would not stand still learnt, would go threading grandmother’s needle unfortunate head, one ear other! What yawns dozes I lapsed into, spite care; starts I came concealed sleeps with; answers I never got, little observations I rarely made; blank space I seemed, everybody overlooked, yet everybody’s way; heavy relief hear Miss Murdstone hail first stroke nine night, order bed! Thus holidays lagged away, morning came Miss Murdstone said: ‘Here is last day off!’ gave closing cup tea vacation. I sorry go. I lapsed stupid state; I recovering little looking forward Steerforth, albeit Mr. Creakle loomed behind him. Again Mr. Barkis appeared gate, Miss Murdstone her warning voice, said: ‘Clara!’ mother bent me, bid farewell. I kissed her, baby brother, sorry then; sorry go away, gulf us there, parting there, every day. And much embrace she gave me, lives mind, though fervent could be, followed embrace. I carrier’s cart I heard her calling me. I looked out, she stood garden-gate alone, holding her baby her arms see. It cold still weather; hair her head, fold her dress, stirred, she looked intently me, holding her child. So I lost her. So I saw her afterwards, sleep school--a silent presence near bed--looking intent face--holding her baby her arms. CHAPTER 9. I HAVE A MEMORABLE BIRTHDAY I PASS happened school, anniversary birthday came round March. Except Steerforth admired ever, I remember nothing. He going away end half-year, sooner, spirited independent eyes, therefore engaging before; beyond I remember nothing. The great remembrance time marked mind, seems swallowed lesser recollections, exist alone. It even difficult believe gap full two months return Salem House arrival birthday. I understand fact so, I know must so; otherwise I feel convinced interval, one occasion trod upon other’s heels. How well I recollect kind day was! I smell fog hung place; I see hoar frost, ghostly, it; I feel rimy hair fall clammy cheek; I look along dim perspective schoolroom, sputtering candle light foggy morning, breath boys wreathing smoking raw cold blow upon fingers, tap feet upon floor. It breakfast, summoned playground, Mr. Sharp entered said: ‘David Copperfield go parlour.’ I expected hamper Peggotty, brightened order. Some boys put claim forgotten distribution good things, I got seat great alacrity. ‘Do not hurry, David,’ said Mr. Sharp. ‘There is time enough, boy, do not hurry.’ I might surprised feeling tone he spoke, I given thought; I gave none afterwards. I hurried away parlour; I found Mr. Creakle, sitting his breakfast cane newspaper him, Mrs. Creakle opened letter her hand. But hamper. ‘David Copperfield,’ said Mrs. Creakle, leading sofa, sitting beside me. ‘I want speak particularly. I something tell you, child.’ Mr. Creakle, course I looked, shook his head without looking me, stopped sigh large piece buttered toast. ‘You young know world changes every day,’ said Mrs. Creakle, ‘and people pass away. But learn it, David; us young, us old, us times lives.’ I looked her earnestly. ‘When came away home end vacation,’ said Mrs. Creakle, pause, ‘were well?’ After another pause, ‘Was mama well?’ I trembled without distinctly knowing why, still looked her earnestly, making attempt answer. ‘Because,’ said she, ‘I grieve tell I hear morning mama ill.’ A mist rose Mrs. Creakle me, her figure seemed move instant. Then I felt burning tears run face, steady again. ‘She dangerously ill,’ she added. I knew now. ‘She dead.’ There need tell so. I already broken desolate cry, felt orphan wide world. She kind me. She kept day, left alone sometimes; I cried, wore sleep, awoke cried again. When I could cry more, I began think; oppression breast heaviest, grief dull pain ease for. And yet thoughts idle; intent calamity weighed upon heart, idly loitering near it. I thought house shut hushed. I thought little baby, who, Mrs. Creakle said, pining away time, who, believed, would die too. I thought father’s grave churchyard, house, mother lying beneath tree I knew well. I stood upon chair I left alone, looked glass see red eyes were, sorrowful face. I considered, hours gone, tears really hard flow now, seemed be, what, connexion loss, would affect think I drew near home--for I going home funeral. I sensible felt dignity attached among rest boys, I important affliction. If ever child stricken sincere grief, I was. But I remember importance kind satisfaction me, I walked playground afternoon boys school. When I saw glancing windows, went classes, I felt distinguished, looked melancholy, walked slower. When school over, came spoke me, I felt rather good proud them, take exactly notice all, before. I go home next night; mail, heavy night-coach, called Farmer, principally used country-people travelling short intermediate distances upon road. We story-telling evening, Traddles insisted lending his pillow. I do not know good he thought would me, I one own: he lend, poor fellow, except sheet letter-paper full skeletons; he gave parting, soother sorrows contribution peace mind. I left Salem House upon morrow afternoon. I little thought I left it, never return. We travelled slowly night, get Yarmouth nine ten of the clock morning. I looked Mr. Barkis, he there; instead fat, short-winded, merry-looking, little old man black, rusty little bunches ribbons knees his breeches, black stockings, broad-brimmed hat, came puffing coach window, said: ‘Master Copperfield?’ ‘Yes, sir.’ ‘Will come me, young sir, please,’ he said, opening door, ‘and I shall pleasure taking home.’ I put hand his, wondering he was, walked away shop narrow street, written OMER, DRAPER, TAILOR, HABERDASHER, FUNERAL FURNISHER, &c. It close stifling little shop; full sorts clothing, made unmade, including one window full beaver-hats bonnets. We went little back-parlour behind shop, found three young women work quantity black materials, heaped upon table, little bits cuttings littered floor. There good fire room, breathless smell warm black crape--I know smell then, I know now. The three young women, appeared industrious comfortable, raised heads look me, went work. Stitch, stitch, stitch. At time came workshop across little yard outside window, regular sound hammering kept kind tune: RAT--tat-tat, RAT--tat-tat, RAT--tat-tat, without variation. ‘Well,’ said conductor one three young women. ‘How get on, Minnie?’ ‘We shall ready trying-on time,’ she replied gaily, without looking up. ‘Do not afraid, father.’ Mr. Omer took his broad-brimmed hat, sat panted. He fat he obliged pant time he could say: ‘That is right.’ ‘Father!’ said Minnie, playfully. ‘What porpoise grow!’ ‘Well, I do not know is, dear,’ he replied, considering it. ‘I rather so.’ ‘You comfortable man, see,’ said Minnie. ‘You take things easy.’ ‘No use taking ‘them otherwise, dear,’ said Mr. Omer. ‘No, indeed,’ returned his daughter. ‘We pretty gay here, thank Heaven! Are not we, father?’ ‘I hope so, dear,’ said Mr. Omer. ‘As I got breath now, I think I will measure young scholar. Would walk shop, Master Copperfield?’ I preceded Mr. Omer, compliance his request; showing roll cloth he said extra super, good mourning anything short parents, he took various dimensions, put book. While he recording he called attention his stock trade, certain fashions he said ‘just come up’, certain fashions he said ‘just gone out’. ‘And sort thing often lose little mint money,’ said Mr. Omer. ‘But fashions like human beings. They come in, nobody knows when, why, how; go out, nobody knows when, why, how. Everything like life, opinion, look point view.’ I sorrowful discuss question, would possibly beyond circumstances; Mr. Omer took back parlour, breathing difficulty way. He called little break-neck range steps behind door: ‘Bring tea bread-and-butter!’ which, time, I sat looking thinking, listening stitching room tune hammered across yard, appeared tray, turned me. ‘I acquainted you,’ said Mr. Omer, watching minutes, I made much impression breakfast, black things destroyed appetite, ‘I acquainted long time, young friend.’ ‘Have you, sir?’ ‘All life,’ said Mr. Omer. ‘I may say it. I knew father you. He five foot nine half, he lays five-and-twen-ty foot ground.’ ‘RAT--tat-tat, RAT--tat-tat, RAT--tat-tat,’ across yard. ‘He lays five twen-ty foot ground, he lays fraction,’ said Mr. Omer, pleasantly. ‘It either his request her direction, I forget which.’ ‘Do know little brother is, sir?’ I inquired. Mr. Omer shook his head. ‘RAT--tat-tat, RAT--tat-tat, RAT--tat-tat.’ ‘He his mother’s arms,’ said he. ‘Oh, poor little fellow! Is he dead?’ ‘Do not mind help,’ said Mr. Omer. ‘Yes. The baby’s dead.’ My wounds broke afresh intelligence. I left scarcely-tasted breakfast, went rested head another table, corner little room, Minnie hastily cleared, lest I spot mourning lying tears. She pretty, good-natured girl, put hair away eyes soft, kind touch; she cheerful nearly finished her work good time, different me! Presently tune left off, good-looking young fellow came across yard room. He hammer his hand, his mouth full little nails, he obliged take he could speak. ‘Well, Joram!’ said Mr. Omer. ‘How get on?’ ‘All right,’ said Joram. ‘Done, sir.’ Minnie coloured little, two girls smiled one another. ‘What! candle-light last night, I club, then? Were you?’ said Mr. Omer, shutting one eye. ‘Yes,’ said Joram. ‘As said could make little trip it, go together, done, Minnie me--and you.’ ‘Oh! I thought going leave altogether,’ said Mr. Omer, laughing till he coughed. ‘--As good say that,’ resumed young man, ‘why I turned will, see. Will give opinion it?’ ‘I will,’ said Mr. Omer, rising. ‘My dear’; he stopped turned me: ‘would like see your--’ ‘No, father,’ Minnie interposed. ‘I thought might agreeable, dear,’ said Mr. Omer. ‘But perhaps you are right.’ I cannot say I knew dear, dear mother’s coffin went look at. I never heard one making; I never seen one I know of.--but came mind noise was, going on; young man entered, I sure I knew he doing. The work finished, two girls, whose names I heard, brushed shreds threads dresses, went shop put rights, wait customers. Minnie stayed behind fold made, pack two baskets. This she upon her knees, humming lively little tune while. Joram, I doubt her lover, came stole kiss her she busy (he did not appear mind me, all), said her father gone chaise, he must make haste get ready. Then he went again; she put her thimble scissors her pocket, stuck needle threaded black thread neatly bosom her gown, put her outer clothing smartly, little glass behind door, I saw reflection her pleased face. All I observed, sitting table corner head leaning hand, thoughts running different things. The chaise soon came round front shop, baskets put first, I put next, three followed. I remember kind half chaise-cart, half pianoforte-van, painted sombre colour, drawn black horse long tail. There plenty room us all. I think I ever experienced strange feeling life (I wiser now, perhaps) them, remembering employed, seeing enjoy ride. I angry them; I afraid them, I cast away among creatures I community nature. They cheerful. The old man sat front drive, two young people sat behind him, whenever he spoke leaned forward, one one side his chubby face other, made great deal him. They would talked too, I held back, moped corner; scared love-making hilarity, though far boisterous, almost wondering judgement came upon hardness heart. So, stopped bait horse, ate drank enjoyed themselves, I could touch nothing touched, kept fast unbroken. So, reached home, I dropped chaise behind, quickly possible, I might company solemn windows, looking blindly like closed eyes bright. And oh, little need I think would move tears I came back--seeing window mother’s room, next which, better time, mine! I Peggotty’s arms I got door, she took house. Her grief burst she first saw me; she controlled soon, spoke whispers, walked softly, dead could disturbed. She bed, I found, long time. She sat night still, watched. As long her poor dear pretty ground, she said, she would never desert her. Mr. Murdstone took heed I went parlour he was, sat fireside, weeping silently, pondering his elbow-chair. Miss Murdstone, busy her writing-desk, covered letters papers, gave her cold finger-nails, asked me, iron whisper, I measured mourning. I said: ‘Yes.’ ‘And shirts,’ said Miss Murdstone; ‘have brought ‘them home?’ ‘Yes, madam. I brought home clothes.’ This consolation her firmness administered me. I doubt she choice pleasure exhibiting she called her self-command, her firmness, her strength mind, her common sense, whole diabolical catalogue her unamiable qualities, occasion. She particularly proud her turn business; she showed reducing everything pen ink, moved nothing. All rest day, morning night afterwards, she sat desk, scratching composedly hard pen, speaking imperturbable whisper everybody; never relaxing muscle her face, softening tone her voice, appearing atom her dress astray. Her brother took book sometimes, never read I saw. He would open look he reading, would remain whole hour without turning leaf, put walk fro room. I used sit folded hands watching him, counting his footsteps, hour hour. He seldom spoke her, never me. He seemed restless thing, except clocks, whole motionless house. In days funeral, I saw little Peggotty, except that, passing stairs, I always found her close room mother her baby lay, except she came every night, sat bed’s head I went sleep. A day two burial--I think day two before, I conscious confusion mind heavy time, nothing mark progress--she took room. I recollect underneath white covering bed, beautiful cleanliness freshness around it, seemed lie embodied solemn stillness house; she would turned cover gently back, I cried: ‘Oh no! oh no!’ held her hand. If funeral yesterday, I could recollect better. The air best parlour, I went door, bright condition fire, shining wine decanters, patterns glasses plates, faint sweet smell cake, odour Miss Murdstone’s dress, black clothes. Mr. Chillip room, comes speak me. ‘And Master David?’ he says, kindly. I cannot tell well. I give hand, he holds his. ‘Dear me!’ says Mr. Chillip, meekly smiling, something shining his eye. ‘Our little friends grow around us. They grow knowledge, madam?’ This Miss Murdstone, makes reply. ‘There great improvement here, madam?’ says Mr. Chillip. Miss Murdstone merely answers frown formal bend: Mr. Chillip, discomfited, goes corner, keeping him, opens his mouth more. I remark this, I remark everything happens, I care myself, done since I came home. And bell begins sound, Mr. Omer another come make us ready. As Peggotty will not tell me, long ago, followers father grave made ready room. There Mr. Murdstone, neighbour Mr. Grayper, Mr. Chillip, I. When go door, Bearers load garden; move us path, past elms, gate, churchyard, I often heard birds sing summer morning. We stand around grave. The day seems different every day, light colour--of sadder colour. Now solemn hush, brought home resting mould; stand bareheaded, I hear voice clergyman, sounding remote open air, yet distinct plain, saying: ‘I Resurrection Life, saith Lord!’ Then I hear sobs; and, standing apart among lookers-on, I see good faithful servant, people upon earth I love best, unto childish heart certain Lord one day say: ‘Well done.’ There many faces I know, among little crowd; faces I knew church, mine always wondering there; faces first saw mother, she came village her youthful bloom. I mind them--I mind nothing grief--and yet I see know all; even background, far away, see Minnie looking on, her eye glancing her sweetheart, near me. It over, earth filled in, turn come away. Before us stands house, pretty unchanged, linked mind young idea gone, sorrow nothing sorrow calls forth. But take on; Mr. Chillip talks me; get home, puts water lips; I ask his leave go room, dismisses gentleness woman. All this, I say, yesterday’s event. Events later date floated shore forgotten things reappear, stands like high rock ocean. I knew Peggotty would come room. The Sabbath stillness time (the day like Sunday! I forgotten that) suited us both. She sat side upon little bed; holding hand, sometimes putting her lips, sometimes smoothing hers, she might comforted little brother, told me, her way, she tell concerning happened. ‘She never well,’ said Peggotty, ‘for long time. She uncertain her mind, happy. When her baby born, I thought first she would get better, she delicate, sunk little every day. She used like sit alone her baby came, she cried; afterwards she used sing it--so soft, I thought, I heard her, like voice air, rising away. ‘I think she got timid, frightened-like, late; hard word like blow her. But she always me. She never changed her foolish Peggotty, did not sweet girl.’ Here Peggotty stopped, softly beat upon hand little while. ‘The last time I saw her like her old self, night came home, dear. The day went away, she said me, “I never shall see pretty darling again. Something tells so, tells truth, I know.” ‘She tried hold that; many time, told her she thoughtless light-hearted, made believe so; bygone then. She never told her husband she told me--she afraid saying anybody else--till one night, little week happened, she said him: “My dear, I think I dying.” ‘“It is mind now, Peggotty,” she told me, I laid her her bed night. “He believe more, poor fellow, every day days come; past. I tired. If sleep, sit I sleep: do not leave me. God bless children! God protect keep fatherless boy!” ‘I never left her afterwards,’ said Peggotty. ‘She often talked two downstairs--for she loved them; she could not bear love anyone her--but went away her bed-side, she always turned me, rest Peggotty was, never fell asleep way. ‘On last night, evening, she kissed me, said: “If baby die too, Peggotty, please let lay arms, bury us together.” (It done; poor lamb lived day beyond her.) “Let dearest boy go us resting-place,” she said, “and tell his mother, she lay here, blessed once, thousand times.”’ Another silence followed this, another gentle beating hand. ‘It pretty far night,’ said Peggotty, ‘when she asked drink; she taken it, gave patient smile, dear!--so beautiful! ‘Daybreak come, sun rising, she said me, kind considerate Mr. Copperfield always her, he borne her, told her, she doubted herself, loving heart better stronger wisdom, he happy man hers. “Peggotty, dear,” she said then, “put nearer you,” she weak. “Lay good arm underneath neck,” she said, “and turn you, face going far off, I want near.” I put she asked; oh Davy! time come first parting words true--when she glad lay her poor head her stupid cross old Peggotty’s arm--and she died like child gone sleep!’ Thus ended Peggotty’s narration. From moment knowing death mother, idea her she late vanished me. I remembered her, instant, young mother earliest impressions, used wind her bright curls round round her finger, dance twilight parlour. What Peggotty told now, far bringing back later period, rooted earlier image mind. It may curious, true. In her death she winged her way back her calm untroubled youth, cancelled rest. The mother lay grave, mother infancy; little creature her arms, myself, I been, hushed ever her bosom. CHAPTER 10. I BECOME NEGLECTED, AND AM PROVIDED FOR The first act business Miss Murdstone performed day solemnity over, light freely admitted house, give Peggotty month’s warning. Much Peggotty would disliked service, I believe she would retained it, sake, preference best upon earth. She told must part, told why; condoled one another, sincerity. As future, word said, step taken. Happy would been, I dare say, could dismissed month’s warning too. I mustered courage once, ask Miss Murdstone I going back school; she answered dryly, she believed I going back all. I told nothing more. I anxious know going done me, Peggotty; neither she I could pick information subject. There one change condition, which, relieved great deal present uneasiness, might made me, I capable considering closely, yet uncomfortable future. It this. The constraint put upon me, quite abandoned. I far required keep dull post parlour, several occasions, I took seat there, Miss Murdstone frowned go away. I far warned Peggotty’s society, that, provided I Mr. Murdstone’s, I never sought inquired for. At first I daily dread his taking education hand again, Miss Murdstone’s devoting herself it; I soon began think fears groundless, I anticipate neglect. I conceive discovery gave much pain then. I still giddy shock mother’s death, kind stunned state tributary things. I recollect, indeed, speculated, odd times, possibility taught more, cared more; growing shabby, moody man, lounging idle life away, village; well feasibility getting rid picture going away somewhere, like hero story, seek fortune: transient visions, daydreams I sat looking sometimes, faintly painted written wall room, which, melted away, left wall blank again. ‘Peggotty,’ I said thoughtful whisper, one evening, I warming hands kitchen fire, ‘Mr. Murdstone likes less he used to. He never liked much, Peggotty; he would rather even see now, he help it.’ ‘Perhaps it is his sorrow,’ said Peggotty, stroking hair. ‘I sure, Peggotty, I sorry too. If I believed his sorrow, I think all. But it is that; oh, no, it is that.’ ‘How know it is that?’ said Peggotty, silence. ‘Oh, his sorrow another quite different thing. He sorry moment, sitting fireside Miss Murdstone; I go in, Peggotty, he would something besides.’ ‘What would he be?’ said Peggotty. ‘Angry,’ I answered, involuntary imitation his dark frown. ‘If he sorry, he would not look he does. I sorry, makes feel kinder.’ Peggotty said nothing little while; I warmed hands, silent she. ‘Davy,’ she said length. ‘Yes, Peggotty?’ ‘I tried, dear, ways I could think of--all ways are, ways are not, short--to get suitable service here, Blunderstone; there is thing, love.’ ‘And mean do, Peggotty,’ says I, wistfully. ‘Do mean go seek fortune?’ ‘I expect I shall forced go Yarmouth,’ replied Peggotty, ‘and live there.’ ‘You might gone farther off,’ I said, brightening little, ‘and bad lost. I shall see sometimes, dear old Peggotty, there. You will not quite end world, you?’ ‘Contrary ways, please God!’ cried Peggotty, great animation. ‘As long here, pet, I shall come every week life see you. One day, every week life!’ I felt great weight taken mind promise: even all, Peggotty went say: ‘I am a-going, Davy, see, brother’s, first, another fortnight’s visit--just till I time look me, get something like again. Now, I thinking perhaps, do not want present, might let go along me.’ If anything, short different relation every one me, Peggotty excepted, could given sense pleasure time, would project others. The idea surrounded honest faces, shining welcome me; renewing peacefulness sweet Sunday morning, bells ringing, stones dropping water, shadowy ships breaking mist; roaming little Them’ly, telling her troubles, finding charms shells pebbles beach; made calm heart. It ruffled next moment, sure, doubt Miss Murdstone’s giving her consent; even set rest soon, she came take evening grope store-closet yet conversation, Peggotty, boldness amazed me, broached topic spot. ‘The boy idle there,’ said Miss Murdstone, looking pickle-jar, ‘and idleness root evil. But, sure, he would idle here--or anywhere, opinion.’ Peggotty angry answer ready, I could see; she swallowed sake, remained silent. ‘Humph!’ said Miss Murdstone, still keeping her eye pickles; ‘it importance anything else--it paramount importance--that brother disturbed made uncomfortable. I suppose I better say yes.’ I thanked her, without making demonstration joy, lest induce her withdraw her assent. Nor could I help thinking prudent course, since she looked pickle-jar, great access sourness her black eyes absorbed contents. However, permission given, never retracted; month out, Peggotty I ready depart. Mr. Barkis came house Peggotty’s boxes. I never known pass garden-gate before, occasion he came house. And he gave look he shouldered largest box went out, I thought meaning it, meaning could ever said find way Mr. Barkis’s visage. Peggotty naturally low spirits leaving her home many years, two strong attachments her life--for mother myself--had formed. She walking churchyard, too, early; she got cart, sat her handkerchief her eyes. So long she remained condition, Mr. Barkis gave sign life whatever. He sat his usual place attitude like great stuffed figure. But she began look her, speak me, he nodded his head grinned several times. I least notion whom, he meant it. ‘It is beautiful day, Mr. Barkis!’ I said, act politeness. ‘It are not bad,’ said Mr. Barkis, generally qualified his speech, rarely committed himself. ‘Peggotty quite comfortable now, Mr. Barkis,’ I remarked, his satisfaction. ‘Is she, though?’ said Mr. Barkis. After reflecting it, sagacious air, Mr. Barkis eyed her, said: ‘ARE pretty comfortable?’ Peggotty laughed, answered affirmative. ‘But really truly, know. Are you?’ growled Mr. Barkis, sliding nearer her seat, nudging her his elbow. ‘Are you? Really truly pretty comfortable? Are you? Eh?’ At inquiries Mr. Barkis shuffled nearer her, gave her another nudge; last crowded together left-hand corner cart, I squeezed I could hardly bear it. Peggotty calling his attention sufferings, Mr. Barkis gave little room once, got away degrees. But I could help observing he seemed think he hit upon wonderful expedient expressing neat, agreeable, pointed manner, without inconvenience inventing conversation. He manifestly chuckled time. By he turned Peggotty again, repeating, ‘Are pretty comfortable though?’ bore upon us before, breath nearly edged body. By he made another descent upon us inquiry, result. At length, I got whenever I saw coming, standing foot-board, pretended look prospect; I well. He polite stop public-house, expressly account, entertain us broiled mutton beer. Even Peggotty act drinking, he seized one approaches, almost choked her. But drew nearer end journey, he less time gallantry; got Yarmouth pavement, much shaken jolted, I apprehend, leisure anything else. Mr. Peggotty Ham waited us old place. They received Peggotty affectionate manner, shook hands Mr. Barkis, who, his hat back his head, shame-faced leer upon his countenance, pervading his legs, presented vacant appearance, I thought. They took one Peggotty’s trunks, going away, Mr. Barkis solemnly made sign his forefinger come archway. ‘I say,’ growled Mr. Barkis, ‘it right.’ I looked his face, answered, attempt profound: ‘Oh!’ ‘It did not come end there,’ said Mr. Barkis, nodding confidentially. ‘It right.’ Again I answered, ‘Oh!’ ‘You know willin’,’ said friend. ‘It Barkis, Barkis only.’ I nodded assent. ‘It is right,’ said Mr. Barkis, shaking hands; ‘I am friend your’n. You made right, first. It is right.’ In his attempts particularly lucid, Mr. Barkis extremely mysterious, I might stood looking his face hour, assuredly got much information face clock stopped, Peggotty’s calling away. As going along, she asked he said; I told her he said right. ‘Like his impudence,’ said Peggotty, ‘but I do not mind that! Davy dear, think I think married?’ ‘Why--I suppose would like much then, Peggotty, now?’ I returned, little consideration. Greatly astonishment passengers street, well her relations going before, good soul obliged stop embrace spot, many protestations her unalterable love. ‘Tell say, darling?’ she asked again, over, walking on. ‘If thinking married--to Mr. Barkis, Peggotty?’ ‘Yes,’ said Peggotty. ‘I think would good thing. For know, Peggotty, would always horse cart bring see me, could come nothing, sure coming.’ ‘The sense dear!’ cried Peggotty. ‘What I thinking of, month back! Yes, precious; I think I independent altogether, see; let alone working better heart house, I could anybody else’s now. I do not know I might fit for, now, servant stranger. And I shall always near pretty’s resting-place,’ said Peggotty, musing, ‘and able see I like; I lie rest, I may laid far darling girl!’ We neither us said anything little while. ‘But I would not much give another thought,’ said Peggotty, cheerily ‘if Davy anyways it--not I asked church thirty times three times over, wearing ring pocket.’ ‘Look me, Peggotty,’ I replied; ‘and see I really glad, do not truly wish it!’ As indeed I did, heart. ‘Well, life,’ said Peggotty, giving squeeze, ‘I thought night day, every way I can, I hope right way; I will think again, speak brother it, meantime we will keep ourselves, Davy, me. Barkis good plain creature,’ said Peggotty, ‘and I tried duty him, I think would fault I was not--if I was not pretty comfortable,’ said Peggotty, laughing heartily. This quotation Mr. Barkis appropriate, tickled us much, laughed again, quite pleasant humour came within view Mr. Peggotty’s cottage. It looked same, except may, perhaps, shrunk little eyes; Mrs. Gummidge waiting door she stood ever since. All within same, seaweed blue mug bedroom. I went out-house look me; lobsters, crabs, crawfish possessed desire pinch world general, appeared state conglomeration old corner. But little Them’ly seen, I asked Mr. Peggotty she was. ‘She is school, sir,’ said Mr. Peggotty, wiping heat consequent porterage Peggotty’s box his forehead; ‘she will home,’ looking Dutch clock, ‘in twenty minutes half-an-hour’s time. We us feel loss her, bless ye!’ Mrs. Gummidge moaned. ‘Cheer up, Mawther!’ cried Mr. Peggotty. ‘I feel anybody else,’ said Mrs. Gummidge; ‘I am lone lorn creetur’, she used a’most thing did not go contrary me.’ Mrs. Gummidge, whimpering shaking her head, applied herself blowing fire. Mr. Peggotty, looking round upon us she engaged, said low voice, he shaded his hand: ‘The old ‘un!’ From I rightly conjectured improvement taken place since last visit state Mrs. Gummidge’s spirits. Now, whole place was, been, quite delightful place ever; yet impress way. I felt rather disappointed it. Perhaps little Them’ly home. I knew way she would come, presently found strolling along path meet her. A figure appeared distance long, I soon knew Them’ly, little creature still stature, though she grown. But she drew nearer, I saw her blue eyes looking bluer, her dimpled face looking brighter, her whole self prettier gayer, curious feeling came made pretend know her, pass I looking something long way off. I done thing since later life, I mistaken. Little Them’ly did not care bit. She saw well enough; instead turning round calling me, ran away laughing. This obliged run her, she ran fast near cottage I caught her. ‘Oh, it is you, it?’ said little Them’ly. ‘Why, knew was, Them’ly,’ said I. ‘And did not YOU know was?’ said Them’ly. I going kiss her, she covered her cherry lips her hands, said she was not baby now, ran away, laughing ever, house. She seemed delight teasing me, change her I wondered much. The tea table ready, little locker put old place, instead coming sit me, she went bestowed her company upon grumbling Mrs. Gummidge: Mr. Peggotty’s inquiring why, rumpled her hair her face hide it, could nothing laugh. ‘A little puss, is!’ said Mr. Peggotty, patting her his great hand. ‘So sh’ is! sh’ is!’ cried Ham. ‘Mas’r Davy bor’, sh’ is!’ he sat chuckled her time, state mingled admiration delight, made his face burning red. Little Them’ly spoiled all, fact; one Mr. Peggotty himself, she could coaxed anything, going laying her cheek his rough whisker. That opinion, least, I saw her it; I held Mr. Peggotty thoroughly right. But she affectionate sweet-natured, pleasant manner sly shy once, she captivated ever. She tender-hearted, too; when, sat round fire tea, allusion made Mr. Peggotty his pipe loss I sustained, tears stood her eyes, she looked kindly across table, I felt quite thankful her. ‘Ah!’ said Mr. Peggotty, taking her curls, running his hand like water, ‘here is another orphan, see, sir. And here,’ said Mr. Peggotty, giving Ham backhanded knock chest, ‘is another ‘them, though he do not look much like it.’ ‘If I guardian, Mr. Peggotty,’ said I, shaking head, ‘I do not think I FEEL much like it.’ ‘Well said, Mas’r Davy bor’!’ cried Ham, ecstasy. ‘Hoorah! Well said! Nor would not! Hor! Hor!’--Here he returned Mr. Peggotty’s back-hander, little Them’ly got kissed Mr. Peggotty. ‘And how is friend, sir?’ said Mr. Peggotty me. ‘Steerforth?’ said I. ‘That is name!’ cried Mr. Peggotty, turning Ham. ‘I knowed something way.’ ‘You said Rudderford,’ observed Ham, laughing. ‘Well!’ retorted Mr. Peggotty. ‘And ye steer rudder, do not ye? It are not fur off. How he, sir?’ ‘He well indeed I came away, Mr. Peggotty.’ ‘There is friend!’ said Mr. Peggotty, stretching his pipe. ‘There is friend, talk friends! Why, Lord love heart alive, are not treat look him!’ ‘He handsome, he not?’ said I, heart warming praise. ‘Handsome!’ cried Mr. Peggotty. ‘He stands like--like a--why I do not know he do not stand like. He is bold!’ ‘Yes! That is his character,’ said I. ‘He is brave lion, cannot think frank he is, Mr. Peggotty.’ ‘And I suppose, now,’ said Mr. Peggotty, looking smoke his pipe, ‘that way book-larning he would take wind a’most anything.’ ‘Yes,’ said I, delighted; ‘he knows everything. He astonishingly clever.’ ‘There is friend!’ murmured Mr. Peggotty, grave toss his head. ‘Nothing seems cost trouble,’ said I. ‘He knows task he looks it. He best cricketer ever saw. He give almost many men like draughts, beat easily.’ Mr. Peggotty gave his head another toss, much say: ‘Of course he will.’ ‘He speaker,’ I pursued, ‘that he win anybody over; I do not know you would say hear sing, Mr. Peggotty.’ Mr. Peggotty gave his head another toss, much say: ‘I doubt it.’ ‘Then, he is generous, fine, noble fellow,’ said I, quite carried away favourite theme, ‘that it is hardly possible give much praise he deserves. I sure I never feel thankful enough generosity he protected me, much younger lower school himself.’ I running on, fast indeed, eyes rested little Them’ly’s face, bent forward table, listening deepest attention, her breath held, her blue eyes sparkling like jewels, colour mantling her cheeks. She looked extraordinarily earnest pretty, I stopped sort wonder; observed her time, I stopped, laughed looked her. ‘Them’ly like me,’ said Peggotty, ‘and would like see him.’ Them’ly confused observing her, hung her head, her face covered blushes. Glancing presently her stray curls, seeing looking her still (I sure I, one, could looked her hours), she ran away, kept away till nearly bedtime. I lay old little bed stern boat, wind came moaning across flat done before. But I could help fancying, now, moaned gone; instead thinking sea might rise night float boat away, I thought sea risen, since I last heard sounds, drowned happy home. I recollect, wind water began sound fainter ears, putting short clause prayers, petitioning I might grow marry little Them’ly, dropping lovingly asleep. The days passed pretty much passed before, except--it great exception--that little Them’ly I seldom wandered beach now. She tasks learn, needle-work do; absent great part day. But I felt old wanderings, even otherwise. Wild full childish whims Them’ly was, she little woman I supposed. She seemed got great distance away me, little year. She liked me, she laughed me, tormented me; I went meet her, stole home another way, laughing door I came back, disappointed. The best times she sat quietly work doorway, I sat wooden step her feet, reading her. It seems me, hour, I never seen sunlight bright April afternoons; I never seen sunny little figure I used see, sitting doorway old boat; I never beheld sky, water, glorified ships sailing away golden air. On first evening arrival, Mr. Barkis appeared exceedingly vacant awkward condition, bundle oranges tied handkerchief. As he made allusion kind property, he supposed left behind accident he went away; Ham, running restore it, came back information intended Peggotty. After occasion he appeared every evening exactly hour, always little bundle, he never alluded, he regularly put behind door left there. These offerings affection various eccentric description. Among I remember double set pigs’ trotters, huge pin-cushion, half bushel apples, pair jet earrings, Spanish onions, box dominoes, canary bird cage, leg pickled pork. Mr. Barkis’s wooing, I remember it, altogether peculiar kind. He seldom said anything; would sit fire much attitude he sat his cart, stare heavily Peggotty, opposite. One night, being, I suppose, inspired love, he made dart bit wax-candle she kept her thread, put his waistcoat-pocket carried off. After that, his great delight produce wanted, sticking lining his pocket, partially melted state, pocket done with. He seemed enjoy much, feel called upon talk. Even he took Peggotty walk flats, he uneasiness head, I believe; contenting asking her she pretty comfortable; I remember sometimes, he gone, Peggotty would throw her apron her face, laugh half-an-hour. Indeed, less amused, except miserable Mrs. Gummidge, whose courtship would appear exactly parallel nature, she continually reminded transactions old one. At length, term visit nearly expired, given Peggotty Mr. Barkis going make day’s holiday together, little Them’ly I accompany them. I broken sleep night before, anticipation pleasure whole day Them’ly. We astir betimes morning; yet breakfast, Mr. Barkis appeared distance, driving chaise-cart towards object his affections. Peggotty dressed usual, her neat quiet mourning; Mr. Barkis bloomed new blue coat, tailor given good measure, cuffs would rendered gloves unnecessary coldest weather, collar high pushed his hair end top his head. His bright buttons, too, largest size. Rendered complete drab pantaloons buff waistcoat, I thought Mr. Barkis phenomenon respectability. When bustle outside door, I found Mr. Peggotty prepared old shoe, thrown us luck, he offered Mrs. Gummidge purpose. ‘No. It better done somebody else, Dan’l,’ said Mrs. Gummidge. ‘I am lone lorn creetur’ myself, everythink reminds creetur’s are not lone lorn, goes contrary me.’ ‘Come, old gal!’ cried Mr. Peggotty. ‘Take heave it.’ ‘No, Dan’l,’ returned Mrs. Gummidge, whimpering shaking her head. ‘If I felt less, I could more. You do not feel like me, Dan’l; thinks do not go contrary you, them; better yourself.’ But Peggotty, going one another hurried way, kissing everybody, called cart, time (Them’ly I two little chairs, side side), Mrs. Gummidge must it. So Mrs. Gummidge it; and, I sorry relate, cast damp upon festive character departure, immediately bursting tears, sinking subdued arms Ham, declaration she knowed she burden, better carried House once. Which I really thought sensible idea, Ham might acted on. Away went, however, holiday excursion; first thing stop church, Mr. Barkis tied horse rails, went Peggotty, leaving little Them’ly alone chaise. I took occasion put arm round Them’ly’s waist, propose I going away soon now, determine affectionate one another, happy, day. Little Them’ly consenting, allowing kiss her, I became desperate; informing her, I recollect, I never could love another, I prepared she would blood anybody aspire her affections. How merry little Them’ly made herself it! With demure assumption immensely older wiser I, fairy little woman said I ‘a silly boy’; laughed charmingly I forgot pain called disparaging name, pleasure looking her. Mr. Barkis Peggotty good church, came last, drove away country. As going along, Mr. Barkis turned me, said, wink,--by by, I hardly thought, before, he could wink: ‘What name I wrote cart?’ ‘Clara Peggotty,’ I answered. ‘What name would I write now, tilt here?’ ‘Clara Peggotty, again?’ I suggested. ‘Clara Peggotty BARKIS!’ he returned, burst roar laughter shook chaise. In word, married, gone church purpose. Peggotty resolved quietly done; clerk given her away, witnesses ceremony. She little confused Mr. Barkis made abrupt announcement union, could hug enough token her unimpaired affection; she soon became herself again, said she glad over. We drove little inn by-road, expected, comfortable dinner, passed day great satisfaction. If Peggotty married every day last ten years, she could hardly her ease it; made sort difference her: she ever, went stroll little Them’ly tea, Mr. Barkis philosophically smoked his pipe, enjoyed himself, I suppose, contemplation his happiness. If so, sharpened his appetite; I distinctly call mind that, although he eaten good deal pork greens dinner, finished fowl two, he obliged cold boiled bacon tea, disposed large quantity without emotion. I often thought, since, odd, innocent, out-of-the-way kind wedding must been! We got chaise soon dark, drove cosily back, looking stars, talking them. I chief exponent, opened Mr. Barkis’s mind amazing extent. I told I knew, he would believed anything I might taken head impart him; he profound veneration abilities, informed his wife hearing, occasion, I ‘a young Roeshus’--by I think he meant prodigy. When exhausted subject stars, rather I exhausted mental faculties Mr. Barkis, little Them’ly I made cloak old wrapper, sat rest journey. Ah, I loved her! What happiness (I thought) married, going away anywhere live among trees fields, never growing older, never growing wiser, children ever, rambling hand hand sunshine among flowery meadows, laying heads moss night, sweet sleep purity peace, buried birds dead! Some picture, real world it, bright light innocence, vague stars afar off, mind way. I glad think two guileless hearts Peggotty’s marriage little Them’ly’s mine. I glad think Loves Graces took airy forms homely procession. Well, came old boat good time night; Mr. Mrs. Barkis bade us good-bye, drove away snugly home. I felt then, first time, I lost Peggotty. I gone bed sore heart indeed roof sheltered little Them’ly’s head. Mr. Peggotty Ham knew thoughts well I did, ready supper hospitable faces drive away. Little Them’ly came sat beside locker time visit; altogether wonderful close wonderful day. It night tide; soon went bed, Mr. Peggotty Ham went fish. I felt brave left alone solitary house, protector Them’ly Mrs. Gummidge, wished lion serpent, ill-disposed monster, would make attack upon us, I might destroy him, cover glory. But nothing sort happened walking Yarmouth flats night, I provided best substitute I could dreaming dragons morning. With morning came Peggotty; called me, usual, window Mr. Barkis carrier first last dream too. After breakfast she took her home, beautiful little home was. Of moveables it, I must impressed certain old bureau dark wood parlour (the tile-floored kitchen general sitting-room), retreating top opened, let down, became desk, within large quarto edition Foxe’s Book Martyrs. This precious volume, I recollect one word, I immediately discovered immediately applied to; I never visited house afterwards, I kneeled chair, opened casket gem enshrined, spread arms desk, fell devouring book afresh. I chiefly edified, I afraid, pictures, numerous, represented kinds dismal horrors; Martyrs Peggotty’s house inseparable mind ever since, now. I took leave Mr. Peggotty, Ham, Mrs. Gummidge, little Them’ly, day; passed night Peggotty’s, little room roof (with Crocodile Book shelf bed’s head) always mine, Peggotty said, always kept exactly state. ‘Young old, Davy dear, long I alive house head,’ said Peggotty, ‘you shall find I expected directly minute. I shall keep every day, I used keep old little room, darling; go China, might think kept same, time away.’ I felt truth constancy dear old nurse, heart, thanked her well I could. That well, she spoke thus, her arms round neck, morning, I going home morning, I went home morning, herself Mr. Barkis cart. They left gate, easily lightly; strange sight see cart go on, taking Peggotty away, leaving old elm-trees looking house, face look mine love liking more. And I fell state neglect, I cannot look back upon without compassion. I fell solitary condition,--apart friendly notice, apart society boys age, apart companionship spiritless thoughts,--which seems cast gloom upon paper I write. What would I given, sent hardest school ever kept!--to taught something, anyhow, anywhere! No hope dawned upon me. They disliked me; sullenly, sternly, steadily, overlooked me. I think Mr. Murdstone’s means straitened time; little purpose. He could bear me; putting he tried, I believe, put away notion I claim upon him--and succeeded. I actively ill-used. I beaten, starved; wrong done intervals relenting, done systematic, passionless manner. Day day, week week, month month, I coldly neglected. I wonder sometimes, I think it, would done I taken illness; whether I lain lonely room, languished usual solitary way, whether anybody would helped out. When Mr. Miss Murdstone home, I took meals them; absence, I ate drank myself. At times I lounged house neighbourhood quite disregarded, except jealous making friends: thinking, perhaps, I did, I might complain someone. For reason, though Mr. Chillip often asked go see (he widower, having, years that, lost little small light-haired wife, I remember connecting thoughts pale tortoise-she will cat), seldom I enjoyed happiness passing afternoon his closet surgery; reading book new me, smell whole Pharmacopoeia coming nose, pounding something mortar his mild directions. For reason, added doubt old dislike her, I seldom allowed visit Peggotty. Faithful her promise, she either came see me, met somewhere near, every week, never empty-handed; many bitter disappointments I had, refused permission pay visit her her house. Some times, however, long intervals, I allowed go there; I found Mr. Barkis something miser, Peggotty dutifully expressed it, ‘a little near’, kept heap money box his bed, he pretended full coats trousers. In coffer, his riches hid tenacious modesty, smallest instalments could tempted artifice; Peggotty prepare long elaborate scheme, Gunpowder Plot, every Saturday’s expenses. All time I conscious waste promise I given, utterly neglected, I perfectly miserable, I doubt, old books. They comfort; I true me, read I do not know many times more. I approach period life, I never lose remembrance of, I remember anything: recollection often, without invocation, come like ghost, haunted happier times. I out, one day, loitering somewhere, listless, meditative manner way life engendered, when, turning corner lane near house, I came upon Mr. Murdstone walking gentleman. I confused, going them, gentleman cried: ‘What! Brooks!’ ‘No, sir, David Copperfield,’ I said. ‘Do not tell me. You Brooks,’ said gentleman. ‘You Brooks Sheffield. That is name.’ At words, I observed gentleman attentively. His laugh coming remembrance too, I knew Mr. Quinion, I gone Lowestoft Mr. Murdstone see, before--it matter--I need recall when. ‘And get on, educated, Brooks?’ said Mr. Quinion. He put his hand upon shoulder, turned about, walk them. I know reply, glanced dubiously Mr. Murdstone. ‘He home present,’ said latter. ‘He educated anywhere. I do not know him. He difficult subject.’ That old, double look moment; his eyes darkened frown, turned, aversion, elsewhere. ‘Humph!’ said Mr. Quinion, looking us both, I thought. ‘Fine weather!’ Silence ensued, I considering I could best disengage shoulder his hand, go away, he said: ‘I suppose pretty sharp fellow still? Eh, Brooks?’ ‘Aye! He sharp enough,’ said Mr. Murdstone, impatiently. ‘You better let go. He thank troubling him.’ On hint, Mr. Quinion released me, I made best way home. Looking back I turned front garden, I saw Mr. Murdstone leaning wicket churchyard, Mr. Quinion talking him. They looking me, I felt speaking me. Mr. Quinion lay house night. After breakfast, next morning, I put chair away, going room, Mr. Murdstone called back. He gravely repaired another table, his sister sat herself her desk. Mr. Quinion, his hands his pockets, stood looking window; I stood looking all. ‘David,’ said Mr. Murdstone, ‘to young world action; moping droning in.’ --‘As do,’ added his sister. ‘Jane Murdstone, leave me, please. I say, David, young world action, moping droning in. It especially young boy disposition, requires great deal correcting; greater service done force conform ways working world, bend break it.’ ‘For stubbornness will not here,’ said his sister ‘What wants is, crushed. And crushed must be. Shall be, too!’ He gave her look, half remonstrance, half approval, went on: ‘I suppose know, David, I rich. At rate, know now. You received considerable education already. Education costly; even not, I could afford it, I opinion would advantageous kept school. What you, fight world; sooner begin it, better.’ I think occurred I already begun it, poor way: occurs now, whether no. ‘You heard “counting-house” mentioned sometimes,’ said Mr. Murdstone. ‘The counting-house, sir?’ I repeated. ‘Of Murdstone Grinby, wine trade,’ he replied. I suppose I looked uncertain, he went hastily: ‘You heard “counting-house” mentioned, business, cellars, wharf, something it.’ ‘I think I heard business mentioned, sir,’ I said, remembering I vaguely knew his his sister’s resources. ‘But I do not know when.’ ‘It matter when,’ he returned. ‘Mr. Quinion manages business.’ I glanced latter deferentially he stood looking window. ‘Mr. Quinion suggests gives employment boys, he sees reason should not, terms, give employment you.’ ‘He having,’ Mr. Quinion observed low voice, half turning round, ‘no prospect, Murdstone.’ Mr. Murdstone, impatient, even angry gesture, resumed, without noticing he said: ‘Those terms are, earn enough provide eating drinking, pocket-money. Your lodging (which I arranged for) paid me. So washing--’ ‘--Which kept estimate,’ said his sister. ‘Your clothes looked you, too,’ said Mr. Murdstone; ‘as able, yet awhile, get yourself. So going London, David, Mr. Quinion, begin world account.’ ‘In short, provided for,’ observed his sister; ‘and please duty.’ Though I quite understood purpose announcement get rid me, I distinct remembrance whether pleased frightened me. My impression is, I state confusion it, and, oscillating two points, touched neither. Nor I much time clearing thoughts, Mr. Quinion go upon morrow. Behold me, morrow, much-worn little white hat, black crape round mother, black jacket, pair hard, stiff corduroy trousers--which Miss Murdstone considered best armour legs fight world come off. Behold attired, little worldly small trunk, sitting, lone lorn child (as Mrs. Gummidge might said), post-chaise carrying Mr. Quinion London coach Yarmouth! See, house church lessening distance; grave beneath tree blotted intervening objects; spire points upwards old playground more, sky empty! CHAPTER 11. I BEGIN LIFE ON MY OWN ACCOUNT, AND DO NOT LIKE IT I know enough world now, almost lost capacity much surprised anything; matter surprise me, even now, I easily thrown away age. A child excellent abilities, strong powers observation, quick, eager, delicate, soon hurt bodily mentally, seems wonderful nobody made sign behalf. But none made; I became, ten years old, little labouring hind service Murdstone Grinby. Murdstone Grinby’s warehouse waterside. It Blackfriars. Modern improvements altered place; last house bottom narrow street, curving hill river, stairs end, people took boat. It crazy old house wharf own, abutting water tide in, mud tide out, literally overrun rats. Its panelled rooms, discoloured dirt smoke hundred years, I dare say; decaying floors staircase; squeaking scuffling old grey rats cellars; dirt rottenness place; things, many years ago, mind, present instant. They me, evil hour I went among first time, trembling hand Mr. Quinion’s. Murdstone Grinby’s trade among good many kinds people, important branch supply wines spirits certain packet ships. I forget chiefly went, I think among made voyages East West Indies. I know great many empty bottles one consequences traffic, certain men boys employed examine light, reject flawed, rinse wash them. When empty bottles ran short, labels pasted full ones, corks fitted them, seals put upon corks, finished bottles packed casks. All work work, boys employed upon I one. There three four us, counting me. My working place established corner warehouse, Mr. Quinion could see me, he chose stand bottom rail his stool counting-house, look window desk. Hither, first morning auspiciously beginning life account, oldest regular boys summoned show business. His name Mick Walker, he wore ragged apron paper cap. He informed his father bargeman, walked, black velvet head-dress, Lord Mayor’s Show. He also informed principal associate would another boy he introduced the--to me--extraordinary name Mealy Potatoes. I discovered, however, youth christened name, bestowed upon warehouse, account his complexion, pale mealy. Mealy’s father waterman, additional distinction fireman, engaged one large theatres; young relation Mealy’s--I think his little sister--did Imps Pantomimes. No words express secret agony soul I sunk companionship; compared henceforth everyday associates happier childhood--not say Steerforth, Traddles, rest boys; felt hopes growing learned distinguished man, crushed bosom. The deep remembrance sense I had, utterly without hope now; shame I felt position; misery young heart believe day day I learned, thought, delighted in, raised fancy emulation by, would pass away me, little little, never brought back more; cannot written. As often Mick Walker went away course forenoon, I mingled tears water I washing bottles; sobbed flaw breast, danger bursting. The counting-house clock half past twelve, general preparation going dinner, Mr. Quinion tapped counting-house window, beckoned go in. I went in, found stoutish, middle-aged person, brown surtout black tights shoes, hair upon his head (which large one, shining) upon egg, extensive face, he turned full upon me. His clothes shabby, he imposing shirt-collar on. He carried jaunty sort stick, large pair rusty tassels it; quizzing-glass hung outside his coat,--for ornament, I afterwards found, he seldom looked it, could not see anything he did. ‘This,’ said Mr. Quinion, allusion myself, ‘is he.’ ‘This,’ said stranger, certain condescending roll his voice, certain indescribable air something genteel, impressed much, ‘is Master Copperfield. I hope I see well, sir?’ I said I well, hoped he was. I sufficiently ill ease, Heaven knows; nature complain much time life, I said I well, hoped he was. ‘I am,’ said stranger, ‘thank Heaven, quite well. I received letter Mr. Murdstone, he mentions he would desire receive apartment rear house, present unoccupied--and is, short, let a--in short,’ said stranger, smile burst confidence, ‘as bedroom--the young beginner I pleasure to--’ stranger waved his hand, settled his chin his shirt-collar. ‘This Mr. Micawber,’ said Mr. Quinion me. ‘Ahem!’ said stranger, ‘that name.’ ‘Mr. Micawber,’ said Mr. Quinion, ‘is known Mr. Murdstone. He takes orders us commission, he get any. He written Mr. Murdstone, subject lodgings, he receive lodger.’ ‘My address,’ said Mr. Micawber, ‘is Windsor Terrace, City Road. I--in short,’ said Mr. Micawber, genteel air, another burst confidence--‘I live there.’ I made bow. ‘Under impression,’ said Mr. Micawber, ‘that peregrinations metropolis yet extensive, might difficulty penetrating arcana Modern Babylon direction City Road,--in short,’ said Mr. Micawber, another burst confidence, ‘that might lose yourself--I shall happy call evening, install knowledge nearest way.’ I thanked heart, friendly offer take trouble. ‘At hour,’ said Mr. Micawber, ‘shall I--’ ‘At eight,’ said Mr. Quinion. ‘At eight,’ said Mr. Micawber. ‘I beg wish good day, Mr. Quinion. I intrude longer.’ So he put his hat, went his cane his arm: upright, humming tune he clear counting-house. Mr. Quinion formally engaged useful I could warehouse Murdstone Grinby, salary, I think, six shillings week. I clear whether six seven. I inclined believe, uncertainty head, six first seven afterwards. He paid week (from his pocket, I believe), I gave Mealy sixpence get trunk carried Windsor Terrace night: heavy strength, small was. I paid sixpence dinner, meat pie turn neighbouring pump; passed hour allowed meal, walking streets. At appointed time evening, Mr. Micawber reappeared. I washed hands face, greater honour his gentility, walked house, I suppose I must call it, together; Mr. Micawber impressing name streets, shapes corner houses upon me, went along, I might find way back, easily, morning. Arrived house Windsor Terrace (which I noticed shabby like himself, also, like himself, made show could), he presented Mrs. Micawber, thin faded lady, young, sitting parlour (the first floor altogether unfurnished, blinds kept delude neighbours), baby her breast. This baby one twins; I may remark I hardly ever, experience family, saw twins detached Mrs. Micawber time. One always taking refreshment. There two children; Master Micawber, aged four, Miss Micawber, aged three. These, dark-complexioned young woman, habit snorting, servant family, informed me, half hour expired, she ‘a Orfling’, came St. Luke’s workhouse, neighbourhood, completed establishment. My room top house, back: close chamber; stencilled ornament young imagination represented blue muffin; scantily furnished. ‘I never thought,’ said Mrs. Micawber, she came up, twin all, show apartment, sat take breath, ‘before I married, I lived papa mama, I ever find necessary take lodger. But Mr. Micawber difficulties, considerations private feeling must give way.’ I said: ‘Yes, madam.’ ‘Mr. Micawber’s difficulties almost overwhelming present,’ said Mrs. Micawber; ‘and whether possible bring them, I do not know. When I lived home papa mama, I really hardly understood word meant, sense I employ it, experientia it,--as papa used say.’ I cannot satisfy whether she told Mr. Micawber officer Marines, whether I imagined it. I know I believe hour he WAS Marines upon time, without knowing why. He sort town traveller number miscellaneous houses, now; made little nothing it, I afraid. ‘If Mr. Micawber’s creditors give time,’ said Mrs. Micawber, ‘they must take consequences; sooner bring issue better. Blood cannot obtained stone, neither anything account obtained present (not mention law expenses) Mr. Micawber.’ I never quite understand whether precocious self-dependence confused Mrs. Micawber reference age, whether she full subject she would talked twins nobody else communicate with, strain she began, she went accordingly time I knew her. Poor Mrs. Micawber! She said she tried exert herself, so, I doubt, she had. The centre street door perfectly covered great brass-plate, engraved ‘Mrs. Micawber’s Boarding Establishment Young Ladies’: I never found young lady ever school there; young lady ever came, proposed come; least preparation ever made receive young lady. The visitors I ever saw, heard of, creditors. THEY used come hours, quite ferocious. One dirty-faced man, I think he boot-maker, used edge passage early seven of the clock morning, call stairs Mr. Micawber--‘Come! You are not yet, know. Pay us, you? Do not hide, know; that is mean. I would not mean I you. Pay us, you? You pay us, d’ye hear? Come!’ Receiving answer taunts, he would mount his wrath words ‘swindlers’ ‘robbers’; ineffectual too, would sometimes go extremity crossing street, roaring windows second floor, he knew Mr. Micawber was. At times, Mr. Micawber would transported grief mortification, even length (as I made aware scream his wife) making motions razor; within half-an-hour afterwards, he would polish his shoes extraordinary pains, go out, humming tune greater air gentility ever. Mrs. Micawber quite elastic. I known her thrown fainting fits king’s taxes three of the clock, eat lamb chops, breaded, drink warm ale (paid two tea-spoons gone pawnbroker’s) four. On one occasion, execution put in, coming home chance early six of the clock, I saw her lying (of course twin) grate swoon, her hair torn her face; I never knew her cheerful she was, night, veal cutlet kitchen fire, telling stories her papa mama, company used keep. In house, family, I passed leisure time. My exclusive breakfast penny loaf pennyworth milk, I provided myself. I kept another small loaf, modicum cheese, particular shelf particular cupboard, make supper I came back night. This made hole six seven shillings, I know well; I warehouse day, support money week. From Monday morning Saturday night, I advice, counsel, encouragement, consolation, assistance, support, kind, anyone, I call mind, I hope go heaven! I young childish, little qualified--how could I otherwise?--to undertake whole charge existence, often, going Murdstone Grinby’s, morning, I could resist stale pastry put sale half-price pastrycooks’ doors, spent money I kept dinner. Then, I went without dinner, bought roll slice pudding. I remember two pudding shops, I divided, according finances. One court close St. Martin’s Church--at back church,--which removed altogether. The pudding shop made currants, rather special pudding, dear, twopennyworth larger pennyworth ordinary pudding. A good shop latter Strand--somewhere part rebuilt since. It stout pale pudding, heavy flabby, great flat raisins it, stuck whole wide distances apart. It came hot time every day, many day I dine it. When I dined regularly handsomely, I saveloy penny loaf, fourpenny plate red beef cook’s shop; plate bread cheese glass beer, miserable old public-house opposite place business, called Lion, Lion something else I forgotten. Once, I remember carrying bread (which I brought home morning) arm, wrapped piece paper, like book, going famous alamode beef-house near Drury Lane, ordering ‘small plate’ delicacy eat it. What waiter thought strange little apparition coming alone, I do not know; I see now, staring I ate dinner, bringing waiter look. I gave halfpenny himself, I wish he had not taken it. We half-an-hour, I think, tea. When I money enough, I used get half-a-pint ready-made coffee slice bread butter. When I none, I used look venison shop Fleet Street; I strolled, time, far Covent Garden Market, stared pineapples. I fond wandering Adelphi, mysterious place, dark arches. I see emerging one evening arches, little public-house close river, open space it, coal-heavers dancing; look I sat upon bench. I wonder thought me! I child, little, frequently I went bar strange public-house glass ale porter, moisten I dinner, afraid give me. I remember one hot evening I went bar public-house, said landlord: ‘What best--your best--ale glass?’ For special occasion. I do not know what. It may birthday. ‘Twopence-halfpenny,’ says landlord, ‘is price Genuine Stunning ale.’ ‘Then,’ says I, producing money, ‘just draw glass Genuine Stunning, please, good head it.’ The landlord looked return bar, head foot, strange smile his face; instead drawing beer, looked round screen said something his wife. She came behind it, her work her hand, joined surveying me. Here stand, three, now. The landlord his shirt-sleeves, leaning bar window-frame; his wife looking little half-door; I, confusion, looking outside partition. They asked good many questions; as, name was, old I was, I lived, I employed, I came there. To which, I might commit nobody, I invented, I afraid, appropriate answers. They served ale, though I suspect Genuine Stunning; landlord’s wife, opening little half-door bar, bending down, gave money back, gave kiss half admiring half compassionate, womanly good, I sure. I know I exaggerate, unconsciously unintentionally, scantiness resources difficulties life. I know shilling given Mr. Quinion time, I spent dinner tea. I know I worked, morning night, common men boys, shabby child. I know I lounged streets, insufficiently unsatisfactorily fed. I know that, mercy God, I might easily been, care taken me, little robber little vagabond. Yet I held station Murdstone Grinby’s too. Besides Mr. Quinion careless man occupied, dealing thing anomalous, could, treat one upon different footing rest, I never said, man boy, I came there, gave least indication sorry I there. That I suffered secret, I suffered exquisitely, one ever knew I. How much I suffered, is, I said already, utterly beyond power tell. But I kept counsel, I work. I knew first, that, I could work well rest, I could hold slight contempt. I soon became least expeditious skilful either boys. Though perfectly familiar them, conduct manner different enough place space us. They men generally spoke ‘the little gent’, ‘the young Suffolker.’ A certain man named Gregory, foreman packers, another named Tipp, carman, wore red jacket, used address sometimes ‘David’: I think mostly confidential, I made efforts entertain them, work, results old readings; fast perishing remembrance. Mealy Potatoes uprose once, rebelled distinguished; Mick Walker settled time. My rescue kind existence I considered quite hopeless, abandoned, such, altogether. I solemnly convinced I never one hour reconciled it, otherwise miserably unhappy; I bore it; even Peggotty, partly love her partly shame, never letter (though many passed us) revealed truth. Mr. Micawber’s difficulties addition distressed state mind. In forlorn state I became quite attached family, used walk about, busy Mrs. Micawber’s calculations ways means, heavy weight Mr. Micawber’s debts. On Saturday night, grand treat,--partly great thing walk home six seven shillings pocket, looking shops thinking sum would buy, partly I went home early,--Mrs. Micawber would make heart-rending confidences me; also Sunday morning, I mixed portion tea coffee I bought over-night, little shaving-pot, sat late breakfast. It nothing unusual Mr. Micawber sob violently beginning one Saturday night conversations, sing Jack’s delight his lovely Nan, towards end it. I known come home supper flood tears, declaration nothing left jail; go bed making calculation expense putting bow-windows house, ‘in case anything turned up’, his favourite expression. And Mrs. Micawber same. A curious equality friendship, originating, I suppose, respective circumstances, sprung people, notwithstanding ludicrous disparity years. But I never allowed prevailed upon accept invitation eat drink stock (knowing got badly butcher baker, often much themselves), Mrs. Micawber took her entire confidence. This she one evening follows: ‘Master Copperfield,’ said Mrs. Micawber, ‘I make stranger you, therefore hesitate say Mr. Micawber’s difficulties coming crisis.’ It made miserable hear it, I looked Mrs. Micawber’s red eyes utmost sympathy. ‘With exception heel Dutch cheese--which adapted wants young family’--said Mrs. Micawber, ‘there really scrap anything larder. I accustomed speak larder I lived papa mama, I use word almost unconsciously. What I mean express is, nothing eat house.’ ‘Dear me!’ I said, great concern. I two three shillings week’s money pocket--from I presume must Wednesday night held conversation--and I hastily produced them, heartfelt emotion begged Mrs. Micawber accept loan. But lady, kissing me, making put back pocket, replied she could not think it. ‘No, dear Master Copperfield,’ said she, ‘far thoughts! But discretion beyond years, render another kind service, will; service I thankfully accept of.’ I begged Mrs. Micawber name it. ‘I parted plate myself,’ said Mrs. Micawber. ‘Six tea, two salt, pair sugars, I different times borrowed money on, secret, hands. But twins great tie; me, recollections, papa mama, transactions painful. There still trifles could part with. Mr. Micawber’s feelings would never allow dispose them; Clickett’--this girl workhouse--‘being vulgar mind, would take painful liberties much confidence reposed her. Master Copperfield, I might ask you--’ I understood Mrs. Micawber now, begged her make use extent. I began dispose portable articles property evening; went similar expedition almost every morning, I went Murdstone Grinby’s. Mr. Micawber books little chiffonier, he called library; went first. I carried them, one another, bookstall City Road--one part which, near house, almost bookstalls bird shops then--and sold whatever would bring. The keeper bookstall, lived little house behind it, used get tipsy every night, violently scolded his wife every morning. More once, I went early, I audience turn-up bedstead, cut his forehead black eye, bearing witness his excesses over-night (I afraid he quarrelsome his drink), he, shaking hand, endeavouring find needful shillings one pockets his clothes, lay upon floor, his wife, baby her arms her shoes heel, never left rating him. Sometimes he lost his money, he would ask call again; his wife always got some--had taken his, I dare say, he drunk--and secretly completed bargain stairs, went together. At pawnbroker’s shop, too, I began well known. The principal gentleman officiated behind counter, took good deal notice me; often got me, I recollect, decline Latin noun adjective, conjugate Latin verb, his ear, he transacted business. After occasions Mrs. Micawber made little treat, generally supper; peculiar relish meals I well remember. At last Mr. Micawber’s difficulties came crisis, he arrested early one morning, carried King’s Bench Prison Borough. He told me, he went house, God day gone upon him--and I really thought his heart broken mine too. But I heard, afterwards, he seen play lively game skittles, noon. On first Sunday he taken there, I go see him, dinner him. I ask way place, short place I see another place, short I see yard, I cross, keep straight I saw turnkey. All I did; last I see turnkey (poor little fellow I was!), thought how, Roderick Random debtors’ prison, man nothing old rug, turnkey swam dimmed eyes beating heart. Mr. Micawber waiting within gate, went his room (top story one), cried much. He solemnly conjured me, I remember, take warning his fate; observe man twenty pounds a-year his income, spent nineteen pounds nineteen shillings sixpence, he would happy, he spent twenty pounds one he would miserable. After he borrowed shilling porter, gave written order Mrs. Micawber amount, put away his pocket-handkerchief, cheered up. We sat little fire, two bricks put within rusted grate, one side, prevent burning many coals; another debtor, shared room Mr. Micawber, came bakehouse loin mutton joint-stock repast. Then I sent ‘Captain Hopkins’ room overhead, Mr. Micawber’s compliments, I his young friend, would Captain Hopkins lend knife fork. Captain Hopkins lent knife fork, his compliments Mr. Micawber. There dirty lady his little room, two wan girls, his daughters, shock heads hair. I thought better borrow Captain Hopkins’s knife fork, Captain Hopkins’s comb. The Captain last extremity shabbiness, large whiskers, old, old brown great-coat coat it. I saw his bed rolled corner; plates dishes pots he had, shelf; I divined (God knows how) though two girls shock heads hair Captain Hopkins’s children, dirty lady married Captain Hopkins. My timid station his threshold occupied couple minutes most; I came knowledge, surely knife fork hand. There something gipsy-like agreeable dinner, all. I took back Captain Hopkins’s knife fork early afternoon, went home comfort Mrs. Micawber account visit. She fainted she saw return, made little jug egg-hot afterwards console us talked over. I do not know household furniture came sold family benefit, sold it, except I not. Sold was, however, carried away van; except bed, chairs, kitchen table. With possessions encamped, were, two parlours emptied house Windsor Terrace; Mrs. Micawber, children, Orfling, myself; lived rooms night day. I idea long, though seems long time. At last Mrs. Micawber resolved move prison, Mr. Micawber secured room himself. So I took key house landlord, glad get it; beds sent King’s Bench, except mine, little room hired outside walls neighbourhood Institution, much satisfaction, since Micawbers I become used one another, troubles, part. The Orfling likewise accommodated inexpensive lodging neighbourhood. Mine quiet back-garret sloping roof, commanding pleasant prospect timberyard; I took possession it, reflection Mr. Micawber’s troubles come crisis last, I thought quite paradise. All time I working Murdstone Grinby’s common way, common companions, sense unmerited degradation first. But I never, happily doubt, made single acquaintance, spoke many boys I saw daily going warehouse, coming it, prowling streets meal-times. I led secretly unhappy life; I led lonely, self-reliant manner. The changes I conscious are, firstly, I grown shabby, secondly, I relieved much weight Mr. Mrs. Micawber’s cares; relatives friends engaged help present pass, lived comfortably prison lived long it. I used breakfast now, virtue arrangement, I forgotten details. I forget, too, hour gates opened morning, admitting going in; I know I often six of the clock, favourite lounging-place interval old London Bridge, I will not sit one stone recesses, watching people going by, look balustrades sun shining water, lighting golden flame top Monument. The Orfling met sometimes, told astonishing fictions respecting wharves Tower; I say I hope I believed myself. In evening I used go back prison, walk parade Mr. Micawber; play casino Mrs. Micawber, hear reminiscences her papa mama. Whether Mr. Murdstone knew I was, I unable say. I never told Murdstone Grinby’s. Mr. Micawber’s affairs, although past crisis, much involved reason certain ‘Deed’, I used hear great deal, I suppose, now, former composition his creditors, though I far clear then, I conscious confounded demoniacal parchments held have, upon time, obtained great extent Germany. At last document appeared got way, somehow; events ceased rock-ahead been; Mrs. Micawber informed ‘her family’ decided Mr. Micawber apply his release Insolvent Debtors Act, would set free, she expected, six weeks. ‘And then,’ said Mr. Micawber, present, ‘I doubt I shall, please Heaven, begin beforehand world, live perfectly new manner, if--in short, anything turns up.’ By way going anything might cards, I call mind Mr. Micawber, time, composed petition House Commons, praying alteration law imprisonment debt. I set remembrance here, instance manner I fitted old books altered life, made stories myself, streets, men women; main points character I shall unconsciously develop, I suppose, writing life, gradually forming while. There club prison, Mr. Micawber, gentleman, great authority. Mr. Micawber stated his idea petition club, club strongly approved same. Wherefore Mr. Micawber (who thoroughly good-natured man, active creature everything his affairs ever existed, never happy he busy something could never profit him) set work petition, invented it, engrossed immense sheet paper, spread table, appointed time club, within walls chose, come his room sign it. When I heard approaching ceremony, I anxious see come in, one another, though I knew greater part already, me, I got hour’s leave absence Murdstone Grinby’s, established corner purpose. As many principal members club could got small room without filling it, supported Mr. Micawber front petition, old friend Captain Hopkins (who washed himself, honour solemn occasion) stationed close it, read unacquainted contents. The door thrown open, general population began come in, long file: several waiting outside, one entered, affixed his signature, went out. To everybody succession, Captain Hopkins said: ‘Have read it?’--‘No.’---‘Would like hear read?’ If he weakly showed least disposition hear it, Captain Hopkins, loud sonorous voice, gave every word it. The Captain would read twenty thousand times, twenty thousand people would heard him, one one. I remember certain luscious roll he gave phrases ‘The people’s representatives Parliament assembled,’ ‘Your petitioners therefore humbly approach honourable house,’ ‘His gracious Majesty’s unfortunate subjects,’ words something real his mouth, delicious taste; Mr. Micawber, meanwhile, listening little author’s vanity, contemplating (not severely) spikes opposite wall. As I walked fro daily Southwark Blackfriars, lounged meal-times obscure streets, stones may, anything I know, worn moment childish feet, I wonder many people wanting crowd used come filing review again, echo Captain Hopkins’s voice! When thoughts go back, now, slow agony youth, I wonder much histories I invented people hangs like mist fancy well-remembered facts! When I tread old ground, I wonder I seem see pity, going me, innocent romantic boy, making his imaginative world strange experiences sordid things! CHAPTER 12. LIKING LIFE ON MY OWN ACCOUNT NO BETTER, I FORM A GREAT RESOLUTION In due time, Mr. Micawber’s petition ripe hearing; gentleman ordered discharged Act, great joy. His creditors implacable; Mrs. Micawber informed even revengeful boot-maker declared open court he bore malice, money owing he liked paid. He said he thought human nature. Mr. Micawber returned King’s Bench his case over, fees settled, formalities observed, he could actually released. The club received transport, held harmonic meeting evening his honour; Mrs. Micawber I lamb’s fry private, surrounded sleeping family. ‘On occasion I give you, Master Copperfield,’ said Mrs. Micawber, ‘in little flip,’ already, ‘the memory papa mama.’ ‘Are dead, madam?’ I inquired, drinking toast wine-glass. ‘My mama departed life,’ said Mrs. Micawber, ‘before Mr. Micawber’s difficulties commenced, least became pressing. My papa lived bail Mr. Micawber several times, expired, regretted numerous circle.’ Mrs. Micawber shook her head, dropped pious tear upon twin happened hand. As I could hardly hope favourable opportunity putting question I near interest, I said Mrs. Micawber: ‘May I ask, madam, Mr. Micawber intend do, Mr. Micawber his difficulties, liberty? Have settled yet?’ ‘My family,’ said Mrs. Micawber, always said two words air, though I never could discover came denomination, ‘my family opinion Mr. Micawber quit London, exert his talents country. Mr. Micawber man great talent, Master Copperfield.’ I said I sure that. ‘Of great talent,’ repeated Mrs. Micawber. ‘My family opinion, that, little interest, something might done man his ability Custom House. The influence family local, wish Mr. Micawber go Plymouth. They think indispensable he upon spot.’ ‘That he may ready?’ I suggested. ‘Exactly,’ returned Mrs. Micawber. ‘That he may ready--in case anything turning up.’ ‘And go too, madam?’ The events day, combination twins, flip, made Mrs. Micawber hysterical, she she would tears she replied: ‘I never desert Mr. Micawber. Mr. Micawber may concealed his difficulties first instance, his sanguine temper may led expect he would overcome them. The pearl necklace bracelets I inherited mama, disposed less half value; set coral, wedding gift papa, actually thrown away nothing. But I never desert Mr. Micawber. No!’ cried Mrs. Micawber, affected before, ‘I never it! It is use asking me!’ I felt quite uncomfortable--as Mrs. Micawber supposed I asked her anything sort!--and sat looking her alarm. ‘Mr. Micawber his faults. I deny he improvident. I deny he kept dark his resources his liabilities both,’ she went on, looking wall; ‘but I never desert Mr. Micawber!’ Mrs. Micawber raised her voice perfect scream, I frightened I ran club-room, disturbed Mr. Micawber act presiding long table, leading chorus Gee up, Dobbin, Gee ho, Dobbin, Gee up, Dobbin, Gee up, gee ho--o--o! tidings Mrs. Micawber alarming state, upon he immediately burst tears, came away his waistcoat full heads tails shrimps, he partaking. ‘Emma, angel!’ cried Mr. Micawber, running room; ‘what matter?’ ‘I never desert you, Micawber!’ she exclaimed. ‘My life!’ said Mr. Micawber, taking her his arms. ‘I perfectly aware it.’ ‘He parent children! He father twins! He husband affections,’ cried Mrs. Micawber, struggling; ‘and I ne--ver--will--desert Mr. Micawber!’ Mr. Micawber deeply affected proof her devotion (as me, I dissolved tears), he hung her passionate manner, imploring her look up, calm. But he asked Mrs. Micawber look up, she fixed her eyes nothing; he asked her compose herself, she would not. Consequently Mr. Micawber soon overcome, he mingled his tears mine; he begged favour taking chair staircase, he got her bed. I would taken leave night, he would hear strangers’ bell ring. So I sat staircase window, he came another chair joined me. ‘How Mrs. Micawber now, sir?’ I said. ‘Very low,’ said Mr. Micawber, shaking his head; ‘reaction. Ah, dreadful day! We stand alone now--everything gone us!’ Mr. Micawber pressed hand, groaned, afterwards she would tears. I greatly touched, disappointed too, I expected quite gay happy long-looked-for occasion. But Mr. Mrs. Micawber used old difficulties, I think, felt quite shipwrecked came consider released them. All elasticity departed, I never saw half wretched night; insomuch bell rang, Mr. Micawber walked lodge, parted blessing, I felt quite afraid leave himself, he profoundly miserable. But confusion lowness spirits been, unexpectedly me, involved, I plainly discerned Mr. Mrs. Micawber family going away London, parting us near hand. It walk home night, sleepless hours followed I lay bed, thought first occurred me--though I do not know came head--which afterwards shaped settled resolution. I grown accustomed Micawbers, intimate distresses, utterly friendless without them, prospect thrown upon new shift lodging, going among unknown people, like moment turned adrift present life, knowledge ready made experience given me. All sensitive feelings wounded cruelly, shame misery kept alive within breast, became poignant I thought this; I determined life unendurable. That hope escape it, unless escape act, I knew quite well. I rarely heard Miss Murdstone, never Mr. Murdstone: two three parcels made mended clothes come me, consigned Mr. Quinion, scrap paper effect J. M. trusted D. C. applying business, devoting wholly his duties--not least hint ever anything else common drudge I fast settling down. The next day showed me, mind first agitation conceived, Mrs. Micawber spoken going away without warrant. They took lodging house I lived, week; expiration time start Plymouth. Mr. Micawber came counting-house, afternoon, tell Mr. Quinion he must relinquish day his departure, give high character, I sure I deserved. And Mr. Quinion, calling Tipp carman, married man, room let, quartered prospectively him--by mutual consent, he every reason think; I said nothing, though resolution taken. I passed evenings Mr. Mrs. Micawber, remaining term residence roof; I think became fonder one another time went on. On last Sunday, invited dinner; loin pork apple sauce, pudding. I bought spotted wooden horse over-night parting gift little Wilkins Micawber--that boy--and doll little Emma. I also bestowed shilling Orfling, disbanded. We pleasant day, though tender state approaching separation. ‘I shall never, Master Copperfield,’ said Mrs. Micawber, ‘revert period Mr. Micawber difficulties, without thinking you. Your conduct always delicate obliging description. You never lodger. You friend.’ ‘My dear,’ said Mr. Micawber; ‘Copperfield,’ he accustomed call me, late, ‘has heart feel distresses his fellow-creatures behind cloud, head plan, hand to--in short, general ability dispose available property could made away with.’ I expressed sense commendation, said I sorry going lose one another. ‘My dear young friend,’ said Mr. Micawber, ‘I older you; man experience life, and--and experience, short, difficulties, generally speaking. At present, something turns (which I am, I may say, hourly expecting), I nothing bestow advice. Still advice far worth taking, that--in short, I never taken myself, the’--here Mr. Micawber, beaming smiling, his head face, present moment, checked frowned--‘the miserable wretch behold.’ ‘My dear Micawber!’ urged his wife. ‘I say,’ returned Mr. Micawber, quite forgetting himself, smiling again, ‘the miserable wretch behold. My advice is, never tomorrow today. Procrastination thief time. Collar him!’ ‘My poor papa’s maxim,’ Mrs. Micawber observed. ‘My dear,’ said Mr. Micawber, ‘your papa well his way, Heaven forbid I disparage him. Take all, never shall--in short, make acquaintance, probably, anybody else possessing, his time life, legs gaiters, able read description print, without spectacles. But he applied maxim marriage, dear; far prematurely entered into, consequence, I never recovered expense.’ Mr. Micawber looked aside Mrs. Micawber, added: ‘Not I sorry it. Quite contrary, love.’ After which, he grave minute so. ‘My piece advice, Copperfield,’ said Mr. Micawber, ‘you know. Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure nineteen nineteen six, result happiness. Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure twenty pounds ought six, result misery. The blossom blighted, leaf withered, god day goes upon dreary scene, and--and short ever floored. As I am!’ To make his example impressive, Mr. Micawber drank glass punch air great enjoyment satisfaction, whistled College Hornpipe. I fail assure I would store precepts mind, though indeed I need so, for, time, affected visibly. Next morning I met whole family coach office, saw them, desolate heart, take places outside, back. ‘Master Copperfield,’ said Mrs. Micawber, ‘God bless you! I never forget that, know, I never would I could.’ ‘Copperfield,’ said Mr. Micawber, ‘farewell! Every happiness prosperity! If, progress revolving years, I could persuade blighted destiny warning you, I feel I occupied another man’s place existence altogether vain. In case anything turning (of I rather confident), I shall extremely happy power improve prospects.’ I think, Mrs. Micawber sat back coach, children, I stood road looking wistfully them, mist cleared her eyes, she saw little creature I really was. I think so, she beckoned climb up, quite new motherly expression her face, put her arm round neck, gave kiss she might given her boy. I barely time get coach started, I could hardly see family handkerchiefs waved. It gone minute. The Orfling I stood looking vacantly middle road, shook hands said good-bye; she going back, I suppose, St. Luke’s workhouse, I went begin weary day Murdstone Grinby’s. But intention passing many weary days there. No. I resolved run away.---To go, means other, country, relation I world, tell story aunt, Miss Betsey. I already observed I do not know desperate idea came brain. But, there, remained there; hardened purpose I never entertained determined purpose life. I far sure I believed anything hopeful it, mind thoroughly made must carried execution. Again, again, hundred times again, since night thought first occurred banished sleep, I gone old story poor mother’s birth, one great delights old time hear her tell, I knew heart. My aunt walked story, walked it, dread awful personage; one little trait her behaviour I liked dwell on, gave faint shadow encouragement. I could forget mother thought she felt her touch her pretty hair ungentle hand; though might altogether mother’s fancy, might foundation whatever fact, I made little picture, it, terrible aunt relenting towards girlish beauty I recollected well loved much, softened whole narrative. It possible mind long time, gradually engendered determination. As I even know Miss Betsey lived, I wrote long letter Peggotty, asked her, incidentally, she remembered; pretending I heard lady living certain place I named random, curiosity know same. In course letter, I told Peggotty I particular occasion half guinea; she could lend sum I could repay it, I much obliged her, would tell her afterwards I wanted for. Peggotty’s answer soon arrived, was, usual, full affectionate devotion. She enclosed half guinea (I afraid she must world trouble get Mr. Barkis’s box), told Miss Betsey lived near Dover, whether Dover itself, Hythe, Sandgate, Folkestone, she could say. One men, however, informing asking places, close together, I deemed enough object, resolved set end week. Being honest little creature, unwilling disgrace memory I going leave behind Murdstone Grinby’s, I considered bound remain Saturday night; and, I paid week’s wages advance I first came there, present counting-house usual hour, receive stipend. For express reason, I borrowed half-guinea, I might without fund travelling-expenses. Accordingly, Saturday night came, waiting warehouse paid, Tipp carman, always took precedence, went first draw his money, I shook Mick Walker hand; asked him, came his turn paid, say Mr. Quinion I gone move box Tipp’s; and, bidding last good night Mealy Potatoes, ran away. My box old lodging, water, I written direction back one address cards nailed casks: ‘Master David, left till called for, Coach Office, Dover.’ This I pocket ready put box, I got house; I went towards lodging, I looked someone would help carry booking-office. There long-legged young man little empty donkey-cart, standing near Obelisk, Blackfriars Road, whose eye I caught I going by, who, addressing ‘Sixpenn’orth bad ha’pence,’ hoped ‘I know agin swear to’--in allusion, I doubt, staring him. I stopped assure I done bad manners, uncertain whether he might might like job. ‘Wot job?’ said long-legged young man. ‘To move box,’ I answered. ‘Wot box?’ said long-legged young man. I told mine, street there, I wanted take Dover coach office sixpence. ‘Done tanner!’ said long-legged young man, directly got upon his cart, nothing large wooden tray wheels, rattled away rate, much I could keep pace donkey. There defiant manner young man, particularly way he chewed straw he spoke me, I much like; bargain made, however, I took upstairs room I leaving, brought box down, put his cart. Now, I unwilling put direction-card there, lest landlord’s family fathom I doing, detain me; I said young man I would glad he would stop minute, he came dead-wall King’s Bench prison. The words sooner mouth, he rattled away he, box, cart, donkey, equally mad; I quite breath running calling him, I caught place appointed. Being much flushed excited, I tumbled half-guinea pocket pulling card out. I put mouth safety, though hands trembled good deal, tied card much satisfaction, I felt violently chucked chin long-legged young man, saw half-guinea fly mouth his hand. ‘Wot!’ said young man, seizing jacket collar, frightful grin. ‘This pollis case, it? You are a-going bolt, you? Come pollis, young warmin, come pollis!’ ‘You give money back, please,’ said I, much frightened; ‘and leave alone.’ ‘Come pollis!’ said young man. ‘You shall prove yourn pollis.’ ‘Give box money, you,’ I cried, bursting tears. The young man still replied: ‘Come pollis!’ dragging donkey violent manner, affinity animal magistrate, he changed his mind, jumped cart, sat upon box, and, exclaiming he would drive pollis straight, rattled away harder ever. I ran fast I could, I breath call with, dared call out, now, I had. I narrowly escaped run over, twenty times least, half mile. Now I lost him, I saw him, I lost him, I cut whip, shouted at, mud, again, running somebody is arms, running headlong post. At length, confused fright heat, doubting whether half London might time turning apprehension, I left young man go he would box money; and, panting crying, never stopping, faced Greenwich, I understood Dover Road: taking little world, towards retreat aunt, Miss Betsey, I brought it, night arrival gave her much umbrage. CHAPTER 13. THE SEQUEL OF MY RESOLUTION For anything I know, I may wild idea running way Dover, I gave pursuit young man donkey-cart, started Greenwich. My scattered senses soon collected point, I had; I came stop Kent Road, terrace piece water it, great foolish image middle, blowing dry she will. Here I sat doorstep, quite spent exhausted efforts I already made, hardly breath enough cry loss box half-guinea. It time dark; I heard clocks strike ten, I sat resting. But summer night, fortunately, fine weather. When I recovered breath, got rid stifling sensation throat, I rose went on. In midst distress, I notion going back. I doubt I any, though Swiss snow-drift Kent Road. But standing possessed three-halfpence world (and I sure I wonder came left pocket Saturday night!) troubled none less I went on. I began picture myself, scrap newspaper intelligence, found dead day two, hedge; I trudged miserably, though fast I could, I happened pass little shop, written ladies’ gentlemen’s wardrobes bought, best price given rags, bones, kitchen-stuff. The master shop sitting door his shirt-sleeves, smoking; great many coats pairs trousers dangling low ceiling, two feeble candles burning inside show were, I fancied he looked like man revengeful disposition, hung his enemies, enjoying himself. My late experiences Mr. Mrs. Micawber suggested might means keeping wolf little while. I went next by-street, took waistcoat, rolled neatly arm, came back shop door. ‘If please, sir,’ I said, ‘I sell fair price.’ Mr. Dolloby--Dolloby name shop door, least--took waistcoat, stood his pipe head, door-post, went shop, followed me, snuffed two candles his fingers, spread waistcoat counter, looked there, held light, looked there, ultimately said: ‘What call price, now, little weskit?’ ‘Oh! know best, sir,’ I returned modestly. ‘I cannot buyer seller too,’ said Mr. Dolloby. ‘Put price little weskit.’ ‘Would eighteenpence be?’--I hinted, hesitation. Mr. Dolloby rolled again, gave back. ‘I rob family,’ he said, ‘if I offer ninepence it.’ This disagreeable way putting business; imposed upon me, perfect stranger, unpleasantness asking Mr. Dolloby rob his family account. My circumstances pressing, however, I said I would take ninepence it, he pleased. Mr. Dolloby, without grumbling, gave ninepence. I wished good night, walked shop richer sum, poorer waistcoat. But I buttoned jacket, much. Indeed, I foresaw pretty clearly jacket would go next, I make best way Dover shirt pair trousers, might deem lucky I got even trim. But mind run much might supposed. Beyond general impression distance me, young man donkey-cart used cruelly, I think I urgent sense difficulties I set ninepence pocket. A plan occurred passing night, I going carry execution. This was, lie behind wall back old school, corner used haystack. I imagined would kind company boys, bedroom I used tell stories, near me: although boys would know nothing there, bedroom would yield shelter. I hard day’s work, pretty well jaded I came climbing out, last, upon level Blackheath. It cost trouble find Salem House; I found it, I found haystack corner, I lay it; first walked round wall, looked windows, seen dark silent within. Never shall I forget lonely sensation first lying down, without roof head! Sleep came upon came many outcasts, house-doors locked, house-dogs barked, night--and I dreamed lying old school-bed, talking boys room; found sitting upright, Steerforth’s name upon lips, looking wildly stars glistening glimmering me. When I remembered I untimely hour, feeling stole upon made get up, afraid I do not know what, walk about. But fainter glimmering stars, pale light sky day coming, reassured me: eyes heavy, I lay slept--though knowledge sleep cold--until warm beams sun, ringing getting-up bell Salem House, awoke me. If I could hoped Steerforth there, I would lurked he came alone; I knew he must left long since. Traddles still remained, perhaps, doubtful; I sufficient confidence his discretion good luck, however strong reliance his good nature, wish trust situation. So I crept away wall Mr. Creakle’s boys getting up, struck long dusty track I first known Dover Road I one them, I little expected eyes would ever see wayfarer I now, upon it. What different Sunday morning old Sunday morning Yarmouth! In due time I heard church-bells ringing, I plodded on; I met people going church; I passed church two congregation inside, sound singing came sunshine, beadle sat cooled shade porch, stood beneath yew-tree, his hand his forehead, glowering going by. But peace rest old Sunday morning everything, except me. That difference. I felt quite wicked dirt dust, tangled hair. But quiet picture I conjured up, mother her youth beauty, weeping fire, aunt relenting her, I hardly think I courage go next day. But always went me, I followed. I got, Sunday, three-and-twenty miles straight road, though easily, I new kind toil. I see myself, evening closes in, coming bridge Rochester, footsore tired, eating bread I bought supper. One two little houses, notice, ‘Lodgings Travellers’, hanging out, tempted me; I afraid spending pence I had, even afraid vicious looks trampers I met overtaken. I sought shelter, therefore, sky; toiling Chatham,--which, night’s aspect, mere dream chalk, drawbridges, mastless ships muddy river, roofed like Noah’s arks,--crept, last, upon sort grass-grown battery overhanging lane, sentry walking fro. Here I lay down, near cannon; and, happy society sentry’s footsteps, though he knew boys Salem House known lying wall, slept soundly morning. Very stiff sore foot I morning, quite dazed beating drums marching troops, seemed hem every side I went towards long narrow street. Feeling I could go little way day, I reserve strength getting journey’s end, I resolved make sale jacket principal business. Accordingly, I took jacket off, I might learn without it; carrying arm, began tour inspection various slop-shops. It likely place sell jacket in; dealers second-hand clothes numerous, were, generally speaking, look-out customers shop doors. But had, hanging among stock, officer’s coat two, epaulettes all, I rendered timid costly nature dealings, walked long time without offering merchandise anyone. This modesty mine directed attention marine-store shops, shops Mr. Dolloby’s, preference regular dealers. At last I found one I thought looked promising, corner dirty lane, ending enclosure full stinging-nettles, palings second-hand sailors’ clothes, seemed overflowed shop, fluttering among cots, rusty guns, oilskin hats, certain trays full many old rusty keys many sizes seemed various enough open doors world. Into shop, low small, darkened rather lighted little window, overhung clothes, descended steps, I went palpitating heart; relieved ugly old man, lower part his face covered stubbly grey beard, rushed dirty den behind it, seized hair head. He dreadful old man look at, filthy flannel waistcoat, smelling terribly rum. His bedstead, covered tumbled ragged piece patchwork, den he come from, another little window showed prospect stinging-nettles, lame donkey. ‘Oh, want?’ grinned old man, fierce, monotonous whine. ‘Oh, eyes limbs, want? Oh, lungs liver, want? Oh, goroo, goroo!’ I much dismayed words, particularly repetition last unknown one, kind rattle his throat, I could make answer; hereupon old man, still holding hair, repeated: ‘Oh, want? Oh, eyes limbs, want? Oh, lungs liver, want? Oh, goroo!’--which he screwed himself, energy made his eyes start his head. ‘I wanted know,’ I said, trembling, ‘if would buy jacket.’ ‘Oh, let us see jacket!’ cried old man. ‘Oh, heart fire, show jacket us! Oh, eyes limbs, bring jacket out!’ With he took his trembling hands, like claws great bird, hair; put pair spectacles, ornamental his inflamed eyes. ‘Oh, much jacket?’ cried old man, examining it. ‘Oh--goroo!--how much jacket?’ ‘Half-a-crown,’ I answered, recovering myself. ‘Oh, lungs liver,’ cried old man, ‘no! Oh, eyes, no! Oh, limbs, no! Eighteenpence. Goroo!’ Every time he uttered ejaculation, his eyes seemed danger starting out; every sentence he spoke, he delivered sort tune, always exactly same, like gust wind, begins low, mounts high, falls again, comparison I find it. ‘Well,’ said I, glad closed bargain, ‘I will take eighteenpence.’ ‘Oh, liver!’ cried old man, throwing jacket shelf. ‘Get shop! Oh, lungs, get shop! Oh, eyes limbs--goroo!--do not ask money; make exchange.’ I never frightened life, since; I told humbly I wanted money, nothing else use me, I would wait it, he desired, outside, wish hurry him. So I went outside, sat shade corner. And I sat many hours, shade became sunlight, sunlight became shade again, still I sat waiting money. There never another drunken madman line business, I hope. That he well known neighbourhood, enjoyed reputation sold devil, I soon understood visits he received boys, continually came skirmishing shop, shouting legend, calling bring his gold. ‘You are not poor, know, Charley, pretend. Bring gold. Bring gold sold devil for. Come! It is lining mattress, Charley. Rip open let us some!’ This, many offers lend knife purpose, exasperated degree, whole day succession rushes his part, flights part boys. Sometimes his rage he would take one them, come me, mouthing he going tear pieces; then, remembering me, time, would dive shop, lie upon his bed, I thought sound his voice, yelling frantic way, his windy tune, ‘Death Nelson’; Oh! every line, innumerable Goroos interspersed. As bad enough me, boys, connecting establishment, account patience perseverance I sat outside, half-dressed, pelted me, used ill day. He made many attempts induce consent exchange; one time coming fishing-rod, another fiddle, another cocked hat, another flute. But I resisted overtures, sat desperation; time asking him, tears eyes, money jacket. At last he began pay halfpence time; full two hours getting easy stages shilling. ‘Oh, eyes limbs!’ he cried, peeping hideously shop, long pause, ‘will go twopence more?’ ‘I cannot,’ I said; ‘I shall starved.’ ‘Oh, lungs liver, go threepence?’ ‘I would go nothing, I could,’ I said, ‘but I want money badly.’ ‘Oh, go-roo!’ (it really impossible express he twisted ejaculation himself, he peeped round door-post me, showing nothing his crafty old head); ‘will go fourpence?’ I faint weary I closed offer; taking money his claw, without trembling, went away hungry thirsty I ever been, little sunset. But expense threepence I soon refreshed completely; and, better spirits then, limped seven miles upon road. My bed night another haystack, I rested comfortably, washed blistered feet stream, dressed well I able, cool leaves. When I took road next morning, I found lay succession hop-grounds orchards. It sufficiently late year orchards ruddy ripe apples; places hop-pickers already work. I thought extremely beautiful, made mind sleep among hops night: imagining cheerful companionship long perspectives poles, graceful leaves twining round them. The trampers worse ever day, inspired dread yet quite fresh mind. Some ferocious-looking ruffians, stared I went by; stopped, perhaps, called come back speak them, I took heels, stoned me. I recollect one young fellow--a tinker, I suppose, his wallet brazier--who woman him, faced stared thus; roared tremendous voice come back, I halted looked round. ‘Come here, you are called,’ said tinker, ‘or I will rip young body open.’ I thought best go back. As I drew nearer them, trying propitiate tinker looks, I observed woman black eye. ‘Where going?’ said tinker, gripping bosom shirt his blackened hand. ‘I going Dover,’ I said. ‘Where come from?’ asked tinker, giving his hand another turn shirt, hold securely. ‘I come London,’ I said. ‘What lay upon?’ asked tinker. ‘Are prig?’ ‘N-no,’ I said. ‘Are not you, G--? If make brag honesty me,’ said tinker, ‘I will knock brains out.’ With his disengaged hand he made menace striking me, looked head foot. ‘Have got price pint beer you?’ said tinker. ‘If have, it, afore I take away!’ I certainly produced it, I met woman’s look, saw her slightly shake her head, form ‘No!’ her lips. ‘I poor,’ I said, attempting smile, ‘and got money.’ ‘Why, mean?’ said tinker, looking sternly me, I almost feared he saw money pocket. ‘Sir!’ I stammered. ‘What mean,’ said tinker, ‘by wearing brother’s silk handkerchief! Give here!’ And he mine neck moment, tossed woman. The woman burst fit laughter, she thought joke, tossed back me, nodded once, slightly before, made word ‘Go!’ her lips. Before I could obey, however, tinker seized handkerchief hand roughness threw away like feather, putting loosely round his neck, turned upon woman oath, knocked her down. I never shall forget seeing her fall backward hard road, lie her bonnet tumbled off, her hair whitened dust; nor, I looked back distance, seeing her sitting pathway, bank roadside, wiping blood her face corner her shawl, he went ahead. This adventure frightened so, that, afterwards, I saw people coming, I turned back I could find hiding-place, I remained gone sight; happened often, I seriously delayed. But difficulty, difficulties journey, I seemed sustained led fanciful picture mother her youth, I came world. It always kept company. It there, among hops, I lay sleep; waking morning; went day. I associated it, ever since, sunny street Canterbury, dozing hot light; sight old houses gateways, stately, grey Cathedral, rooks sailing round towers. When I came, last, upon bare, wide downs near Dover, relieved solitary aspect scene hope; I reached first great aim journey, actually set foot town itself, sixth day flight, desert me. But then, strange say, I stood ragged shoes, dusty, sunburnt, half-clothed figure, place long desired, seemed vanish like dream, leave helpless dispirited. I inquired aunt among boatmen first, received various answers. One said she lived South Foreland Light, singed her whiskers so; another, she made fast great buoy outside harbour, could visited half-tide; third, she locked Maidstone jail child-stealing; fourth, she seen mount broom last high wind, make direct Calais. The fly-drivers, among I inquired next, equally jocose equally disrespectful; shopkeepers, liking appearance, generally replied, without hearing I say, got nothing me. I felt miserable destitute I done period running away. My money gone, I nothing left dispose of; I hungry, thirsty, worn out; seemed distant end I remained London. The morning worn away inquiries, I sitting step empty shop street corner, near market-place, deliberating upon wandering towards places mentioned, fly-driver, coming his carriage, dropped horsecloth. Something good-natured man’s face, I handed up, encouraged ask he could tell Miss Trotwood lived; though I asked question often, almost died upon lips. ‘Trotwood,’ said he. ‘Let see. I know name, too. Old lady?’ ‘Yes,’ I said, ‘rather.’ ‘Pretty stiff back?’ said he, making upright. ‘Yes,’ I said. ‘I think likely.’ ‘Carries bag?’ said he--‘bag good deal room it--is gruffish, comes upon you, sharp?’ My heart sank within I acknowledged undoubted accuracy description. ‘Why then, I tell what,’ said he. ‘If go there,’ pointing his whip towards heights, ‘and keep right till come houses facing sea, I think you will hear her. My opinion she will not stand anything, here is penny you.’ I accepted gift thankfully, bought loaf it. Dispatching refreshment way, I went direction friend indicated, walked good distance without coming houses he mentioned. At length I saw me; approaching them, went little shop (it used call general shop, home), inquired could goodness tell Miss Trotwood lived. I addressed man behind counter, weighing rice young woman; latter, taking inquiry herself, turned round quickly. ‘My mistress?’ she said. ‘What want her, boy?’ ‘I want,’ I replied, ‘to speak her, please.’ ‘To beg her, mean,’ retorted damsel. ‘No,’ I said, ‘indeed.’ But suddenly remembering truth I came purpose, I held peace confusion, felt face burn. My aunt’s handmaid, I supposed she she said, put her rice little basket walked shop; telling I could follow her, I wanted know Miss Trotwood lived. I needed second permission; though I time state consternation agitation, legs shook me. I followed young woman, soon came neat little cottage cheerful bow-windows: front it, small square gravelled court garden full flowers, carefully tended, smelling deliciously. ‘This Miss Trotwood’s,’ said young woman. ‘Now know; that is I got say.’ With words she hurried house, shake responsibility appearance; left standing garden-gate, looking disconsolately top towards parlour window, muslin curtain partly undrawn middle, large round green screen fan fastened windowsill, small table, great chair, suggested aunt might moment seated awful state. My shoes time woeful condition. The soles she would bit bit, upper leathers broken burst shape form shoes departed them. My hat (which served night-cap, too) crushed bent, old battered handleless saucepan dunghill need ashamed vie it. My shirt trousers, stained heat, dew, grass, Kentish soil I slept--and torn besides--might frightened birds aunt’s garden, I stood gate. My hair known comb brush since I left London. My face, neck, hands, unaccustomed exposure air sun, burnt berry-brown. From head foot I powdered almost white chalk dust, I come lime-kiln. In plight, strong consciousness it, I waited introduce to, make first impression on, formidable aunt. The unbroken stillness parlour window leading infer, while, she there, I lifted eyes window it, I saw florid, pleasant-looking gentleman, grey head, shut one eye grotesque manner, nodded his head several times, shook often, laughed, went away. I discomposed enough before; I much discomposed unexpected behaviour, I point slinking off, think I best proceed, came house lady her handkerchief tied her cap, pair gardening gloves her hands, wearing gardening pocket like toll-man’s apron, carrying great knife. I knew her immediately Miss Betsey, she came stalking house exactly poor mother often described her stalking garden Blunderstone Rookery. ‘Go away!’ said Miss Betsey, shaking her head, making distant chop air her knife. ‘Go along! No boys here!’ I watched her, heart lips, she marched corner her garden, stooped dig little root there. Then, without scrap courage, great deal desperation, I went softly stood beside her, touching her finger. ‘If please, madam,’ I began. She started looked up. ‘If please, aunt.’ ‘EH?’ exclaimed Miss Betsey, tone amazement I never heard approached. ‘If please, aunt, I nephew.’ ‘Oh, Lord!’ said aunt. And sat flat garden-path. ‘I David Copperfield, Blunderstone, Suffolk--where came, night I born, saw dear mama. I unhappy since she died. I slighted, taught nothing, thrown upon myself, put work fit me. It made run away you. I robbed first setting out, walked way, never slept bed since I began journey.’ Here self-support gave way once; movement hands, intended show her ragged state, call witness I suffered something, I broke passion crying, I suppose pent within week. My aunt, every sort expression wonder discharged her countenance, sat gravel, staring me, I began cry; she got great hurry, collared me, took parlour. Her first proceeding unlock tall press, bring several bottles, pour contents mouth. I think must taken random, I sure I tasted aniseed water, anchovy sauce, salad dressing. When she administered restoratives, I still quite hysterical, unable control sobs, she put sofa, shawl head, handkerchief her head feet, lest I sully cover; then, sitting herself behind green fan screen I already mentioned, I could see her face, ejaculated intervals, ‘Mercy us!’ letting exclamations like minute guns. After time she rang bell. ‘Janet,’ said aunt, her servant came in. ‘Go upstairs, give compliments Mr. Dick, say I wish speak him.’ Janet looked little surprised see lying stiffly sofa (I afraid move lest displeasing aunt), went her errand. My aunt, her hands behind her, walked room, gentleman squinted upper window came laughing. ‘Mr. Dick,’ said aunt, ‘do not fool, nobody discreet can, choose. We know that. So do not fool, whatever are.’ The gentleman serious immediately, looked me, I thought, he would entreat say nothing window. ‘Mr. Dick,’ said aunt, ‘you heard mention David Copperfield? Now do not pretend memory, I know better.’ ‘David Copperfield?’ said Mr. Dick, appear remember much it. ‘David Copperfield? Oh yes, sure. David, certainly.’ ‘Well,’ said aunt, ‘this his boy--his son. He would like his father it is possible be, he like his mother, too.’ ‘His son?’ said Mr. Dick. ‘David’s son? Indeed!’ ‘Yes,’ pursued aunt, ‘and he done pretty piece business. He run away. Ah! His sister, Betsey Trotwood, never would run away.’ My aunt shook her head firmly, confident character behaviour girl never born. ‘Oh! think she would not run away?’ said Mr. Dick. ‘Bless save man,’ exclaimed aunt, sharply, ‘how he talks! Do not I know she would not? She would lived her god-mother, devoted one another. Where, name wonder, his sister, Betsey Trotwood, run from, to?’ ‘Nowhere,’ said Mr. Dick. ‘Well then,’ returned aunt, softened reply, ‘how pretend wool-gathering, Dick, sharp surgeon’s lancet? Now, see young David Copperfield, question I put is, shall I him?’ ‘What shall him?’ said Mr. Dick, feebly, scratching his head. ‘Oh! him?’ ‘Yes,’ said aunt, grave look, her forefinger held up. ‘Come! I want sound advice.’ ‘Why, I you,’ said Mr. Dick, considering, looking vacantly me, ‘I should--’ The contemplation seemed inspire sudden idea, he added, briskly, ‘I wash him!’ ‘Janet,’ said aunt, turning round quiet triumph, I understand, ‘Mr. Dick sets us right. Heat bath!’ Although I deeply interested dialogue, I could help observing aunt, Mr. Dick, Janet, progress, completing survey I already engaged making room. My aunt tall, hard-featured lady, means ill-looking. There inflexibility her face, her voice, her gait carriage, amply sufficient account effect she made upon gentle creature like mother; her features rather handsome otherwise, though unbending austere. I particularly noticed she quick, bright eye. Her hair, grey, arranged two plain divisions, I believe would called mob-cap; I mean cap, much common now, side-pieces fastening chin. Her dress lavender colour, perfectly neat; scantily made, she desired little encumbered possible. I remember I thought it, form, like riding-habit superfluous skirt cut off, anything else. She wore her side gentleman’s gold watch, I might judge size make, appropriate chain seals; she linen her throat unlike shirt-collar, things her wrists like little shirt-wristbands. Mr. Dick, I already said, grey-headed, florid: I said him, saying so, his head curiously bowed--not age; reminded one Mr. Creakle’s boys’ heads beating--and his grey eyes prominent large, strange kind watery brightness made me, combination his vacant manner, his submission aunt, his childish delight she praised him, suspect little mad; though, he mad, he came puzzled extremely. He dressed like ordinary gentleman, loose grey morning coat waistcoat, white trousers; his watch his fob, his money his pockets: he rattled he proud it. Janet pretty blooming girl, nineteen twenty, perfect picture neatness. Though I made observation her moment, I may mention I discover afterwards, namely, she one series protegees aunt taken her service expressly educate renouncement mankind, generally completed abjuration marrying baker. The room neat Janet aunt. As I laid pen, moment since, think it, air sea came blowing again, mixed perfume flowers; I saw old-fashioned furniture brightly rubbed polished, aunt’s inviolable chair table round green fan bow-window, drugget-covered carpet, cat, kettle-holder, two canaries, old china, punchbowl full dried rose-leaves, tall press guarding sorts bottles pots, and, wonderfully keeping rest, dusty self upon sofa, taking note everything. Janet gone away get bath ready, aunt, great alarm, became one moment rigid indignation, hardly voice cry out, ‘Janet! Donkeys!’ Upon which, Janet came running stairs house flames, darted little piece green front, warned two saddle-donkeys, lady-ridden, presumed set hoof upon it; aunt, rushing house, seized bridle third animal laden bestriding child, turned him, led forth sacred precincts, boxed ears unlucky urchin attendance dared profane hallowed ground. To hour I do not know whether aunt lawful right way patch green; she settled her mind she had, her. The one great outrage her life, demanding constantly avenged, passage donkey immaculate spot. In whatever occupation she engaged, however interesting her conversation she taking part, donkey turned current her ideas moment, she upon straight. Jugs water, watering-pots, kept secret places ready discharged offending boys; sticks laid ambush behind door; sallies made hours; incessant war prevailed. Perhaps agreeable excitement donkey-boys; perhaps sagacious donkeys, understanding case stood, delighted constitutional obstinacy coming way. I know three alarms bath ready; occasion last desperate all, I saw aunt engage, single-handed, sandy-headed lad fifteen, bump his sandy head her gate, he seemed comprehend matter. These interruptions ridiculous me, she giving broth table-spoon time (having firmly persuaded herself I actually starving, must receive nourishment first small quantities), and, mouth yet open receive spoon, she would put back basin, cry ‘Janet! Donkeys!’ go assault. The bath great comfort. For I began sensible acute pains limbs lying fields, tired low I could hardly keep awake five minutes together. When I bathed, (I mean aunt Janet) enrobed shirt pair trousers belonging Mr. Dick, tied two three great shawls. What sort bundle I looked like, I do not know, I felt hot one. Feeling also faint drowsy, I soon lay sofa fell asleep. It might dream, originating fancy occupied mind long, I awoke impression aunt come bent me, put hair away face, laid head comfortably, stood looking me. The words, ‘Pretty fellow,’ ‘Poor fellow,’ seemed ears, too; certainly nothing else, I awoke, lead believe uttered aunt, sat bow-window gazing sea behind green fan, mounted kind swivel, turned way. We dined soon I awoke, roast fowl pudding; I sitting table, unlike trussed bird myself, moving arms considerable difficulty. But aunt swathed up, I made complaint inconvenienced. All time I deeply anxious know she going me; she took her dinner profound silence, except she occasionally fixed her eyes sitting opposite, said, ‘Mercy upon us!’ means relieve anxiety. The cloth drawn, sherry put upon table (of I glass), aunt sent Mr. Dick again, joined us, looked wise he could she requested attend story, she elicited me, gradually, course questions. During recital, she kept her eyes Mr. Dick, I thought would gone sleep that, who, whensoever he lapsed smile, checked frown aunt. ‘Whatever possessed poor unfortunate Baby, she must go married again,’ said aunt, I finished, ‘I cannot conceive.’ ‘Perhaps she fell love her second husband,’ Mr. Dick suggested. ‘Fell love!’ repeated aunt. ‘What mean? What business she it?’ ‘Perhaps,’ Mr. Dick simpered, thinking little, ‘she pleasure.’ ‘Pleasure, indeed!’ replied aunt. ‘A mighty pleasure poor Baby fix her simple faith upon dog fellow, certain ill-use her way other. What she propose herself, I like know! She one husband. She seen David Copperfield world, always running wax dolls his cradle. She got baby--oh, pair babies she gave birth child sitting here, Friday night!--and she want?’ Mr. Dick secretly shook his head me, he thought getting this. ‘She could not even baby like anybody else,’ said aunt. ‘Where child’s sister, Betsey Trotwood? Not forthcoming. Do not tell me!’ Mr. Dick seemed quite frightened. ‘That little man doctor, his head one side,’ said aunt, ‘Jellips, whatever his name was, he about? All he could do, say me, like robin redbreast--as he is--“It is boy.” A boy! Yah, imbecility whole set ‘them!’ The heartiness ejaculation startled Mr. Dick exceedingly; me, too, I tell truth. ‘And then, enough, she stood sufficiently light child’s sister, Betsey Trotwood,’ said aunt, ‘she marries second time--goes marries Murderer--or man name like it--and stands THIS child’s light! And natural consequence is, anybody baby might foreseen, he prowls wanders. He is like Cain he grown up, he be.’ Mr. Dick looked hard me, identify character. ‘And there is woman Pagan name,’ said aunt, ‘that Peggotty, she goes gets married next. Because she seen enough evil attending things, she goes gets married next, child relates. I hope,’ said aunt, shaking her head, ‘that her husband one Poker husbands abound newspapers, beat her well one.’ I could bear hear old nurse decried, made subject wish. I told aunt indeed she mistaken. That Peggotty best, truest, faithful, devoted, self-denying friend servant world; ever loved dearly, ever loved mother dearly; held mother’s dying head upon her arm, whose face mother imprinted her last grateful kiss. And remembrance both, choking me, I broke I trying say her home home, she mine, I would gone her shelter, her humble station, made fear I might bring trouble her--I broke down, I say, I trying say so, laid face hands upon table. ‘Well, well!’ said aunt, ‘the child right stand stood him--Janet! Donkeys!’ I thoroughly believe unfortunate donkeys, come good understanding; aunt laid her hand shoulder, impulse upon me, thus emboldened, embrace her beseech her protection. But interruption, disorder she thrown struggle outside, put end softer ideas present, kept aunt indignantly declaiming Mr. Dick her determination appeal redress laws her country, bring actions trespass whole donkey proprietorship Dover, tea-time. After tea, sat window--on look-out, I imagined, aunt’s sharp expression face, invaders--until dusk, Janet set candles, backgammon-board, table, pulled blinds. ‘Now, Mr. Dick,’ said aunt, her grave look, her forefinger before, ‘I going ask another question. Look child.’ ‘David’s son?’ said Mr. Dick, attentive, puzzled face. ‘Exactly so,’ returned aunt. ‘What would him, now?’ ‘Do David’s son?’ said Mr. Dick. ‘Ay,’ replied aunt, ‘with David’s son.’ ‘Oh!’ said Mr. Dick. ‘Yes. Do with--I put bed.’ ‘Janet!’ cried aunt, complacent triumph I remarked before. ‘Mr. Dick sets us right. If bed ready, we will take it.’ Janet reporting quite ready, I taken it; kindly, sort like prisoner; aunt going front Janet bringing rear. The circumstance gave new hope, aunt’s stopping stairs inquire smell fire prevalent there; janet’s replying she making tinder kitchen, old shirt. But clothes room odd heap things I wore; I left there, little taper aunt forewarned would burn exactly five minutes, I heard lock door outside. Turning things mind I deemed possible aunt, could know nothing me, might suspect I habit running away, took precautions, account, safe keeping. The room pleasant one, top house, overlooking sea, moon shining brilliantly. After I said prayers, candle burnt out, I remember I still sat looking moonlight water, I could hope read fortune it, bright book; see mother her child, coming Heaven, along shining path, look upon she looked I last saw her sweet face. I remember solemn feeling length I turned eyes away, yielded sensation gratitude rest sight white-curtained bed--and much lying softly upon it, nestling snow-white sheets!--inspired. I remember I thought solitary places night sky I slept, I prayed I never might houseless more, never might forget houseless. I remember I seemed float, then, melancholy glory track upon sea, away world dreams. CHAPTER 14. MY AUNT MAKES UP HER MIND ABOUT ME On going morning, I found aunt musing profoundly breakfast table, her elbow tray, contents urn overflowed teapot laying whole table-cloth water, entrance put her meditations flight. I felt sure I subject her reflections, ever anxious know her intentions towards me. Yet I dared express anxiety, lest give her offence. My eyes, however, much control tongue, attracted towards aunt often breakfast. I never could look her moments together I found her looking me--in odd thoughtful manner, I immense way off, instead side small round table. When she finished her breakfast, aunt deliberately leaned back her chair, knitted her brows, folded her arms, contemplated her leisure, fixedness attention I quite overpowered embarrassment. Not yet finished breakfast, I attempted hide confusion proceeding it; knife tumbled fork, fork tripped knife, I chipped bits bacon surprising height air instead cutting eating, choked tea, persisted going wrong way instead right one, I gave altogether, sat blushing aunt’s close scrutiny. ‘Hallo!’ said aunt, long time. I looked up, met her sharp bright glance respectfully. ‘I written him,’ said aunt. ‘To--?’ ‘To father-in-law,’ said aunt. ‘I sent letter I will trouble attend to, he I fall out, I tell him!’ ‘Does he know I am, aunt?’ I inquired, alarmed. ‘I told him,’ said aunt, nod. ‘Shall I--be--given him?’ I faltered. ‘I do not know,’ said aunt. ‘We shall see.’ ‘Oh! I cannot think I shall do,’ I exclaimed, ‘if I go back Mr. Murdstone!’ ‘I do not know anything it,’ said aunt, shaking her head. ‘I cannot say, I sure. We shall see.’ My spirits sank words, I became downcast heavy heart. My aunt, without appearing take much heed me, put coarse apron bib, she took press; washed teacups her hands; and, everything washed set tray again, cloth folded put top whole, rang Janet remove it. She next swept crumbs little broom (putting pair gloves first), appear one microscopic speck left carpet; next dusted arranged room, dusted arranged hair’s breadth already. When tasks performed her satisfaction, she took gloves apron, folded up, put particular corner press taken, brought her work-box her table open window, sat down, green fan her light, work. ‘I wish you would go upstairs,’ said aunt, she threaded her needle, ‘and give compliments Mr. Dick, I will glad know he gets his Memorial.’ I rose alacrity, acquit commission. ‘I suppose,’ said aunt, eyeing narrowly she eyed needle threading it, ‘you think Mr. Dick short name, eh?’ ‘I thought rather short name, yesterday,’ I confessed. ‘You suppose he has not got longer name, he chose use it,’ said aunt, loftier air. ‘Babley--Mr. Richard Babley--that is gentleman’s true name.’ I going suggest, modest sense youth familiarity I already guilty of, I better give full benefit name, aunt went say: ‘But do not call it, whatever do. He cannot bear his name. That is peculiarity his. Though I do not know it is much peculiarity, either; he ill-used enough, bear it, mortal antipathy it, Heaven knows. Mr. Dick his name here, everywhere else, now--if he ever went anywhere else, he do not. So take care, child, do not call anything BUT Mr. Dick.’ I promised obey, went upstairs message; thinking, I went, Mr. Dick working his Memorial long, rate I seen working it, open door, I came down, he probably getting well indeed. I found still driving long pen, his head almost laid upon paper. He intent upon it, I ample leisure observe large paper kite corner, confusion bundles manuscript, number pens, and, all, quantity ink (which he seemed in, half-gallon jars dozen), he observed present. ‘Ha! Phoebus!’ said Mr. Dick, laying his pen. ‘How world go? I will tell what,’ he added, lower tone, ‘I should not wish mentioned, it is a--’ he beckoned me, put his lips close ear--‘it is mad world. Mad Bedlam, boy!’ said Mr. Dick, taking snuff round box table, laughing heartily. Without presuming give opinion question, I delivered message. ‘Well,’ said Mr. Dick, answer, ‘my compliments her, I--I believe I made start. I think I made start,’ said Mr. Dick, passing his hand among his grey hair, casting anything confident look his manuscript. ‘You school?’ ‘Yes, sir,’ I answered; ‘for short time.’ ‘Do recollect date,’ said Mr. Dick, looking earnestly me, taking his pen note down, ‘when King Charles First his head cut off?’ I said I believed happened year sixteen hundred forty-nine. ‘Well,’ returned Mr. Dick, scratching his ear his pen, looking dubiously me. ‘So books say; I do not see be. Because, long ago, could people made mistake putting trouble his head, taken off, mine?’ I much surprised inquiry; could give information point. ‘It is strange,’ said Mr. Dick, despondent look upon his papers, his hand among his hair again, ‘that I never get quite right. I never make perfectly clear. But matter, matter!’ he said cheerfully, rousing himself, ‘there is time enough! My compliments Miss Trotwood, I getting well indeed.’ I going away, he directed attention kite. ‘What think kite?’ he said. I answered beautiful one. I think must much seven feet high. ‘I made it. We will go fly it, I,’ said Mr. Dick. ‘Do see this?’ He showed covered manuscript, closely laboriously written; plainly, I looked along lines, I thought I saw allusion King Charles First’s head again, one two places. ‘There is plenty string,’ said Mr. Dick, ‘and flies high, takes facts long way. That is manner diffusing ‘them. I do not know may come down. It is according circumstances, wind, forth; I take chance that.’ His face mild pleasant, something reverend it, though hale hearty, I sure he good-humoured jest me. So I laughed, he laughed, parted best friends possible. ‘Well, child,’ said aunt, I went downstairs. ‘And Mr. Dick, morning?’ I informed her he sent his compliments, getting well indeed. ‘What think him?’ said aunt. I shadowy idea endeavouring evade question, replying I thought nice gentleman; aunt put off, she laid her work her lap, said, folding her hands upon it: ‘Come! Your sister Betsey Trotwood would told she thought anyone, directly. Be like sister can, speak out!’ ‘Is he--is Mr. Dick--I ask I do not know, aunt--is he his mind, then?’ I stammered; I felt I dangerous ground. ‘Not morsel,’ said aunt. ‘Oh, indeed!’ I observed faintly. ‘If anything world,’ said aunt, great decision force manner, ‘that Mr. Dick not, it is that.’ I nothing better offer, another timid, ‘Oh, indeed!’ ‘He CALLED mad,’ said aunt. ‘I selfish pleasure saying he called mad, I benefit his society advice last ten years upwards--in fact, ever since sister, Betsey Trotwood, disappointed me.’ ‘So long that?’ I said. ‘And nice people were, audacity call mad,’ pursued aunt. ‘Mr. Dick sort distant connexion mine--it does not matter how; I need not enter that. If had not me, his brother would shut life. That is all.’ I afraid hypocritical me, seeing aunt felt strongly subject, I tried look I felt strongly too. ‘A proud fool!’ said aunt. ‘Because his brother little eccentric--though he half eccentric good many people--he did not like visible his house, sent away private asylum-place: though he left his particular care deceased father, thought almost natural. And wise man he must think so! Mad himself, doubt.’ Again, aunt looked quite convinced, I endeavoured look quite convinced also. ‘So I stepped in,’ said aunt, ‘and made offer. I said, “Your brother’s sane--a great deal sane are, ever be, hoped. Let his little income, come live me. I afraid him, I proud, I ready take care him, shall ill-treat people (besides asylum-folks) done.” After good deal squabbling,’ said aunt, ‘I got him; he ever since. He friendly amenable creature existence; advice!--But nobody knows man’s mind is, except myself.’ My aunt smoothed her dress shook her head, she smoothed defiance whole world one, shook other. ‘He favourite sister,’ said aunt, ‘a good creature, kind him. But she do--took husband. And HE do--made her wretched. It effect upon mind Mr. Dick (that is madness, I hope!) that, combined his fear his brother, his sense his unkindness, threw fever. That he came me, recollection oppressive even now. Did he say anything King Charles First, child?’ ‘Yes, aunt.’ ‘Ah!’ said aunt, rubbing her nose she little vexed. ‘That is his allegorical way expressing it. He connects his illness great disturbance agitation, naturally, that is figure, simile, whatever it is called, he chooses use. And should not he, he thinks proper!’ I said: ‘Certainly, aunt.’ ‘It is business-like way speaking,’ said aunt, ‘nor worldly way. I aware that; that is reason I insist upon it, shall not word his Memorial.’ ‘Is Memorial his history he writing, aunt?’ ‘Yes, child,’ said aunt, rubbing her nose again. ‘He memorializing Lord Chancellor, Lord Somebody other--one people, events, paid memorialized--about his affairs. I suppose go in, one days. He has not able draw yet, without introducing mode expressing himself; do not signify; keeps employed.’ In fact, I found afterwards Mr. Dick upwards ten years endeavouring keep King Charles First Memorial; he constantly getting it, now. ‘I say again,’ said aunt, ‘nobody knows man’s mind except myself; he is amenable friendly creature existence. If he likes fly kite sometimes, that! Franklin used fly kite. He Quaker, something sort, I mistaken. And Quaker flying kite much ridiculous object anybody else.’ If I could supposed aunt recounted particulars especial behoof, piece confidence me, I felt much distinguished, augured favourably mark her good opinion. But I could hardly help observing she launched them, chiefly question raised her mind, little reference me, though she addressed herself absence anybody else. At time, I must say generosity her championship poor harmless Mr. Dick, inspired young breast selfish hope myself, warmed unselfishly towards her. I believe I began know something aunt, notwithstanding her many eccentricities odd humours, honoured trusted in. Though she sharp day day before, donkeys often, thrown tremendous state indignation, young man, going by, ogled Janet window (which one gravest misdemeanours could committed aunt’s dignity), she seemed command respect, less fear. The anxiety I underwent, interval necessarily elapsed reply could received her letter Mr. Murdstone, extreme; I made endeavour suppress it, agreeable I could quiet way, aunt Mr. Dick. The latter I would gone fly great kite; I still clothes anything ornamental garments I decorated first day, confined house, except hour dark, aunt, health’s sake, paraded cliff outside, going bed. At length reply Mr. Murdstone came, aunt informed me, infinite terror, he coming speak her herself next day. On next day, still bundled curious habiliments, I sat counting time, flushed heated conflict sinking hopes rising fears within me; waiting startled sight gloomy face, whose non-arrival startled every minute. My aunt little imperious stern usual, I observed token her preparing herself receive visitor much dreaded me. She sat work window, I sat by, thoughts running astray possible impossible results Mr. Murdstone’s visit, pretty late afternoon. Our dinner indefinitely postponed; growing late, aunt ordered got ready, she gave sudden alarm donkeys, consternation amazement, I beheld Miss Murdstone, side-saddle, ride deliberately sacred piece green, stop front house, looking her. ‘Go along you!’ cried aunt, shaking her head her fist window. ‘You business there. How dare trespass? Go along! Oh! bold-faced thing!’ My aunt exasperated coolness Miss Murdstone looked her, I really believe she motionless, unable moment dart according custom. I seized opportunity inform her was; gentleman coming near offender (for way steep, he dropped behind), Mr. Murdstone himself. ‘I do not care is!’ cried aunt, still shaking her head gesticulating anything welcome bow-window. ‘I will not trespassed upon. I will not allow it. Go away! Janet, turn round. Lead off!’ I saw, behind aunt, sort hurried battle-piece, donkey stood resisting everybody, his four legs planted different ways, Janet tried pull round bridle, Mr. Murdstone tried lead on, Miss Murdstone struck Janet parasol, several boys, come see engagement, shouted vigorously. But aunt, suddenly descrying among young malefactor donkey’s guardian, one inveterate offenders her, though hardly his teens, rushed scene action, pounced upon him, captured him, dragged him, his jacket his head, his heels grinding ground, garden, and, calling upon Janet fetch constables justices, he might taken, tried, executed spot, held bay there. This part business, however, last long; young rascal, expert variety feints dodges, aunt conception, soon went whooping away, leaving deep impressions his nailed boots flower-beds, taking his donkey triumph him. Miss Murdstone, latter portion contest, dismounted, waiting her brother bottom steps, aunt leisure receive them. My aunt, little ruffled combat, marched past house, great dignity, took notice presence, announced Janet. ‘Shall I go away, aunt?’ I asked, trembling. ‘No, sir,’ said aunt. ‘Certainly not!’ With she pushed corner near her, fenced Me chair, prison bar justice. This position I continued occupy whole interview, I saw Mr. Miss Murdstone enter room. ‘Oh!’ said aunt, ‘I aware first I pleasure objecting. But I do not allow anybody ride turf. I make exceptions. I do not allow anybody it.’ ‘Your regulation rather awkward strangers,’ said Miss Murdstone. ‘Is it!’ said aunt. Mr. Murdstone seemed afraid renewal hostilities, interposing began: ‘Miss Trotwood!’ ‘I beg pardon,’ observed aunt keen look. ‘You Mr. Murdstone married widow late nephew, David Copperfield, Blunderstone Rookery!--Though Rookery, I do not know!’ ‘I am,’ said Mr. Murdstone. ‘You will excuse saying, sir,’ returned aunt, ‘that I think would much better happier thing left poor child alone.’ ‘I far agree Miss Trotwood remarked,’ observed Miss Murdstone, bridling, ‘that I consider lamented Clara been, essential respects, mere child.’ ‘It comfort me, madam,’ said aunt, ‘who getting life, likely made unhappy personal attractions, nobody say us.’ ‘No doubt!’ returned Miss Murdstone, though, I thought, ready gracious assent. ‘And certainly might been, say, better happier thing brother he never entered marriage. I always opinion.’ ‘I doubt have,’ said aunt. ‘Janet,’ ringing bell, ‘my compliments Mr. Dick, beg come down.’ Until he came, aunt sat perfectly upright stiff, frowning wall. When he came, aunt performed ceremony introduction. ‘Mr. Dick. An old intimate friend. On whose judgement,’ said aunt, emphasis, admonition Mr. Dick, biting his forefinger looking rather foolish, ‘I rely.’ Mr. Dick took his finger his mouth, hint, stood among group, grave attentive expression face. My aunt inclined her head Mr. Murdstone, went on: ‘Miss Trotwood: receipt letter, I considered act greater justice myself, perhaps respect you--’ ‘Thank you,’ said aunt, still eyeing keenly. ‘You need not mind me.’ ‘To answer person, however inconvenient journey,’ pursued Mr. Murdstone, ‘rather letter. This unhappy boy run away his friends his occupation--’ ‘And whose appearance,’ interposed his sister, directing general attention indefinable costume, ‘is perfectly scandalous disgraceful.’ ‘Jane Murdstone,’ said her brother, ‘have goodness interrupt me. This unhappy boy, Miss Trotwood, occasion much domestic trouble uneasiness; lifetime late dear wife, since. He sullen, rebellious spirit; violent temper; untoward, intractable disposition. Both sister endeavoured correct his vices, ineffectually. And I felt--we felt, I may say; sister fully confidence--that right receive grave dispassionate assurance lips.’ ‘It hardly necessary confirm anything stated brother,’ said Miss Murdstone; ‘but I beg observe, that, boys world, I believe worst boy.’ ‘Strong!’ said aunt, shortly. ‘But strong facts,’ returned Miss Murdstone. ‘Ha!’ said aunt. ‘Well, sir?’ ‘I opinions,’ resumed Mr. Murdstone, whose face darkened more, he aunt observed other, narrowly, ‘as best mode bringing up; founded, part, knowledge him, part knowledge means resources. I responsible myself, I act upon them, I say them. It enough I place boy eye friend own, respectable business; please him; he runs away it; makes common vagabond country; comes here, rags, appeal you, Miss Trotwood. I wish set you, honourably, exact consequences--so far within knowledge--of abetting appeal.’ ‘But respectable business first,’ said aunt. ‘If he boy, would put it, same, I suppose?’ ‘If he brother’s boy,’ returned Miss Murdstone, striking in, ‘his character, I trust, would altogether different.’ ‘Or poor child, his mother, alive, he would still gone respectable business, would he?’ said aunt. ‘I believe,’ said Mr. Murdstone, inclination his head, ‘that Clara would disputed nothing sister Jane Murdstone agreed best.’ Miss Murdstone confirmed audible murmur. ‘Humph!’ said aunt. ‘Unfortunate baby!’ Mr. Dick, rattling his money time, rattling loudly now, aunt felt necessary check look, saying: ‘The poor child’s annuity died her?’ ‘Died her,’ replied Mr. Murdstone. ‘And settlement little property--the house garden--the what is-its-name Rookery without rooks it--upon her boy?’ ‘It left her, unconditionally, her first husband,’ Mr. Murdstone began, aunt caught greatest irascibility impatience. ‘Good Lord, man, there is occasion say that. Left her unconditionally! I think I see David Copperfield looking forward condition sort kind, though stared point-blank face! Of course left her unconditionally. But she married again--when she took disastrous step marrying you, short,’ said aunt, ‘to plain--did one put word boy time?’ ‘My late wife loved her second husband, madam,’ said Mr. Murdstone, ‘and trusted implicitly him.’ ‘Your late wife, sir, unworldly, unhappy, unfortunate baby,’ returned aunt, shaking her head him. ‘That is she was. And now, got say next?’ ‘Merely this, Miss Trotwood,’ he returned. ‘I take David back--to take back unconditionally, dispose I think proper, deal I think right. I make promise, give pledge anybody. You may possibly idea, Miss Trotwood, abetting his running away, his complaints you. Your manner, I must say seem intended propitiate, induces think possible. Now I must caution abet once, abet good all; step me, now, must step in, Miss Trotwood, ever. I cannot trifle, trifled with. I here, first last time, take away. Is he ready go? If he not--and tell he not; pretence; indifferent what--my doors shut henceforth, yours, I take granted, open him.’ To address, aunt listened closest attention, sitting perfectly upright, her hands folded one knee, looking grimly speaker. When he finished, she turned her eyes command Miss Murdstone, without otherwise disturbing her attitude, said: ‘Well, madam, YOU got anything remark?’ ‘Indeed, Miss Trotwood,’ said Miss Murdstone, ‘all I could say well said brother, I know fact plainly stated him, I nothing add except thanks politeness. For great politeness, I sure,’ said Miss Murdstone; irony affected aunt, discomposed cannon I slept Chatham. ‘And boy say?’ said aunt. ‘Are ready go, David?’ I answered no, entreated her let go. I said neither Mr. Miss Murdstone ever liked me, ever kind me. That made mama, always loved dearly, unhappy me, I knew well, Peggotty knew it. I said I miserable I thought anybody could believe, knew young I was. And I begged prayed aunt--I forget terms now, I remember affected much then--to befriend protect me, father’s sake. ‘Mr. Dick,’ said aunt, ‘what shall I child?’ Mr. Dick considered, hesitated, brightened, rejoined, ‘Have measured suit clothes directly.’ ‘Mr. Dick,’ said aunt triumphantly, ‘give hand, common sense invaluable.’ Having shaken great cordiality, she pulled towards her said Mr. Murdstone: ‘You go like; I will take chance boy. If he is say he is, least I much then, done. But I do not believe word it.’ ‘Miss Trotwood,’ rejoined Mr. Murdstone, shrugging his shoulders, he rose, ‘if gentleman--’ ‘Bah! Stuff nonsense!’ said aunt. ‘Do not talk me!’ ‘How exquisitely polite!’ exclaimed Miss Murdstone, rising. ‘Overpowering, really!’ ‘Do think I do not know,’ said aunt, turning deaf ear sister, continuing address brother, shake her head infinite expression, ‘what kind life must led poor, unhappy, misdirected baby? Do think I do not know woeful day soft little creature first came her way--smirking making great eyes her, I will bound, could not say boh! goose!’ ‘I never heard anything elegant!’ said Miss Murdstone. ‘Do think I cannot understand well I seen you,’ pursued aunt, ‘now I DO see hear you--which, I tell candidly, anything pleasure me? Oh yes, bless us! smooth silky Mr. Murdstone first! The poor, benighted innocent never seen man. He made sweetness. He worshipped her. He doted her boy--tenderly doted him! He another father him, live together garden roses, were not they? Ugh! Get along you, do!’ said aunt. ‘I never heard anything like person life!’ exclaimed Miss Murdstone. ‘And made sure poor little fool,’ said aunt--‘God forgive I call her so, she gone YOU will not go hurry--because done wrong enough her hers, must begin train her, must you? begin break her, like poor caged bird, wear her deluded life away, teaching her sing YOUR notes?’ ‘This either insanity intoxication,’ said Miss Murdstone, perfect agony able turn current aunt’s address towards herself; ‘and suspicion it is intoxication.’ Miss Betsey, without taking least notice interruption, continued address herself Mr. Murdstone thing. ‘Mr. Murdstone,’ she said, shaking her finger him, ‘you tyrant simple baby, broke her heart. She loving baby--I know that; I knew it, years ever saw her--and best part her weakness gave her wounds she died of. There truth comfort, however like it. And instruments may make it.’ ‘Allow inquire, Miss Trotwood,’ interposed Miss Murdstone, ‘whom pleased call, choice words I experienced, brother’s instruments?’ ‘It clear enough, I told you, years YOU ever saw her--and why, mysterious dispensations Providence, ever see her, humanity comprehend--it clear enough poor soft little thing would marry somebody, time other; I hope would not bad turned out. That time, Mr. Murdstone, she gave birth her boy here,’ said aunt; ‘to poor child sometimes tormented her afterwards, disagreeable remembrance makes sight odious now. Aye, aye! need not wince!’ said aunt. ‘I know it is true without that.’ He stood door, while, observant her smile upon his face, though his black eyebrows heavily contracted. I remarked now, that, though smile his face still, his colour gone moment, he seemed breathe he running. ‘Good day, sir,’ said aunt, ‘and good-bye! Good day you, too, madam,’ said aunt, turning suddenly upon his sister. ‘Let see ride donkey green again, sure head upon shoulders, I will knock bonnet off, tread upon it!’ It would require painter, common painter too, depict aunt’s face she delivered herself unexpected sentiment, Miss Murdstone’s face she heard it. But manner speech, less matter, fiery, Miss Murdstone, without word answer, discreetly put her arm her brother’s, walked haughtily cottage; aunt remaining window looking them; prepared, I doubt, case donkey’s reappearance, carry her threat instant execution. No attempt defiance made, however, her face gradually relaxed, became pleasant, I emboldened kiss thank her; I great heartiness, arms clasped round her neck. I shook hands Mr. Dick, shook hands great many times, hailed happy close proceedings repeated bursts laughter. ‘You will consider guardian, jointly me, child, Mr. Dick,’ said aunt. ‘I shall delighted,’ said Mr. Dick, ‘to guardian David’s son.’ ‘Very good,’ returned aunt, ‘that is settled. I thinking, know, Mr. Dick, I might call Trotwood?’ ‘Certainly, certainly. Call Trotwood, certainly,’ said Mr. Dick. ‘David’s son’s Trotwood.’ ‘Trotwood Copperfield, mean,’ returned aunt. ‘Yes, sure. Yes. Trotwood Copperfield,’ said Mr. Dick, little abashed. My aunt took kindly notion, ready-made clothes, purchased afternoon, marked ‘Trotwood Copperfield’, her handwriting, indelible marking-ink, I put on; settled clothes ordered made (a complete outfit bespoke afternoon) marked way. Thus I began new life, new name, everything new me. Now state doubt over, I felt, many days, like one dream. I never thought I curious couple guardians, aunt Mr. Dick. I never thought anything myself, distinctly. The two things clearest mind were, remoteness come upon old Blunderstone life--which seemed lie haze immeasurable distance; curtain ever fallen life Murdstone Grinby’s. No one ever raised curtain since. I lifted moment, even narrative, reluctant hand, dropped gladly. The remembrance life fraught much pain me, much mental suffering want hope, I never courage even examine long I doomed lead it. Whether lasted year, more, less, I know. I know was, ceased be; I written, I leave it. CHAPTER 15. I MAKE ANOTHER BEGINNING Mr. Dick I soon became best friends, often, his day’s work done, went together fly great kite. Every day his life he long sitting Memorial, never made least progress, however hard he laboured, King Charles First always strayed it, sooner later, thrown aside, another one begun. The patience hope he bore perpetual disappointments, mild perception he something wrong King Charles First, feeble efforts he made keep out, certainty he came in, tumbled Memorial shape, made deep impression me. What Mr. Dick supposed would come Memorial, completed; he thought go, he thought do; he knew anybody else, I believe. Nor necessary he trouble questions, anything certain sun, certain Memorial never would finished. It quite affecting sight, I used think, see kite great height air. What he told me, his room, his belief disseminating statements pasted it, nothing old leaves abortive Memorials, might fancy sometimes; he out, looking kite sky, feeling pull tug his hand. He never looked serene he then. I used fancy, I sat evening, green slope, saw watch kite high quiet air, lifted his mind confusion, bore (such boyish thought) skies. As he wound string came lower lower beautiful light, fluttered ground, lay like dead thing, he seemed wake gradually dream; I remember seen take up, look lost way, come together, I pitied heart. While I advanced friendship intimacy Mr. Dick, I go backward favour his staunch friend, aunt. She took kindly me, that, course weeks, she shortened adopted name Trotwood Trot; even encouraged hope, I went I begun, I might take equal rank her affections sister Betsey Trotwood. ‘Trot,’ said aunt one evening, backgammon-board placed usual herself Mr. Dick, ‘we must forget education.’ This subject anxiety, I felt quite delighted her referring it. ‘Should like go school Canterbury?’ said aunt. I replied I like much, near her. ‘Good,’ said aunt. ‘Should like go tomorrow?’ Being already stranger general rapidity aunt’s evolutions, I surprised suddenness proposal, said: ‘Yes.’ ‘Good,’ said aunt again. ‘Janet, hire grey pony chaise tomorrow morning ten of the clock, pack Master Trotwood’s clothes tonight.’ I greatly elated orders; heart smote selfishness, I witnessed effect Mr. Dick, low-spirited prospect separation, played ill consequence, aunt, giving several admonitory raps knuckles her dice-box, shut board, declined play more. But, hearing aunt I sometimes come Saturday, he could sometimes come see Wednesday, he revived; vowed make another kite occasions, proportions greatly surpassing present one. In morning he downhearted again, would sustained giving money he his possession, gold silver too, aunt interposed, limited gift five shillings, which, his earnest petition, afterwards increased ten. We parted garden-gate affectionate manner, Mr. Dick go house aunt driven sight it. My aunt, perfectly indifferent public opinion, drove grey pony Dover masterly manner; sitting high stiff like state coachman, keeping steady eye upon wherever he went, making point letting his way respect. When came country road, she permitted relax little, however; looking valley cushion her side, asked whether I happy? ‘Very happy indeed, thank you, aunt,’ I said. She much gratified; her hands occupied, patted head her whip. ‘Is large school, aunt?’ I asked. ‘Why, I do not know,’ said aunt. ‘We going Mr. Wickfield’s first.’ ‘Does he keep school?’ I asked. ‘No, Trot,’ said aunt. ‘He keeps office.’ I asked information Mr. Wickfield, she offered none, conversed subjects came Canterbury, where, market-day, aunt great opportunity insinuating grey pony among carts, baskets, vegetables, huckster’s goods. The hair-breadth turns twists made, drew upon us variety speeches people standing about, always complimentary; aunt drove perfect indifference, I dare say would taken her way much coolness enemy’s country. At length stopped old house bulging road; house long low lattice-windows bulging still farther, beams carved heads ends bulging too, I fancied whole house leaning forward, trying see passing narrow pavement below. It quite spotless cleanliness. The old-fashioned brass knocker low arched door, ornamented carved garlands fruit flowers, twinkled like star; two stone steps descending door white covered fair linen; angles corners, carvings mouldings, quaint little panes glass, quainter little windows, though old hills, pure snow ever fell upon hills. When pony-chaise stopped door, eyes intent upon house, I saw cadaverous face appear small window ground floor (in little round tower formed one side house), quickly disappear. The low arched door opened, face came out. It quite cadaverous looked window, though grain tinge red sometimes observed skins red-haired people. It belonged red-haired person--a youth fifteen, I take now, looking much older--whose hair cropped close closest stubble; hardly eyebrows, eyelashes, eyes red-brown, unsheltered unshaded, I remember wondering he went sleep. He high-shouldered bony; dressed decent black, white wisp neckcloth; buttoned throat; long, lank, skeleton hand, particularly attracted attention, he stood pony’s head, rubbing his chin it, looking us chaise. ‘Is Mr. Wickfield home, Uriah Heep?’ said aunt. ‘Mr. Wickfield’s home, madam,’ said Uriah Heep, ‘if you will please walk there’--pointing his long hand room he meant. We got out; leaving hold pony, went long low parlour looking towards street, window I caught glimpse, I went in, Uriah Heep breathing pony’s nostrils, immediately covering his hand, he putting spell upon him. Opposite tall old chimney-piece two portraits: one gentleman grey hair (though means old man) black eyebrows, looking papers tied together red tape; other, lady, placid sweet expression face, looking me. I believe I turning search Uriah’s picture, when, door farther end room opening, gentleman entered, sight I turned first-mentioned portrait again, make quite sure come frame. But stationary; gentleman advanced light, I saw he years older he his picture painted. ‘Miss Betsey Trotwood,’ said gentleman, ‘pray walk in. I engaged moment, you will excuse busy. You know motive. I one life.’ Miss Betsey thanked him, went his room, furnished office, books, papers, tin boxes, forth. It looked garden, iron safe let wall; immediately mantelshelf, I wondered, I sat down, sweeps got round swept chimney. ‘Well, Miss Trotwood,’ said Mr. Wickfield; I soon found he, he lawyer, steward estates rich gentleman county; ‘what wind blows here? Not ill wind, I hope?’ ‘No,’ replied aunt. ‘I come law.’ ‘That is right, madam,’ said Mr. Wickfield. ‘You better come anything else.’ His hair quite white now, though his eyebrows still black. He agreeable face, and, I thought, handsome. There certain richness his complexion, I long accustomed, Peggotty’s tuition, connect port wine; I fancied his voice too, referred his growing corpulency because. He cleanly dressed, blue coat, striped waistcoat, nankeen trousers; his fine frilled shirt cambric neckcloth looked unusually soft white, reminding strolling fancy (I call mind) plumage breast swan. ‘This nephew,’ said aunt. ‘Was not aware one, Miss Trotwood,’ said Mr. Wickfield. ‘My grand-nephew, say,’ observed aunt. ‘Was not aware grand-nephew, I give word,’ said Mr. Wickfield. ‘I adopted him,’ said aunt, wave her hand, importing his knowledge his ignorance one her, ‘and I brought here, put school he may thoroughly well taught, well treated. Now tell school is, is, it.’ ‘Before I advise properly,’ said Mr. Wickfield--‘the old question, know. What is motive this?’ ‘Deuce take man!’ exclaimed aunt. ‘Always fishing motives, they are surface! Why, make child happy useful.’ ‘It must mixed motive, I think,’ said Mr. Wickfield, shaking his head smiling incredulously. ‘A mixed fiddlestick,’ returned aunt. ‘You claim one plain motive yourself. You do not suppose, I hope, plain dealer world?’ ‘Ay, I one motive life, Miss Trotwood,’ he rejoined, smiling. ‘Other people dozens, scores, hundreds. I one. There is difference. However, that is beside question. The best school? Whatever motive, want best?’ My aunt nodded assent. ‘At best have,’ said Mr. Wickfield, considering, ‘your nephew could not board now.’ ‘But he could board somewhere else, I suppose?’ suggested aunt. Mr. Wickfield thought I could. After little discussion, he proposed take aunt school, she might see judge herself; also, take her, object, two three houses he thought I could boarded. My aunt embracing proposal, three going together, he stopped said: ‘Our little friend might motive, perhaps, objecting arrangements. I think better leave behind?’ My aunt seemed disposed contest point; facilitate matters I said I would gladly remain behind, pleased; returned Mr. Wickfield’s office, I sat again, chair I first occupied, await return. It happened chair opposite narrow passage, ended little circular room I seen Uriah Heep’s pale face looking window. Uriah, taken pony neighbouring stable, work desk room, brass frame top hang paper upon, writing he making copy hanging. Though his face towards me, I thought, time, writing us, he could see me; looking way attentively, made uncomfortable observe that, every then, his sleepless eyes would come writing, like two red suns, stealthily stare I dare say whole minute time, his pen went, pretended go, cleverly ever. I made several attempts get way--such standing chair look map side room, poring columns Kentish newspaper--but always attracted back again; whenever I looked towards two red suns, I sure find them, either rising setting. At length, much relief, aunt Mr. Wickfield came back, pretty long absence. They successful I could wished; though advantages school undeniable, aunt approved boarding-houses proposed me. ‘It is unfortunate,’ said aunt. ‘I do not know do, Trot.’ ‘It happen unfortunately,’ said Mr. Wickfield. ‘But I will tell do, Miss Trotwood.’ ‘What is that?’ inquired aunt. ‘Leave nephew here, present. He is quiet fellow. He will not disturb all. It is capital house study. As quiet monastery, almost roomy. Leave here.’ My aunt evidently liked offer, though she delicate accepting it. So I. ‘Come, Miss Trotwood,’ said Mr. Wickfield. ‘This way difficulty. It is temporary arrangement, know. If do not act well, do not quite accord mutual convenience, he easily go right-about. There time find better place meanwhile. You better determine leave present!’ ‘I much obliged you,’ said aunt; ‘and he, I see; but--’ ‘Come! I know mean,’ cried Mr. Wickfield. ‘You shall oppressed receipt favours, Miss Trotwood. You may pay him, like. We will not hard terms, shall pay will.’ ‘On understanding,’ said aunt, ‘though does not lessen real obligation, I shall glad leave him.’ ‘Then come see little housekeeper,’ said Mr. Wickfield. We accordingly went wonderful old staircase; balustrade broad might gone that, almost easily; shady old drawing-room, lighted three four quaint windows I looked street: old oak seats them, seemed come trees shining oak floor, great beams ceiling. It prettily furnished room, piano lively furniture red green, flowers. It seemed old nooks corners; every nook corner queer little table, cupboard, bookcase, seat, something other, made think another good corner room; I looked next one, found equal it, better. On everything air retirement cleanliness marked house outside. Mr. Wickfield tapped door corner panelled wall, girl age came quickly kissed him. On her face, I saw immediately placid sweet expression lady whose picture looked downstairs. It seemed imagination portrait grown womanly, original remained child. Although her face quite bright happy, tranquillity it, her--a quiet, good, calm spirit--that I never forgotten; I shall never forget. This his little housekeeper, his daughter Agnes, Mr. Wickfield said. When I heard he said it, saw he held her hand, I guessed one motive his life was. She little basket-trifle hanging her side, keys it; she looked staid discreet housekeeper old house could have. She listened her father he told her me, pleasant face; he concluded, proposed aunt go upstairs see room. We went together, she us: glorious old room was, oak beams, diamond panes; broad balustrade going way it. I cannot call mind when, childhood, I seen stained glass window church. Nor I recollect subject. But I know I saw her turn round, grave light old staircase, wait us, above, I thought window; I associated something tranquil brightness Agnes Wickfield ever afterwards. My aunt happy I was, arrangement made me; went drawing-room again, well pleased gratified. As she would hear staying dinner, lest she chance fail arrive home grey pony dark; I apprehend Mr. Wickfield knew her well argue point her; lunch provided her there, Agnes went back her governess, Mr. Wickfield his office. So left take leave one another without restraint. She told everything would arranged Mr. Wickfield, I want nothing, gave kindest words best advice. ‘Trot,’ said aunt conclusion, ‘be credit yourself, me, Mr. Dick, Heaven you!’ I greatly overcome, could thank her, again, send love Mr. Dick. ‘Never,’ said aunt, ‘be mean anything; never false; never cruel. Avoid three vices, Trot, I always hopeful you.’ I promised, well I could, I would abuse her kindness forget her admonition. ‘The pony’s door,’ said aunt, ‘and I off! Stay here.’ With words she embraced hastily, went room, shutting door her. At first I startled abrupt departure, almost feared I displeased her; I looked street, saw dejectedly she got chaise, drove away without looking up, I understood her better her injustice. By five of the clock, Mr. Wickfield’s dinner-hour, I mustered spirits again, ready knife fork. The cloth laid us two; Agnes waiting drawing-room dinner, went her father, sat opposite table. I doubted whether he could dined without her. We stay there, dinner, came upstairs drawing-room again: one snug corner which, Agnes set glasses her father, decanter port wine. I thought he would missed usual flavour, put hands. There he sat, taking his wine, taking good deal it, two hours; Agnes played piano, worked, talked me. He was, part, gay cheerful us; sometimes his eyes rested her, he fell brooding state, silent. She always observed quickly, I thought, always roused question caress. Then he came his meditation, drank wine. Agnes made tea, presided it; time passed away it, dinner, she went bed; her father took her his arms kissed her, and, she gone, ordered candles his office. Then I went bed too. But course evening I rambled door, little way along street, I might another peep old houses, grey Cathedral; might think coming old city journey, passing house I lived in, without knowing it. As I came back, I saw Uriah Heep shutting office; feeling friendly towards everybody, went spoke him, parting, gave hand. But oh, clammy hand his was! ghostly touch sight! I rubbed mine afterwards, warm it, AND TO RUB HIS OFF. It uncomfortable hand, that, I went room, still cold wet upon memory. Leaning window, seeing one faces beam-ends looking sideways, I fancied Uriah Heep got somehow, shut hurry. CHAPTER 16. I AM A NEW BOY IN MORE SENSES THAN ONE Next morning, breakfast, I entered school life again. I went, accompanied Mr. Wickfield, scene future studies--a grave building courtyard, learned air seemed well suited stray rooks jackdaws came Cathedral towers walk clerkly bearing grass-plot--and introduced new master, Doctor Strong. Doctor Strong looked almost rusty, thinking, tall iron rails gates outside house; almost stiff heavy great stone urns flanked them, set up, top red-brick wall, regular distances round court, like sublimated skittles, Time play at. He his library (I mean Doctor Strong was), his clothes particularly well brushed, his hair particularly well combed; his knee-smalls unbraced; his long black gaiters unbuttoned; his shoes yawning like two caverns hearth-rug. Turning upon lustreless eye, reminded long-forgotten blind old horse used crop grass, tumble graves, Blunderstone churchyard, he said he glad see me: he gave his hand; I did not know with, nothing itself. But, sitting work, far Doctor Strong, pretty young lady--whom he called Annie, his daughter, I supposed--who got difficulty kneeling put Doctor Strong’s shoes on, button his gaiters, she great cheerfulness quickness. When she finished, going schoolroom, I much surprised hear Mr. Wickfield, bidding her good morning, address her ‘Mrs. Strong’; I wondering could she Doctor Strong’s son’s wife, could she Mrs. Doctor Strong, Doctor Strong unconsciously enlightened me. ‘By by, Wickfield,’ he said, stopping passage his hand shoulder; ‘you found suitable provision wife’s cousin yet?’ ‘No,’ said Mr. Wickfield. ‘No. Not yet.’ ‘I could wish done soon done, Wickfield,’ said Doctor Strong, ‘for Jack Maldon needy, idle; two bad things, worse things sometimes come. What Doctor Watts say,’ he added, looking me, moving his head time his quotation, ‘“Satan finds mischief still, idle hands do.”’ ‘Egad, Doctor,’ returned Mr. Wickfield, ‘if Doctor Watts knew mankind, he might written, much truth, “Satan finds mischief still, busy hands do.” The busy people achieve full share mischief world, may rely upon it. What people about, busiest getting money, getting power, century two? No mischief?’ ‘Jack Maldon never busy getting either, I expect,’ said Doctor Strong, rubbing his chin thoughtfully. ‘Perhaps not,’ said Mr. Wickfield; ‘and bring back question, apology digressing. No, I able dispose Mr. Jack Maldon yet. I believe,’ he said hesitation, ‘I penetrate motive, makes thing difficult.’ ‘My motive,’ returned Doctor Strong, ‘is make suitable provision cousin, old playfellow, Annie’s.’ ‘Yes, I know,’ said Mr. Wickfield; ‘at home abroad.’ ‘Aye!’ replied Doctor, apparently wondering he emphasized words much. ‘At home abroad.’ ‘Your expression, know,’ said Mr. Wickfield. ‘Or abroad.’ ‘Surely,’ Doctor answered. ‘Surely. One other.’ ‘One other? Have choice?’ asked Mr. Wickfield. ‘No,’ returned Doctor. ‘No?’ astonishment. ‘Not least.’ ‘No motive,’ said Mr. Wickfield, ‘for meaning abroad, home?’ ‘No,’ returned Doctor. ‘I bound believe you, course I believe you,’ said Mr. Wickfield. ‘It might simplified office much, I known before. But I confess I entertained another impression.’ Doctor Strong regarded puzzled doubting look, almost immediately subsided smile gave great encouragement; full amiability sweetness, simplicity it, indeed his whole manner, studious, pondering frost upon got through, attractive hopeful young scholar like me. Repeating ‘no’, ‘not least’, short assurances purport, Doctor Strong jogged us, queer, uneven pace; followed: Mr. Wickfield, looking grave, I observed, shaking his head himself, without knowing I saw him. The schoolroom pretty large hall, quietest side house, confronted stately stare half-dozen great urns, commanding peep old secluded garden belonging Doctor, peaches ripening sunny south wall. There two great aloes, tubs, turf outside windows; broad hard leaves plant (looking made painted tin) ever since, association, symbolical silence retirement. About five-and-twenty boys studiously engaged books went in, rose give Doctor good morning, remained standing saw Mr. Wickfield me. ‘A new boy, young gentlemen,’ said Doctor; ‘Trotwood Copperfield.’ One Adams, head-boy, stepped his place welcomed me. He looked like young clergyman, his white cravat, he affable good-humoured; he showed place, presented masters, gentlemanly way would put ease, anything could. It seemed long, however, since I among boys, among companions age, except Mick Walker Mealy Potatoes, I felt strange ever I done life. I conscious passed scenes could knowledge, acquired experiences foreign age, appearance, condition one them, I half believed imposture come ordinary little schoolboy. I become, Murdstone Grinby time, however short long may been, unused sports games boys, I knew I awkward inexperienced commonest things belonging them. Whatever I learnt, slipped away sordid cares life day night, now, I examined I knew, I knew nothing, put lowest form school. But, troubled I was, want boyish skill, book-learning too, I made infinitely uncomfortable consideration, that, I know, I much farther removed companions I not. My mind ran upon would think, knew familiar acquaintance King’s Bench Prison? Was anything would reveal proceedings connexion Micawber family--all pawnings, sellings, suppers--in spite myself? Suppose boys seen coming Canterbury, wayworn ragged, find out? What would say, made light money, could know I scraped halfpence together, purchase daily saveloy beer, slices pudding? How would affect them, innocent London life, London streets, discover knowing I (and ashamed be) meanest phases both? All ran head much, first day Doctor Strong’s, I felt distrustful slightest look gesture; shrunk within whensoever I approached one new schoolfellows; hurried minute school over, afraid committing response friendly notice advance. But influence Mr. Wickfield’s old house, I knocked it, new school-books arm, I began feel uneasiness softening away. As I went airy old room, grave shadow staircase seemed fall upon doubts fears, make past indistinct. I sat there, sturdily conning books, dinner-time (we school good three); went down, hopeful becoming passable sort boy yet. Agnes drawing-room, waiting her father, detained someone his office. She met her pleasant smile, asked I liked school. I told her I like much, I hoped; I little strange first. ‘You never school,’ I said, ‘have you?’ ‘Oh yes! Every day.’ ‘Ah, mean here, home?’ ‘Papa could not spare go anywhere else,’ she answered, smiling shaking her head. ‘His housekeeper must his house, know.’ ‘He fond you, I sure,’ I said. She nodded ‘Yes,’ went door listen his coming up, she might meet stairs. But, he there, she came back again. ‘Mama dead ever since I born,’ she said, her quiet way. ‘I know her picture, downstairs. I saw looking yesterday. Did think whose was?’ I told her yes, like herself. ‘Papa says so, too,’ said Agnes, pleased. ‘Hark! That is papa now!’ Her bright calm face lighted pleasure she went meet him, came in, hand hand. He greeted cordially; told I certainly happy Doctor Strong, one gentlest men. ‘There may some, perhaps--I do not know are--who abuse his kindness,’ said Mr. Wickfield. ‘Never one those, Trotwood, anything. He least suspicious mankind; whether that is merit, whether it is blemish, deserves consideration dealings Doctor, great small.’ He spoke, I thought, he weary, dissatisfied something; I pursue question mind, dinner announced, went took seats before. We scarcely done so, Uriah Heep put his red head his lank hand door, said: ‘Here is Mr. Maldon begs favour word, sir.’ ‘I moment quit Mr. Maldon,’ said his master. ‘Yes, sir,’ returned Uriah; ‘but Mr. Maldon come back, he begs favour word.’ As he held door open his hand, Uriah looked me, looked Agnes, looked dishes, looked plates, looked every object room, I thought,--yet seemed look nothing; he made appearance keeping his red eyes dutifully his master. ‘I beg pardon. It is say, reflection,’ observed voice behind Uriah, Uriah’s head pushed away, speaker’s substituted--‘pray excuse intrusion--that seems I choice matter, sooner I go abroad better. My cousin Annie say, talked it, she liked her friends within reach rather banished, old Doctor--’ ‘Doctor Strong, that?’ Mr. Wickfield interposed, gravely. ‘Doctor Strong, course,’ returned other; ‘I call old Doctor; it is same, know.’ ‘I do not know,’ returned Mr. Wickfield. ‘Well, Doctor Strong,’ said other--‘Doctor Strong mind, I believed. But appears course take he changed his mind, there is said, except sooner I off, better. Therefore, I thought I would come back say, sooner I better. When plunge made water, it is use lingering bank.’ ‘There shall little lingering possible, case, Mr. Maldon, may depend upon it,’ said Mr. Wickfield. ‘Thank’ee,’ said other. ‘Much obliged. I do not want look gift-horse mouth, gracious thing do; otherwise, I dare say, cousin Annie could easily arrange her way. I suppose Annie would say old Doctor--’ ‘Meaning Mrs. Strong would say her husband--do I follow you?’ said Mr. Wickfield. ‘Quite so,’ returned other, ‘--would say, she wanted thing so; would so, matter course.’ ‘And matter course, Mr. Maldon?’ asked Mr. Wickfield, sedately eating his dinner. ‘Why, Annie’s charming young girl, old Doctor--Doctor Strong, I mean--is quite charming young boy,’ said Mr. Jack Maldon, laughing. ‘No offence anybody, Mr. Wickfield. I mean I suppose compensation fair reasonable sort marriage.’ ‘Compensation lady, sir?’ asked Mr. Wickfield gravely. ‘To lady, sir,’ Mr. Jack Maldon answered, laughing. But appearing remark Mr. Wickfield went his dinner sedate, immovable manner, hope making relax muscle his face, he added: ‘However, I said I came say, and, another apology intrusion, I may take off. Of course I shall observe directions, considering matter one arranged solely, referred to, Doctor’s.’ ‘Have dined?’ asked Mr. Wickfield, motion his hand towards table. ‘Thank’ee. I going dine,’ said Mr. Maldon, ‘with cousin Annie. Good-bye!’ Mr. Wickfield, without rising, looked thoughtfully he went out. He rather shallow sort young gentleman, I thought, handsome face, rapid utterance, confident, bold air. And first I ever saw Mr. Jack Maldon; I expected see soon, I heard Doctor speak morning. When dined, went upstairs again, everything went exactly previous day. Agnes set glasses decanters corner, Mr. Wickfield sat drink, drank good deal. Agnes played piano him, sat him, worked talked, played games dominoes me. In good time she made tea; afterwards, I brought books, looked them, showed she knew (which slight matter, though she said was), best way learn understand them. I see her, her modest, orderly, placid manner, I hear her beautiful calm voice, I write words. The influence good, she came exercise later time, begins already descend upon breast. I love little Them’ly, I do not love Agnes--no, way--but I feel goodness, peace, truth, wherever Agnes is; soft light coloured window church, seen long ago, falls her always, I near her, everything around. The time come her withdrawal night, she left us, I gave Mr. Wickfield hand, preparatory going away myself. But he checked said: ‘Should like stay us, Trotwood, go elsewhere?’ ‘To stay,’ I answered, quickly. ‘You sure?’ ‘If please. If I may!’ ‘Why, it is dull life lead here, boy, I afraid,’ he said. ‘Not dull Agnes, sir. Not dull all!’ ‘Than Agnes,’ he repeated, walking slowly great chimney-piece, leaning it. ‘Than Agnes!’ He drank wine evening (or I fancied it), his eyes bloodshot. Not I could see now, cast down, shaded his hand; I noticed little before. ‘Now I wonder,’ he muttered, ‘whether Agnes tires me. When I ever tire her! But that is different, that is quite different.’ He musing, speaking me; I remained quiet. ‘A dull old house,’ he said, ‘and monotonous life; I must her near me. I must keep her near me. If thought I may die leave darling, darling may die leave me, comes like spectre, distress happiest hours, drowned in--’ He supply word; pacing slowly place he sat, mechanically going action pouring wine empty decanter, set paced back again. ‘If miserable bear, she here,’ he said, ‘what would be, she away? No, no, no. I cannot try that.’ He leaned chimney-piece, brooding long I could decide whether run risk disturbing going, remain quietly I was, he come his reverie. At length he aroused himself, looked room his eyes encountered mine. ‘Stay us, Trotwood, eh?’ he said his usual manner, he answering something I said. ‘I glad it. You company us both. It wholesome here. Wholesome me, wholesome Agnes, wholesome perhaps us.’ ‘I sure me, sir,’ I said. ‘I glad here.’ ‘That is fine fellow!’ said Mr. Wickfield. ‘As long glad here, shall stay here.’ He shook hands upon it, clapped back; told I anything night Agnes left us, I wished read pleasure, I free come his room, he I desired company’s sake, sit him. I thanked his consideration; and, he went soon afterwards, I tired, went too, book hand, avail myself, half-an-hour, his permission. But, seeing light little round office, immediately feeling attracted towards Uriah Heep, sort fascination me, I went instead. I found Uriah reading great fat book, demonstrative attention, his lank forefinger followed every line he read, made clammy tracks along page (or I fully believed) like snail. ‘You working late tonight, Uriah,’ says I. ‘Yes, Master Copperfield,’ says Uriah. As I getting stool opposite, talk conveniently, I observed he thing smile him, he could widen his mouth make two hard creases his cheeks, one side, stand one. ‘I office-work, Master Copperfield,’ said Uriah. ‘What work, then?’ I asked. ‘I improving legal knowledge, Master Copperfield,’ said Uriah. ‘I going Tidd’s Practice. Oh, writer Mr. Tidd is, Master Copperfield!’ My stool tower observation, I watched reading again, rapturous exclamation, following lines his forefinger, I observed his nostrils, thin pointed, sharp dints them, singular uncomfortable way expanding contracting themselves--that seemed twinkle instead his eyes, hardly ever twinkled all. ‘I suppose quite great lawyer?’ I said, looking time. ‘Me, Master Copperfield?’ said Uriah. ‘Oh, no! I am umble person.’ It fancy mine his hands, I observed; he frequently ground palms squeeze dry warm, besides often wiping them, stealthy way, his pocket-handkerchief. ‘I well aware I umblest person going,’ said Uriah Heep, modestly; ‘let he may. My mother likewise umble person. We live numble abode, Master Copperfield, much thankful for. My father’s former calling umble. He sexton.’ ‘What he now?’ I asked. ‘He partaker glory present, Master Copperfield,’ said Uriah Heep. ‘But much thankful for. How much I thankful living Mr. Wickfield!’ I asked Uriah he Mr. Wickfield long? ‘I him, going four year, Master Copperfield,’ said Uriah; shutting his book, carefully marking place he left off. ‘Since year father’s death. How much I thankful for, that! How much I thankful for, Mr. Wickfield’s kind intention give articles, would otherwise lay within umble means mother self!’ ‘Then, articled time over, you will regular lawyer, I suppose?’ said I. ‘With blessing Providence, Master Copperfield,’ returned Uriah. ‘Perhaps you will partner Mr. Wickfield’s business, one days,’ I said, make agreeable; ‘and Wickfield Heep, Heep late Wickfield.’ ‘Oh no, Master Copperfield,’ returned Uriah, shaking his head, ‘I much umble that!’ He certainly look uncommonly like carved face beam outside window, he sat, his humility, eyeing sideways, his mouth widened, creases his cheeks. ‘Mr. Wickfield excellent man, Master Copperfield,’ said Uriah. ‘If known long, know it, I sure, much better I inform you.’ I replied I certain he was; I known long myself, though he friend aunt’s. ‘Oh, indeed, Master Copperfield,’ said Uriah. ‘Your aunt sweet lady, Master Copperfield!’ He way writhing he wanted express enthusiasm, ugly; diverted attention compliment he paid relation, snaky twistings his throat body. ‘A sweet lady, Master Copperfield!’ said Uriah Heep. ‘She great admiration Miss Agnes, Master Copperfield, I believe?’ I said, ‘Yes,’ boldly; I knew anything it, Heaven forgive me! ‘I hope have, too, Master Copperfield,’ said Uriah. ‘But I sure must have.’ ‘Everybody must have,’ I returned. ‘Oh, thank you, Master Copperfield,’ said Uriah Heep, ‘for remark! It true! Umble I am, I know true! Oh, thank you, Master Copperfield!’ He writhed quite his stool excitement his feelings, and, off, began make arrangements going home. ‘Mother expecting me,’ he said, referring pale, inexpressive-faced watch his pocket, ‘and getting uneasy; though umble, Master Copperfield, much attached one another. If would come see us, afternoon, take cup tea lowly dwelling, mother would proud company I be.’ I said I glad come. ‘Thank you, Master Copperfield,’ returned Uriah, putting his book away upon shelf--‘I suppose stop here, time, Master Copperfield?’ I said I going brought there, I believed, long I remained school. ‘Oh, indeed!’ exclaimed Uriah. ‘I think YOU would come business last, Master Copperfield!’ I protested I views sort, scheme entertained behalf anybody; Uriah insisted blandly replying assurances, ‘Oh, yes, Master Copperfield, I think would, indeed!’ and, ‘Oh, indeed, Master Copperfield, I think would, certainly!’ again. Being, last, ready leave office night, he asked would suit convenience light put out; answering ‘Yes,’ instantly extinguished it. After shaking hands me--his hand felt like fish, dark--he opened door street little, crept out, shut it, leaving grope way back house: cost trouble fall his stool. This proximate because, I suppose, dreaming him, appeared half night; dreaming, among things, he launched Mr. Peggotty’s house piratical expedition, black flag masthead, bearing inscription ‘Tidd’s Practice’, diabolical ensign he carrying little Them’ly Spanish Main, drowned. I got little better uneasiness I went school next day, good deal better next day, shook degrees, less fortnight I quite home, happy, among new companions. I awkward enough games, backward enough studies; custom would improve first respect, I hoped, hard work second. Accordingly, I went work hard, play earnest, gained great commendation. And, little while, Murdstone Grinby life became strange I hardly believed it, present life grew familiar, I seemed leading long time. Doctor Strong’s excellent school; different Mr. Creakle’s good evil. It gravely decorously ordered, sound system; appeal, everything, honour good faith boys, avowed intention rely possession qualities unless proved unworthy it, worked wonders. We felt part management place, sustaining character dignity. Hence, soon became warmly attached it--I sure I one, I never knew, time, boy otherwise--and learnt good will, desiring credit. We noble games hours, plenty liberty; even then, I remember, well spoken town, rarely disgrace, appearance manner, reputation Doctor Strong Doctor Strong’s boys. Some higher scholars boarded Doctor’s house, I learned, second hand, particulars Doctor’s history--as, he yet married twelve months beautiful young lady I seen study, he married love; she sixpence, world poor relations (so fellows said) ready swarm Doctor house home. Also, Doctor’s cogitating manner attributable his always engaged looking Greek roots; which, innocence ignorance, I supposed botanical furor Doctor’s part, especially he always looked ground he walked about, I understood roots words, view new Dictionary he contemplation. Adams, head-boy, turn mathematics, made calculation, I informed, time Dictionary would take completing, Doctor’s plan, Doctor’s rate going. He considered might done one thousand six hundred forty-nine years, counting Doctor’s last, sixty-second, birthday. But Doctor idol whole school: must badly composed school he anything else, he kindest men; simple faith might touched stone hearts urns upon wall. As he walked part courtyard side house, stray rooks jackdaws looking heads cocked slyly, knew much knowing worldly affairs he, sort vagabond could get near enough his creaking shoes attract his attention one sentence tale distress, vagabond made next two days. It notorious house, masters head-boys took pains cut marauders angles, get windows, turn courtyard, could make Doctor aware presence; sometimes happily effected within yards him, without his knowing anything matter, he jogged fro. Outside his domain, unprotected, he sheep shearers. He would taken his gaiters his legs, give away. In fact, story current among us (I idea, never had, authority, I believed many years I feel quite certain true), frosty day, one winter-time, he actually bestow his gaiters beggar-woman, occasioned scandal neighbourhood exhibiting fine infant door door, wrapped garments, universally recognized, well known vicinity Cathedral. The legend added person identify Doctor himself, who, shortly afterwards displayed door little second-hand shop good repute, things taken exchange gin, observed handle approvingly, admiring curious novelty pattern, considering improvement his own. It pleasant see Doctor his pretty young wife. He fatherly, benignant way showing his fondness her, seemed express good man. I often saw walking garden peaches were, I sometimes nearer observation study parlour. She appeared take great care Doctor, like much, though I never thought her vitally interested Dictionary: cumbrous fragments work Doctor always carried his pockets, lining his hat, generally seemed expounding her walked about. I saw good deal Mrs. Strong, she taken liking morning introduction Doctor, always afterwards kind me, interested me; she fond Agnes, often backwards forwards house. There curious constraint her Mr. Wickfield, I thought (of she seemed afraid), never wore off. When she came evening, she always shrunk accepting his escort home, ran away instead. And sometimes, running gaily across Cathedral yard together, expecting meet nobody, would meet Mr. Jack Maldon, always surprised see us. Mrs. Strong’s mama lady I took great delight in. Her name Mrs. Markleham; boys used call her Old Soldier, account her generalship, skill she marshalled great forces relations Doctor. She little, sharp-eyed woman, used wear, she dressed, one unchangeable cap, ornamented artificial flowers, two artificial butterflies supposed hovering flowers. There superstition among us cap come France, could originate workmanship ingenious nation: I certainly know it, is, always made appearance evening, wheresoever Mrs. Markleham made HER appearance; carried friendly meetings Hindoo basket; butterflies gift trembling constantly; improved shining hours Doctor Strong’s expense, like busy bees. I observed Old Soldier--not adopt name disrespectfully--to pretty good advantage, night made memorable something else I shall relate. It night little party Doctor’s, given occasion Mr. Jack Maldon’s departure India, whither he going cadet, something kind: Mr. Wickfield length arranged business. It happened Doctor’s birthday, too. We holiday, made presents morning, made speech head-boy, cheered hoarse, he she would tears. And now, evening, Mr. Wickfield, Agnes, I, went tea his private capacity. Mr. Jack Maldon there, us. Mrs. Strong, dressed white, cherry-coloured ribbons, playing piano, went in; he leaning her turn leaves. The clear red white her complexion blooming flower-like usual, I thought, she turned round; she looked pretty, Wonderfully pretty. ‘I forgotten, Doctor,’ said Mrs. Strong’s mama, seated, ‘to pay compliments day--though are, may suppose, far mere compliments case. Allow wish many happy returns.’ ‘I thank you, madam,’ replied Doctor. ‘Many, many, many, happy returns,’ said Old Soldier. ‘Not sake, Annie’s, John Maldon’s, many people’s. It seems yesterday me, John, little creature, head shorter Master Copperfield, making baby love Annie behind gooseberry bushes back-garden.’ ‘My dear mama,’ said Mrs. Strong, ‘never mind now.’ ‘Annie, do not absurd,’ returned her mother. ‘If blush hear things old married woman, blush hear them?’ ‘Old?’ exclaimed Mr. Jack Maldon. ‘Annie? Come!’ ‘Yes, John,’ returned Soldier. ‘Virtually, old married woman. Although old years--for ever hear say, ever heard say, girl twenty old years!--your cousin wife Doctor, and, such, I described her. It well you, John, cousin wife Doctor. You found influential kind friend, kinder yet, I venture predict, deserve it. I false pride. I never hesitate admit, frankly, members family want friend. You one yourself, cousin’s influence raised one you.’ The Doctor, goodness his heart, waved his hand make light it, save Mr. Jack Maldon reminder. But Mrs. Markleham changed her chair one next Doctor’s, putting her fan his coat-sleeve, said: ‘No, really, dear Doctor, must excuse I appear dwell rather, I feel strongly. I call quite monomania, subject mine. You blessing us. You really Boon, know.’ ‘Nonsense, nonsense,’ said Doctor. ‘No, no, I beg pardon,’ retorted Old Soldier. ‘With nobody present, dear confidential friend Mr. Wickfield, I cannot consent put down. I shall begin assert privileges mother-in-law, go like that, scold you. I perfectly honest outspoken. What I saying, I said first overpowered surprise--you remember surprised I was?--by proposing Annie. Not anything much way, mere fact proposal--it would ridiculous say that!--but because, known her poor father, known her baby six months old, I had not thought light all, indeed marrying man way,--simply that, know.’ ‘Aye, aye,’ returned Doctor, good-humouredly. ‘Never mind.’ ‘But I DO mind,’ said Old Soldier, laying her fan upon his lips. ‘I mind much. I recall things I may contradicted I wrong. Well! Then I spoke Annie, I told her happened. I said, “My dear, here is Doctor Strong positively made subject handsome declaration offer.” Did I press least? No. I said, “Now, Annie, tell truth moment; heart free?” “Mama,” she said crying, “I extremely young”--which perfectly true--“and I hardly know I heart all.” “Then, dear,” I said, “you may rely upon it, it is free. At events, love,” said I, “Doctor Strong agitated state mind, must answered. He cannot kept his present state suspense.” “Mama,” said Annie, still crying, “would he unhappy without me? If he would, I honour respect much, I think I him.” So settled. And then, till then, I said Annie, “Annie, Doctor Strong husband, he represent late father: he represent head family, he represent wisdom station, I may say means, family; be, short, Boon it.” I used word time, I used again, today. If I merit consistency.’ The daughter sat quite silent still speech, her eyes fixed ground; her cousin standing near her, looking ground too. She said softly, trembling voice: ‘Mama, I hope finished?’ ‘No, dear Annie,’ returned Old Soldier, ‘I quite finished. Since ask me, love, I reply I not. I complain really little unnatural towards family; and, use complaining you. I mean complain husband. Now, dear Doctor, look silly wife yours.’ As Doctor turned his kind face, smile simplicity gentleness, towards her, she drooped her head more. I noticed Mr. Wickfield looked her steadily. ‘When I happened say naughty thing, day,’ pursued her mother, shaking her head her fan her, playfully, ‘that family circumstance she might mention you--indeed, I think, bound mention--she said, mention ask favour; that, generous, her ask always have, she would not.’ ‘Annie, dear,’ said Doctor. ‘That wrong. It robbed pleasure.’ ‘Almost words I said her!’ exclaimed her mother. ‘Now really, another time, I know she would tell reason, will not, I great mind, dear Doctor, tell myself.’ ‘I shall glad will,’ returned Doctor. ‘Shall I?’ ‘Certainly.’ ‘Well, then, I will!’ said Old Soldier. ‘That is bargain.’ And having, I suppose, carried her point, she tapped Doctor’s hand several times her fan (which she kissed first), returned triumphantly her former station. Some company coming in, among two masters Adams, talk became general; naturally turned Mr. Jack Maldon, his voyage, country he going to, his various plans prospects. He leave night, supper, post-chaise, Gravesend; ship, he make voyage, lay; gone--unless he came home leave, his health--I do not know many years. I recollect settled general consent India quite misrepresented country, nothing objectionable it, tiger two, little heat warm part day. For part, I looked Mr. Jack Maldon modern Sindbad, pictured bosom friend Rajahs East, sitting canopies, smoking curly golden pipes--a mile long, could straightened out. Mrs. Strong pretty singer: I knew, often heard her singing herself. But, whether she afraid singing people, voice evening, certain she could not sing all. She tried duet, once, her cousin Maldon, could much begin; afterwards, she tried sing herself, although she began sweetly, her voice died away sudden, left her quite distressed, her head hanging keys. The good Doctor said she nervous, and, relieve her, proposed round game cards; he knew much art playing trombone. But I remarked Old Soldier took custody directly, her partner; instructed him, first preliminary initiation, give her silver he his pocket. We merry game, made less merry Doctor’s mistakes, he committed innumerable quantity, spite watchfulness butterflies, great aggravation. Mrs. Strong declined play, ground feeling well; her cousin Maldon excused he packing do. When he done it, however, he returned, sat together, talking, sofa. From time time she came looked Doctor’s hand, told play. She pale, she bent him, I thought her finger trembled she pointed cards; Doctor quite happy her attention, took notice this, so. At supper, hardly gay. Everyone appeared feel parting sort awkward thing, nearer approached, awkward was. Mr. Jack Maldon tried talkative, his ease, made matters worse. And improved, appeared me, Old Soldier: continually recalled passages Mr. Jack Maldon’s youth. The Doctor, however, felt, I sure, he making everybody happy, well pleased, suspicion utmost height enjoyment. ‘Annie, dear,’ said he, looking his watch, filling his glass, ‘it past cousin Jack’s time, must detain him, since time tide--both concerned case--wait man. Mr. Jack Maldon, long voyage, strange country, you; many men both, many men both, end time. The winds going tempt, wafted thousands upon thousands fortune, brought thousands upon thousands happily back.’ ‘It is affecting thing,’ said Mrs. Markleham--‘however it is viewed, it is affecting, see fine young man one known infant, going away end world, leaving he knows behind, knowing what is him. A young man really well deserves constant support patronage,’ looking Doctor, ‘who makes sacrifices.’ ‘Time go fast you, Mr. Jack Maldon,’ pursued Doctor, ‘and fast us. Some us hardly expect, perhaps, natural course things, greet return. The next best thing hope it, that is case. I shall weary good advice. You long good model you, cousin Annie. Imitate her virtues nearly can.’ Mrs. Markleham fanned herself, shook her head. ‘Farewell, Mr. Jack,’ said Doctor, standing up; stood up. ‘A prosperous voyage out, thriving career abroad, happy return home!’ We drank toast, shook hands Mr. Jack Maldon; he hastily took leave ladies there, hurried door, he received, he got chaise, tremendous broadside cheers discharged boys, assembled lawn purpose. Running among swell ranks, I near chaise rolled away; I lively impression made upon me, midst noise dust, seen Mr. Jack Maldon rattle past agitated face, something cherry-coloured his hand. After another broadside Doctor, another Doctor’s wife, boys dispersed, I went back house, I found guests standing group Doctor, discussing Mr. Jack Maldon gone away, he borne it, he felt it, rest it. In midst remarks, Mrs. Markleham cried: ‘Where is Annie?’ No Annie there; called her, Annie replied. But pressing room, crowd, see matter, found her lying hall floor. There great alarm first, found she swoon, swoon yielding usual means recovery; Doctor, lifted her head upon his knee, put her curls aside his hand, said, looking around: ‘Poor Annie! She is faithful tender-hearted! It is parting her old playfellow friend--her favourite cousin--that done this. Ah! It is pity! I sorry!’ When she opened her eyes, saw she was, standing her, she arose assistance: turning her head, she so, lay Doctor’s shoulder--or hide it, I do not know which. We went drawing-room, leave her Doctor her mother; she said, seemed, she better she since morning, she would rather brought among us; brought her in, looking white weak, I thought, sat her sofa. ‘Annie, dear,’ said her mother, something her dress. ‘See here! You lost bow. Will anybody good find ribbon; cherry-coloured ribbon?’ It one she worn her bosom. We looked it; I looked everywhere, I certain--but nobody could find it. ‘Do recollect last, Annie?’ said her mother. I wondered I could thought she looked white, anything burning red, she answered she safe, little ago, she thought, worth looking for. Nevertheless, looked again, still found. She entreated might searching; still sought for, desultory way, she quite well, company took departure. We walked slowly home, Mr. Wickfield, Agnes, I--Agnes I admiring moonlight, Mr. Wickfield scarcely raising his eyes ground. When we, last, reached door, Agnes discovered she left her little reticule behind. Delighted service her, I ran back fetch it. I went supper-room left, deserted dark. But door communication Doctor’s study, light, open, I passed there, say I wanted, get candle. The Doctor sitting his easy-chair fireside, his young wife stool his feet. The Doctor, complacent smile, reading aloud manuscript explanation statement theory interminable Dictionary, she looking him. But face I never saw. It beautiful form, ashy pale, fixed abstraction, full wild, sleep-walking, dreamy horror I do not know what. The eyes wide open, her brown hair fell two rich clusters her shoulders, her white dress, disordered want lost ribbon. Distinctly I recollect her look, I cannot say expressive, I cannot even say expressive now, rising older judgement. Penitence, humiliation, shame, pride, love, trustfulness--I see all; all, I see horror I do not know what. My entrance, saying I wanted, roused her. It disturbed Doctor too, I went back replace candle I taken table, he patting her head, his fatherly way, saying he merciless drone let her tempt reading on; he would her go bed. But she asked him, rapid, urgent manner, let her stay--to let her feel assured (I heard her murmur broken words effect) she his confidence night. And, she turned towards him, glancing I left room went door, I saw her cross her hands upon his knee, look face, something quieted, he resumed his reading. It made great impression me, I remembered long time afterwards; I shall occasion narrate time comes. CHAPTER 17. SOMEBODY TURNS UP It occurred mention Peggotty since I ran away; but, course, I wrote her letter almost soon I housed Dover, another, longer letter, containing particulars fully related, aunt took formally her protection. On settled Doctor Strong’s I wrote her again, detailing happy condition prospects. I never could derived anything like pleasure spending money Mr. Dick given me, I felt sending gold half-guinea Peggotty, per post, enclosed last letter, discharge sum I borrowed her: epistle, before, I mentioned young man donkey-cart. To communications Peggotty replied promptly, concisely, merchant’s clerk. Her utmost powers expression (which certainly great ink) exhausted attempt write she felt subject journey. Four sides incoherent interjectional beginnings sentences, end, except blots, inadequate afford her relief. But blots expressive best composition; showed Peggotty crying paper, could I desired more? I made out, without much difficulty, she could take quite kindly aunt yet. The notice short long prepossession way. We never knew person, she wrote; think Miss Betsey seem different she thought be, Moral!--that her word. She evidently still afraid Miss Betsey, she sent her grateful duty her timidly; she evidently afraid me, too, entertained probability running away soon: I might judge repeated hints she threw out, coach-fare Yarmouth always her asking. She gave one piece intelligence affected much, namely, sale furniture old home, Mr. Miss Murdstone gone away, house shut up, let sold. God knows I part remained there, pained think dear old place altogether abandoned; weeds growing tall garden, fallen leaves lying thick wet upon paths. I imagined winds winter would howl round it, cold rain would beat upon window-glass, moon would make ghosts walls empty rooms, watching solitude night. I thought afresh grave churchyard, underneath tree: seemed house dead too, now, connected father mother faded away. There news Peggotty’s letters. Mr. Barkis excellent husband, she said, though still little near; faults, she plenty (though I sure I do not know were); he sent his duty, little bedroom always ready me. Mr. Peggotty well, Ham well, Mrs. Gummidge poorly, little Them’ly would not send her love, said Peggotty might send it, she liked. All intelligence I dutifully imparted aunt, reserving mention little Them’ly, I instinctively felt she would tenderly incline. While I yet new Doctor Strong’s, she made several excursions Canterbury see me, always unseasonable hours: view, I suppose, taking surprise. But, finding well employed, bearing good character, hearing hands I rose fast school, she soon discontinued visits. I saw her Saturday, every third fourth week, I went Dover treat; I saw Mr. Dick every alternate Wednesday, he arrived stage-coach noon, stay next morning. On occasions Mr. Dick never travelled without leathern writing-desk, containing supply stationery Memorial; relation document he notion time beginning press now, really must got hand. Mr. Dick partial gingerbread. To render his visits agreeable, aunt instructed open credit cake shop, hampered stipulation he served one shilling’s-worth course one day. This, reference his little bills county inn he slept, aunt, paid, induced suspect he allowed rattle his money, spend it. I found investigation so, least agreement aunt he account her his disbursements. As he idea deceiving her, always desired please her, he thus made chary launching expense. On point, well possible points, Mr. Dick convinced aunt wisest wonderful women; he repeatedly told infinite secrecy, always whisper. ‘Trotwood,’ said Mr. Dick, air mystery, imparting confidence me, one Wednesday; ‘who is man hides near house frightens her?’ ‘Frightens aunt, sir?’ Mr. Dick nodded. ‘I thought nothing would frightened her,’ he said, ‘for she is--’ he whispered softly, ‘do not mention it--the wisest wonderful women.’ Having said which, he drew back, observe effect description her made upon me. ‘The first time he came,’ said Mr. Dick, ‘was--let see--sixteen hundred forty-nine date King Charles’s execution. I think said sixteen hundred forty-nine?’ ‘Yes, sir.’ ‘I do not know be,’ said Mr. Dick, sorely puzzled shaking his head. ‘I do not think I old that.’ ‘Was year man appeared, sir?’ I asked. ‘Why, really’ said Mr. Dick, ‘I do not see year, Trotwood. Did get date history?’ ‘Yes, sir.’ ‘I suppose history never lies, it?’ said Mr. Dick, gleam hope. ‘Oh dear, no, sir!’ I replied, decisively. I ingenuous young, I thought so. ‘I cannot make out,’ said Mr. Dick, shaking his head. ‘There is something wrong, somewhere. However, soon mistake made putting trouble King Charles’s head head, man first came. I walking Miss Trotwood tea, dark, he was, close house.’ ‘Walking about?’ I inquired. ‘Walking about?’ repeated Mr. Dick. ‘Let see, I must recollect bit. N-no, no; he walking about.’ I asked, shortest way get it, he WAS doing. ‘Well, he was not all,’ said Mr. Dick, ‘until he came behind her, whispered. Then she turned round fainted, I stood still looked him, he walked away; he hiding ever since (in ground somewhere), extraordinary thing!’ ‘HAS he hiding ever since?’ I asked. ‘To sure he has,’ retorted Mr. Dick, nodding his head gravely. ‘Never came out, till last night! We walking last night, he came behind her again, I knew again.’ ‘And he frighten aunt again?’ ‘All shiver,’ said Mr. Dick, counterfeiting affection making his teeth chatter. ‘Held palings. Cried. But, Trotwood, come here,’ getting close him, he might whisper softly; ‘why she give money, boy, moonlight?’ ‘He beggar, perhaps.’ Mr. Dick shook his head, utterly renouncing suggestion; replied great many times, great confidence, ‘No beggar, beggar, beggar, sir!’ went say, his window he afterwards, late night, seen aunt give person money outside garden rails moonlight, slunk away--into ground again, he thought probable--and seen more: aunt came hurriedly secretly back house, had, even morning, quite different her usual self; preyed Mr. Dick’s mind. I least belief, outset story, unknown anything delusion Mr. Dick’s, one line ill-fated Prince occasioned much difficulty; reflection I began entertain question whether attempt, threat attempt, might twice made take poor Mr. Dick aunt’s protection, whether aunt, strength whose kind feeling towards I knew herself, might induced pay price his peace quiet. As I already much attached Mr. Dick, solicitous his welfare, fears favoured supposition; long time his Wednesday hardly ever came round, without entertaining misgiving he would coach-box usual. There he always appeared, however, grey-headed, laughing, happy; he never anything tell man could frighten aunt. These Wednesdays happiest days Mr. Dick’s life; far least happy mine. He soon became known every boy school; though he never took active part game kite-flying, deeply interested sports anyone among us. How often I seen him, intent upon match marbles pegtop, looking face unutterable interest, hardly breathing critical times! How often, hare hounds, I seen mounted little knoll, cheering whole field action, waving his hat his grey head, oblivious King Charles Martyr’s head, belonging it! How many summer hour I known blissful minutes cricket-field! How many winter days I seen him, standing blue-nosed, snow east wind, looking boys going long slide, clapping his worsted gloves rapture! He universal favourite, his ingenuity little things transcendent. He could cut oranges devices none us idea of. He could make boat anything, skewer upwards. He could turn cramp-bones chessmen; fashion Roman chariots old court cards; make spoked wheels cotton reels, bird-cages old wire. But he greatest all, perhaps, articles string straw; persuaded he could anything could done hands. Mr. Dick’s renown long confined us. After Wednesdays, Doctor Strong made inquiries him, I told aunt told me; interested Doctor much he requested, occasion his next visit, presented him. This ceremony I performed; Doctor begging Mr. Dick, whensoever he find coach office, come there, rest morning’s work over, soon passed custom Mr. Dick come matter course, and, little late, often happened Wednesday, walk courtyard, waiting me. Here he made acquaintance Doctor’s beautiful young wife (paler formerly, time; rarely seen anyone, I think; gay, less beautiful), became familiar degrees, until, last, he would come school wait. He always sat particular corner, particular stool, called ‘Dick’, him; he would sit, his grey head bent forward, attentively listening whatever might going on, profound veneration learning he never able acquire. This veneration Mr. Dick extended Doctor, he thought subtle accomplished philosopher age. It long Mr. Dick ever spoke otherwise bareheaded; even he Doctor struck quite friendship, would walk together hour, side courtyard known among us The Doctor’s Walk, Mr. Dick would pull his hat intervals show his respect wisdom knowledge. How ever came Doctor began read scraps famous Dictionary, walks, I never knew; perhaps he felt same, first, reading himself. However, passed custom too; Mr. Dick, listening face shining pride pleasure, his heart hearts believed Dictionary delightful book world. As I think going schoolroom windows--the Doctor reading his complacent smile, occasional flourish manuscript, grave motion his head; Mr. Dick listening, enchained interest, his poor wits calmly wandering God knows where, upon wings hard words--I think one pleasantest things, quiet way, I ever seen. I feel might go walking fro ever, world might somehow better it--as thousand things makes noise about, one half good it, me. Agnes one Mr. Dick’s friends, soon; often coming house, he made acquaintance Uriah. The friendship increased continually, maintained odd footing: that, Mr. Dick came professedly look guardian, he always consulted little matter doubt arose, invariably guided advice; high respect native sagacity, considering I inherited good deal aunt. One Thursday morning, I walk Mr. Dick hotel coach office going back school (for hour’s school breakfast), I met Uriah street, reminded promise I made take tea his mother: adding, writhe, ‘But I did not expect keep it, Master Copperfield, we are umble.’ I really yet able make mind whether I liked Uriah detested him; I doubtful still, I stood looking face street. But I felt quite affront supposed proud, said I wanted asked. ‘Oh, that is all, Master Copperfield,’ said Uriah, ‘and really is not umbleness prevents you, come evening? But umbleness, I hope will not mind owning it, Master Copperfield; well aware condition.’ I said I would mention Mr. Wickfield, he approved, I doubt he would, I would come pleasure. So, six of the clock evening, one early office evenings, I announced ready, Uriah. ‘Mother proud, indeed,’ he said, walked away together. ‘Or she would proud, was not sinful, Master Copperfield.’ ‘Yet did not mind supposing I proud morning,’ I returned. ‘Oh dear, no, Master Copperfield!’ returned Uriah. ‘Oh, believe me, no! Such thought never came head! I should not deemed proud thought US umble you. Because umble.’ ‘Have studying much law lately?’ I asked, change subject. ‘Oh, Master Copperfield,’ he said, air self-denial, ‘my reading hardly called study. I passed hour two evening, sometimes, Mr. Tidd.’ ‘Rather hard, I suppose?’ said I. ‘He hard sometimes,’ returned Uriah. ‘But I do not know he might gifted person.’ After beating little tune his chin he walked on, two forefingers his skeleton right hand, he added: ‘There expressions, see, Master Copperfield--Latin words terms--in Mr. Tidd, trying reader umble attainments.’ ‘Would like taught Latin?’ I said briskly. ‘I teach pleasure, I learn it.’ ‘Oh, thank you, Master Copperfield,’ he answered, shaking his head. ‘I sure it is kind make offer, I much umble accept it.’ ‘What nonsense, Uriah!’ ‘Oh, indeed must excuse me, Master Copperfield! I greatly obliged, I like things, I assure you; I far umble. There people enough tread upon lowly state, without outrage feelings possessing learning. Learning are not me. A person like better aspire. If he get life, he must get umbly, Master Copperfield!’ I never saw his mouth wide, creases his cheeks deep, he delivered sentiments: shaking his head time, writhing modestly. ‘I think wrong, Uriah,’ I said. ‘I dare say several things I could teach you, would like learn them.’ ‘Oh, I do not doubt that, Master Copperfield,’ he answered; ‘not least. But umble yourself, do not judge well, perhaps, are. I will not provoke betters knowledge, thank you. I am much umble. Here umble dwelling, Master Copperfield!’ We entered low, old-fashioned room, walked straight street, found Mrs. Heep, dead image Uriah, short. She received utmost humility, apologized giving her son kiss, observing that, lowly were, natural affections, hoped would give offence anyone. It perfectly decent room, half parlour half kitchen, snug room. The tea-things set upon table, kettle boiling hob. There chest drawers escritoire top, Uriah read write evening; Uriah’s blue bag lying vomiting papers; company Uriah’s books commanded Mr. Tidd; corner cupboard: usual articles furniture. I do not remember individual object bare, pinched, spare look; I remember whole place had. It perhaps part Mrs. Heep’s humility, she still wore weeds. Notwithstanding lapse time occurred since Mr. Heep’s decease, she still wore weeds. I think compromise cap; otherwise she weedy early days her mourning. ‘This day remembered, Uriah, I sure,’ said Mrs. Heep, making tea, ‘when Master Copperfield pays us visit.’ ‘I said you would think so, mother,’ said Uriah. ‘If I could wished father remain among us reason,’ said Mrs. Heep, ‘it would been, he might known his company afternoon.’ I felt embarrassed compliments; I sensible, too, entertained honoured guest, I thought Mrs. Heep agreeable woman. ‘My Uriah,’ said Mrs. Heep, ‘has looked forward this, sir, long while. He his fears umbleness stood way, I joined myself. Umble are, umble been, umble shall ever be,’ said Mrs. Heep. ‘I sure occasion so, madam,’ I said, ‘unless like.’ ‘Thank you, sir,’ retorted Mrs. Heep. ‘We know station thankful it.’ I found Mrs. Heep gradually got nearer me, Uriah gradually got opposite me, respectfully plied choicest eatables table. There nothing particularly choice there, sure; I took deed, felt attentive. Presently began talk aunts, I told mine; fathers mothers, I told mine; Mrs. Heep began talk fathers-in-law, I began tell her mine--but stopped, aunt advised observe silence subject. A tender young cork, however, would chance pair corkscrews, tender young tooth pair dentists, little shuttlecock two battledores, I Uriah Mrs. Heep. They liked me; wormed things I desire tell, certainty I blush think of, especially, juvenile frankness, I took credit confidential felt I quite patron two respectful entertainers. They fond one another: certain. I take it, effect upon me, touch nature; skill one followed whatever said, touch art I still less proof against. When nothing got (for Murdstone Grinby life, journey, I dumb), began Mr. Wickfield Agnes. Uriah threw ball Mrs. Heep, Mrs. Heep caught threw back Uriah, Uriah kept little while, sent back Mrs. Heep, went tossing I idea got it, quite bewildered. The ball always changing too. Now Mr. Wickfield, Agnes, excellence Mr. Wickfield, admiration Agnes; extent Mr. Wickfield’s business resources, domestic life dinner; now, wine Mr. Wickfield took, reason he took it, pity he took much; one thing, another, everything once; time, without appearing speak often, anything sometimes encourage little, fear overcome humility honour company, I found perpetually letting something I business let seeing effect twinkling Uriah’s dinted nostrils. I begun little uncomfortable, wish well visit, figure coming street passed door--it stood open air room, warm, weather close time year--came back again, looked in, walked in, exclaiming loudly, ‘Copperfield! Is possible?’ It Mr. Micawber! It Mr. Micawber, his eye-glass, his walking-stick, his shirt-collar, his genteel air, condescending roll his voice, complete! ‘My dear Copperfield,’ said Mr. Micawber, putting his hand, ‘this indeed meeting calculated impress mind sense instability uncertainty human--in short, extraordinary meeting. Walking along street, reflecting upon probability something turning (of I present rather sanguine), I find young valued friend turn up, connected eventful period life; I may say, turning-point existence. Copperfield, dear fellow, do?’ I cannot say--I really cannot say--that I glad see Mr. Micawber there; I glad see too, shook hands him, heartily, inquiring Mrs. Micawber was. ‘Thank you,’ said Mr. Micawber, waving his hand old, settling his chin his shirt-collar. ‘She tolerably convalescent. The twins longer derive sustenance Nature’s founts--in short,’ said Mr. Micawber, one his bursts confidence, ‘they weaned--and Mrs. Micawber is, present, travelling companion. She rejoiced, Copperfield, renew her acquaintance one proved respects worthy minister sacred altar friendship.’ I said I delighted see her. ‘You good,’ said Mr. Micawber. Mr. Micawber smiled, settled his chin again, looked him. ‘I discovered friend Copperfield,’ said Mr. Micawber genteelly, without addressing particularly anyone, ‘not solitude, partaking social meal company widow lady, one apparently her offspring--in short,’ said Mr. Micawber, another his bursts confidence, ‘her son. I shall esteem honour presented.’ I could less, circumstances, make Mr. Micawber known Uriah Heep his mother; I accordingly did. As abased him, Mr. Micawber took seat, waved his hand his courtly manner. ‘Any friend friend Copperfield’s,’ said Mr. Micawber, ‘has personal claim upon myself.’ ‘We umble, sir,’ said Mrs. Heep, ‘my son me, friends Master Copperfield. He good take his tea us, thankful his company, also you, sir, notice.’ ‘Madam,’ returned Mr. Micawber, bow, ‘you obliging: doing, Copperfield? Still wine trade?’ I excessively anxious get Mr. Micawber away; replied, hat hand, red face, I doubt, I pupil Doctor Strong’s. ‘A pupil?’ said Mr. Micawber, raising his eyebrows. ‘I extremely happy hear it. Although mind like friend Copperfield’s’--to Uriah Mrs. Heep--‘does require cultivation which, without his knowledge men things, would require, still rich soil teeming latent vegetation--in short,’ said Mr. Micawber, smiling, another burst confidence, ‘it intellect capable getting classics extent.’ Uriah, his long hands slowly twining one another, made ghastly writhe waist upwards, express his concurrence estimation me. ‘Shall go see Mrs. Micawber, sir?’ I said, get Mr. Micawber away. ‘If her favour, Copperfield,’ replied Mr. Micawber, rising. ‘I scruple saying, presence friends here, I man has, years, contended pressure pecuniary difficulties.’ I knew he certain say something kind; he always would boastful his difficulties. ‘Sometimes I risen superior difficulties. Sometimes difficulties have--in short, floored me. There times I administered succession facers them; times many me, I given in, said Mrs. Micawber, words Cato, “Plato, thou reasonest well. It is now. I show fight more.” But time life,’ said Mr. Micawber, ‘have I enjoyed higher degree satisfaction pouring griefs (if I may describe difficulties, chiefly arising warrants attorney promissory notes two four months, word) bosom friend Copperfield.’ Mr. Micawber closed handsome tribute saying, ‘Mr. Heep! Good evening. Mrs. Heep! Your servant,’ walking his fashionable manner, making good deal noise pavement his shoes, humming tune went. It little inn Mr. Micawber put up, he occupied little room it, partitioned commercial room, strongly flavoured tobacco-smoke. I think kitchen, warm greasy smell appeared come chinks floor, flabby perspiration walls. I know near bar, account smell spirits jingling glasses. Here, recumbent small sofa, underneath picture race-horse, her head close fire, her feet pushing mustard dumb-waiter end room, Mrs. Micawber, Mr. Micawber entered first, saying, ‘My dear, allow introduce pupil Doctor Strong’s.’ I noticed, by, although Mr. Micawber much confused ever age standing, he always remembered, genteel thing, I pupil Doctor Strong’s. Mrs. Micawber amazed, glad see me. I glad see her too, and, affectionate greeting sides, sat small sofa near her. ‘My dear,’ said Mr. Micawber, ‘if mention Copperfield present position is, I doubt he like know, I go look paper while, see whether anything turns among advertisements.’ ‘I thought Plymouth, madam,’ I said Mrs. Micawber, he went out. ‘My dear Master Copperfield,’ she replied, ‘we went Plymouth.’ ‘To spot,’ I hinted. ‘Just so,’ said Mrs. Micawber. ‘To spot. But, truth is, talent wanted Custom House. The local influence family quite unavailing obtain employment department, man Mr. Micawber’s abilities. They would rather NOT man Mr. Micawber’s abilities. He would show deficiency others. Apart which,’ said Mrs. Micawber, ‘I disguise you, dear Master Copperfield, branch family settled Plymouth, became aware Mr. Micawber accompanied myself, little Wilkins his sister, twins, receive ardour he might expected, newly released captivity. In fact,’ said Mrs. Micawber, lowering her voice,--‘this ourselves--our reception cool.’ ‘Dear me!’ I said. ‘Yes,’ said Mrs. Micawber. ‘It truly painful contemplate mankind aspect, Master Copperfield, reception was, decidedly, cool. There doubt it. In fact, branch family settled Plymouth became quite personal Mr. Micawber, week.’ I said, thought, ought ashamed themselves. ‘Still, was,’ continued Mrs. Micawber. ‘Under circumstances, could man Mr. Micawber’s spirit do? But one obvious course left. To borrow, branch family, money return London, return sacrifice.’ ‘Then came back again, madam?’ I said. ‘We came back again,’ replied Mrs. Micawber. ‘Since then, I consulted branches family course expedient Mr. Micawber take--for I maintain he must take course, Master Copperfield,’ said Mrs. Micawber, argumentatively. ‘It clear family six, including domestic, cannot live upon air.’ ‘Certainly, madam,’ said I. ‘The opinion branches family,’ pursued Mrs. Micawber, ‘is, Mr. Micawber immediately turn his attention coals.’ ‘To what, madam?’ ‘To coals,’ said Mrs. Micawber. ‘To coal trade. Mr. Micawber induced think, inquiry, might opening man his talent Medway Coal Trade. Then, Mr. Micawber properly said, first step taken clearly was, come see Medway. Which came saw. I say “we”, Master Copperfield; I never will,’ said Mrs. Micawber emotion, ‘I never desert Mr. Micawber.’ I murmured admiration approbation. ‘We came,’ repeated Mrs. Micawber, ‘and saw Medway. My opinion coal trade river is, may require talent, certainly requires capital. Talent, Mr. Micawber has; capital, Mr. Micawber not. We saw, I think, greater part Medway; individual conclusion. Being near here, Mr. Micawber opinion would rash come on, see Cathedral. Firstly, account well worth seeing, never seen it; secondly, account great probability something turning cathedral town. We here,’ said Mrs. Micawber, ‘three days. Nothing has, yet, turned up; may surprise you, dear Master Copperfield, much would stranger, know present waiting remittance London, discharge pecuniary obligations hotel. Until arrival remittance,’ said Mrs. Micawber much feeling, ‘I cut home (I allude lodgings Pentonville), boy girl, twins.’ I felt utmost sympathy Mr. Mrs. Micawber anxious extremity, said much Mr. Micawber, returned: adding I wished I money enough, lend amount needed. Mr. Micawber’s answer expressed disturbance his mind. He said, shaking hands me, ‘Copperfield, true friend; worst comes worst, man without friend possessed shaving materials.’ At dreadful hint Mrs. Micawber threw her arms round Mr. Micawber’s neck entreated calm. He wept; far recovered, almost immediately, ring bell waiter, bespeak hot kidney pudding plate shrimps breakfast morning. When I took leave them, pressed much come dine went away, I could refuse. But, I knew I could come next day, I good deal prepare evening, Mr. Micawber arranged he would call Doctor Strong’s course morning (having presentiment remittance would arrive post), propose day after, would suit better. Accordingly I called school next forenoon, found Mr. Micawber parlour; called say dinner would take place proposed. When I asked remittance come, he pressed hand departed. As I looking window evening, surprised me, made rather uneasy, see Mr. Micawber Uriah Heep walk past, arm arm: Uriah humbly sensible honour done him, Mr. Micawber taking bland delight extending his patronage Uriah. But I still surprised, I went little hotel next day appointed dinner-hour, four of the clock, find, Mr. Micawber said, he gone home Uriah, drunk brandy-and-water Mrs. Heep’s. ‘And I will tell what, dear Copperfield,’ said Mr. Micawber, ‘your friend Heep young fellow might attorney-general. If I known young man, period difficulties came crisis, I say is, I believe creditors would great deal better managed were.’ I hardly understood could been, seeing Mr. Micawber paid nothing was; I like ask. Neither I like say, I hoped he communicative Uriah; inquire talked much me. I afraid hurting Mr. Micawber’s feelings, or, events, Mrs. Micawber’s, she sensitive; I uncomfortable it, too, often thought afterwards. We beautiful little dinner. Quite elegant dish fish; kidney-end loin veal, roasted; fried sausage-meat; partridge, pudding. There wine, strong ale; dinner Mrs. Micawber made us bowl hot punch her hands. Mr. Micawber uncommonly convivial. I never saw good company. He made his face shine punch, looked varnished over. He got cheerfully sentimental town, proposed success it; observing Mrs. Micawber made extremely snug comfortable he never forget agreeable hours passed Canterbury. He proposed afterwards; he, Mrs. Micawber, I, took review past acquaintance, course sold property again. Then I proposed Mrs. Micawber: or, least, said, modestly, ‘If you will allow me, Mrs. Micawber, I shall pleasure drinking health, madam.’ On Mr. Micawber delivered eulogium Mrs. Micawber’s character, said she ever his guide, philosopher, friend, he would recommend me, I came marrying time life, marry another woman, another woman could found. As punch disappeared, Mr. Micawber became still friendly convivial. Mrs. Micawber’s spirits becoming elevated, too, sang ‘Auld Lang Syne’. When came ‘Here is hand, trusty frere’, joined hands round table; declared would ‘take right gude Willie Waught’, had not least idea meant, really affected. In word, I never saw anybody thoroughly jovial Mr. Micawber was, last moment evening, I took hearty farewell his amiable wife. Consequently, I prepared, seven of the clock next morning, receive following communication, dated half past nine evening; quarter hour I left him:-- ‘My DEAR YOUNG FRIEND, ‘The die cast--all over. Hiding ravages care sickly mask mirth, I informed you, evening, hope remittance! Under circumstances, alike humiliating endure, humiliating contemplate, humiliating relate, I discharged pecuniary liability contracted establishment, giving note hand, made payable fourteen days date, residence, Pentonville, London. When becomes due, taken up. The result destruction. The bolt impending, tree must fall. ‘Let wretched man addresses you, dear Copperfield, beacon life. He writes intention, hope. If he could think much use, one gleam day might, possibility, penetrate cheerless dungeon his remaining existence--though his longevity is, present (to say least it), extremely problematical. ‘This last communication, dear Copperfield, ever receive ‘From ‘The ‘Beggared Outcast, ‘WILKINS MICAWBER.’ I shocked contents heart-rending letter, I ran directly towards little hotel intention taking way Doctor Strong’s, trying soothe Mr. Micawber word comfort. But, half-way there, I met London coach Mr. Mrs. Micawber behind; Mr. Micawber, picture tranquil enjoyment, smiling Mrs. Micawber’s conversation, eating walnuts paper bag, bottle sticking his breast pocket. As see me, I thought best, things considered, see them. So, great weight taken mind, I turned by-street nearest way school, felt, upon whole, relieved gone; though I still liked much, nevertheless. CHAPTER 18. A RETROSPECT My school-days! The silent gliding existence--the unseen, unfelt progress life--from childhood youth! Let think, I look back upon flowing water, dry channel overgrown leaves, whether marks along course, I remember ran. A moment, I occupy place Cathedral, went together, every Sunday morning, assembling first school purpose. The earthy smell, sunless air, sensation world shut out, resounding organ black white arched galleries aisles, wings take back, hold hovering days, half-sleeping half-waking dream. I last boy school. I risen months, several heads. But first boy seems mighty creature, dwelling afar off, whose giddy height unattainable. Agnes says ‘No,’ I say ‘Yes,’ tell her she little thinks stores knowledge mastered wonderful Being, whose place she thinks I, even I, weak aspirant, may arrive time. He private friend public patron, Steerforth was, I hold reverential respect. I chiefly wonder he will be, he leaves Doctor Strong’s, mankind maintain place him. But breaks upon me? This Miss Shepherd, I love. Miss Shepherd boarder Misses Nettingalls’ establishment. I adore Miss Shepherd. She little girl, spencer, round face curly flaxen hair. The Misses Nettingalls’ young ladies come Cathedral too. I cannot look upon book, I must look upon Miss Shepherd. When choristers chaunt, I hear Miss Shepherd. In service I mentally insert Miss Shepherd’s name--I put her among Royal Family. At home, room, I sometimes moved cry out, ‘Oh, Miss Shepherd!’ transport love. For time, I doubtful Miss Shepherd’s feelings, but, length, Fate propitious, meet dancing-school. I Miss Shepherd partner. I touch Miss Shepherd’s glove, feel thrill go right arm jacket, come hair. I say nothing Miss Shepherd, understand other. Miss Shepherd live united. Why I secretly give Miss Shepherd twelve Brazil nuts present, I wonder? They expressive affection, difficult pack parcel regular shape, hard crack, even room doors, oily cracked; yet I feel appropriate Miss Shepherd. Soft, seedy biscuits, also, I bestow upon Miss Shepherd; oranges innumerable. Once, I kiss Miss Shepherd cloak-room. Ecstasy! What agony indignation next day, I hear flying rumour Misses Nettingall stood Miss Shepherd stocks turning her toes! Miss Shepherd one pervading theme vision life, I ever come break her? I cannot conceive. And yet coolness grows Miss Shepherd myself. Whispers reach Miss Shepherd said she wished I would not stare so, avowed preference Master Jones--for Jones! boy merit whatever! The gulf Miss Shepherd widens. At last, one day, I meet Misses Nettingalls’ establishment walking. Miss Shepherd makes face she goes by, laughs her companion. All over. The devotion life--it seems life, same--is end; Miss Shepherd comes morning service, Royal Family know her more. I higher school, one breaks peace. I polite, now, Misses Nettingalls’ young ladies, should not dote them, twice many twenty times beautiful. I think dancing-school tiresome affair, wonder girls cannot dance leave us alone. I growing great Latin verses, neglect laces boots. Doctor Strong refers public promising young scholar. Mr. Dick wild joy, aunt remits guinea next post. The shade young butcher rises, like apparition armed head Macbeth. Who young butcher? He terror youth Canterbury. There vague belief abroad, beef suet he anoints his hair gives unnatural strength, he match man. He broad-faced, bull-necked, young butcher, rough red cheeks, ill-conditioned mind, injurious tongue. His main use tongue, is, disparage Doctor Strong’s young gentlemen. He says, publicly, want anything he will give ‘them. He names individuals among (myself included), he could undertake settle one hand, tied behind him. He waylays smaller boys punch unprotected heads, calls challenges open streets. For sufficient reasons I resolve fight butcher. It summer evening, green hollow, corner wall. I meet butcher appointment. I attended select body boys; butcher, two butchers, young publican, sweep. The preliminaries adjusted, butcher stand face face. In moment butcher lights ten thousand candles left eyebrow. In another moment, I do not know wall is, I am, anybody is. I hardly know butcher, always tangle tussle, knocking upon trodden grass. Sometimes I see butcher, bloody confident; sometimes I see nothing, sit gasping second’s knee; sometimes I go butcher madly, cut knuckles open his face, without appearing discompose all. At last I awake, queer head, giddy sleep, see butcher walking off, congratulated two butchers sweep publican, putting his coat he goes; I augur, justly, victory his. I taken home sad plight, I beef-steaks put eyes, rubbed vinegar brandy, find great puffy place bursting upper lip, swells immoderately. For three four days I remain home, ill-looking subject, green shade eyes; I dull, Agnes sister me, condoles me, reads me, makes time light happy. Agnes confidence completely, always; I tell her butcher, wrongs he heaped upon me; she thinks I could not done otherwise fight butcher, she shrinks trembles fought him. Time stolen unobserved, Adams head-boy days come now, he many many day. Adams left school long, he comes back, visit Doctor Strong, many there, besides myself, know him. Adams going called bar almost directly, advocate, wear wig. I surprised find meeker man I thought, less imposing appearance. He staggered world yet, either; goes (as well I make out) pretty much he never joined it. A blank, warriors poetry history march stately hosts seem end--and comes next! I head-boy, now! I look line boys me, condescending interest bring mind boy I myself, I first came there. That little fellow seems part me; I remember something left behind upon road life--as something I passed, rather actually been--and almost think someone else. And little girl I saw first day Mr. Wickfield’s, she? Gone also. In her stead, perfect likeness picture, child likeness more, moves house; Agnes--my sweet sister, I call her thoughts, counsellor friend, better angel lives come within her calm, good, self-denying influence--is quite woman. What changes come upon me, besides changes growth looks, knowledge I garnered while? I wear gold watch chain, ring upon little finger, long-tailed coat; I use great deal bear’s grease--which, taken conjunction ring, looks bad. Am I love again? I am. I worship eldest Miss Larkins. The eldest Miss Larkins little girl. She tall, dark, black-eyed, fine figure woman. The eldest Miss Larkins chicken; youngest Miss Larkins that, eldest must three four years older. Perhaps eldest Miss Larkins may thirty. My passion her beyond bounds. The eldest Miss Larkins knows officers. It awful thing bear. I see speaking her street. I see cross way meet her, her bonnet (she bright taste bonnets) seen coming pavement, accompanied her sister’s bonnet. She laughs talks, seems like it. I spend good deal spare time walking meet her. If I bow her day (I know her bow to, knowing Mr. Larkins), I happier. I deserve bow then. The raging agonies I suffer night Race Ball, I know eldest Miss Larkins dancing military, ought compensation, even-handed justice world. My passion takes away appetite, makes wear newest silk neckerchief continually. I relief putting best clothes, boots cleaned again. I seem, then, worthier eldest Miss Larkins. Everything belongs her, connected her, precious me. Mr. Larkins (a gruff old gentleman double chin, one his eyes immovable his head) fraught interest me. When I cannot meet his daughter, I go I likely meet him. To say ‘How do, Mr. Larkins? Are young ladies family quite well?’ seems pointed, I blush. I think continually age. Say I seventeen, say seventeen young eldest Miss Larkins, that? Besides, I shall one-and-twenty time almost. I regularly take walks outside Mr. Larkins’s house evening, though cuts heart see officers go in, hear drawing-room, eldest Miss Larkins plays harp. I even walk, two three occasions, sickly, spoony manner, round round house family gone bed, wondering eldest Miss Larkins’s chamber (and pitching, I dare say now, Mr. Larkins’s instead); wishing fire would burst out; assembled crowd would stand appalled; I, dashing ladder, might rear her window, save her arms, go back something she left behind, perish flames. For I generally disinterested love, think I could content make figure Miss Larkins, expire. Generally, always. Sometimes brighter visions rise me. When I dress (the occupation two hours), great ball given Larkins’s (the anticipation three weeks), I indulge fancy pleasing images. I picture taking courage make declaration Miss Larkins. I picture Miss Larkins sinking her head upon shoulder, saying, ‘Oh, Mr. Copperfield, I believe ears!’ I picture Mr. Larkins waiting next morning, saying, ‘My dear Copperfield, daughter told all. Youth objection. Here twenty thousand pounds. Be happy!’ I picture aunt relenting, blessing us; Mr. Dick Doctor Strong present marriage ceremony. I sensible fellow, I believe--I believe, looking back, I mean--and modest I sure; goes notwithstanding. I repair enchanted house, lights, chattering, music, flowers, officers (I sorry see), eldest Miss Larkins, blaze beauty. She dressed blue, blue flowers her hair--forget-me-nots--as SHE need wear forget-me-nots. It first really grown-up party I ever invited to, I little uncomfortable; I appear belong anybody, nobody appears anything say me, except Mr. Larkins, asks schoolfellows are, he need not do, I come insulted. But I stood doorway time, feasted eyes upon goddess heart, she approaches me--she, eldest Miss Larkins!--and asks pleasantly, I dance? I stammer, bow, ‘With you, Miss Larkins.’ ‘With one else?’ inquires Miss Larkins. ‘I pleasure dancing anyone else.’ Miss Larkins laughs blushes (or I think she blushes), says, ‘Next time one, I shall glad.’ The time arrives. ‘It waltz, I think,’ Miss Larkins doubtfully observes, I present myself. ‘Do waltz? If not, Captain Bailey--’ But I waltz (pretty well, too, happens), I take Miss Larkins out. I take her sternly side Captain Bailey. He wretched, I doubt; he nothing me. I wretched, too. I waltz eldest Miss Larkins! I do not know where, among whom, long. I know I swim space, blue angel, state blissful delirium, I find alone her little room, resting sofa. She admires flower (pink camellia japonica, price half-a-crown), button-hole. I give her, say: ‘I ask inestimable price it, Miss Larkins.’ ‘Indeed! What that?’ returns Miss Larkins. ‘A flower yours, I may treasure miser gold.’ ‘You are bold boy,’ says Miss Larkins. ‘There.’ She gives me, displeased; I put lips, breast. Miss Larkins, laughing, draws her hand arm, says, ‘Now take back Captain Bailey.’ I lost recollection delicious interview, waltz, she comes again, plain elderly gentleman playing whist night, upon her arm, says: ‘Oh! bold friend! Mr. Chestle wants know you, Mr. Copperfield.’ I feel he friend family, much gratified. ‘I admire taste, sir,’ says Mr. Chestle. ‘It credit. I suppose do not take much interest hops; I pretty large grower myself; ever like come neighbourhood--neighbourhood Ashford--and take run place,--we shall glad stop long like.’ I thank Mr. Chestle warmly, shake hands. I think I happy dream. I waltz eldest Miss Larkins again. She says I waltz well! I go home state unspeakable bliss, waltz imagination, night long, arm round blue waist dear divinity. For days afterwards, I lost rapturous reflections; I neither see her street, I call. I imperfectly consoled disappointment sacred pledge, perished flower. ‘Trotwood,’ says Agnes, one day dinner. ‘Who think going married tomorrow? Someone admire.’ ‘Not you, I suppose, Agnes?’ ‘Not me!’ raising her cheerful face music she copying. ‘Do hear him, Papa?--The eldest Miss Larkins.’ ‘To--to Captain Bailey?’ I enough power ask. ‘No; Captain. To Mr. Chestle, hop-grower.’ I terribly dejected week two. I take ring, I wear worst clothes, I use bear’s grease, I frequently lament late Miss Larkins’s faded flower. Being, time, rather tired kind life, received new provocation butcher, I throw flower away, go butcher, gloriously defeat him. This, resumption ring, well bear’s grease moderation, last marks I discern, now, progress seventeen. CHAPTER 19. I LOOK ABOUT ME, AND MAKE A DISCOVERY I doubtful whether I heart glad sorry, school-days drew end, time came leaving Doctor Strong’s. I happy there, I great attachment Doctor, I eminent distinguished little world. For reasons I sorry go; reasons, unsubstantial enough, I glad. Misty ideas young man disposal, importance attaching young man his disposal, wonderful things seen done magnificent animal, wonderful effects he could fail make upon society, lured away. So powerful visionary considerations boyish mind, I seem, according present way thinking, left school without natural regret. The separation made impression me, separations have. I try vain recall I felt it, circumstances were; momentous recollection. I suppose opening prospect confused me. I know juvenile experiences went little nothing then; life like great fairy story, I begin read, anything else. My aunt I held many grave deliberations calling I devoted. For year I endeavoured find satisfactory answer her often-repeated question, ‘What I would like be?’ But I particular liking, I could discover, anything. If I could inspired knowledge science navigation, taken command fast-sailing expedition, gone round world triumphant voyage discovery, I think I might considered completely suited. But, absence miraculous provision, desire apply pursuit would lie heavily upon her purse; duty it, whatever might be. Mr. Dick regularly assisted councils, meditative sage demeanour. He never made suggestion once; occasion (I do not know put his head), he suddenly proposed I ‘a Brazier’. My aunt received proposal ungraciously, he never ventured second; ever afterwards confined looking watchfully her her suggestions, rattling his money. ‘Trot, I tell what, dear,’ said aunt, one morning Christmas season I left school: ‘as knotty point still unsettled, must make mistake decision help it, I think better take little breathing-time. In meanwhile, must try look new point view, schoolboy.’ ‘I will, aunt.’ ‘It occurred me,’ pursued aunt, ‘that little change, glimpse life doors, may useful helping know mind, form cooler judgement. Suppose go old part country again, instance, see that--that out-of-the-way woman savagest names,’ said aunt, rubbing her nose, she could never thoroughly forgive Peggotty called. ‘Of things world, aunt, I like best!’ ‘Well,’ said aunt, ‘that is lucky, I like too. But it is natural rational like it. And I well persuaded whatever do, Trot, always natural rational.’ ‘I hope so, aunt.’ ‘Your sister, Betsey Trotwood,’ said aunt, ‘would natural rational girl ever breathed. You will worthy her, will not you?’ ‘I hope I shall worthy YOU, aunt. That enough me.’ ‘It is mercy poor dear baby mother did not live,’ said aunt, looking approvingly, ‘or she would vain her boy time, her soft little head would completely turned, anything left turn.’ (My aunt always excused weakness her behalf, transferring way poor mother.) ‘Bless me, Trotwood, remind her!’ ‘Pleasantly, I hope, aunt?’ said I. ‘He is like her, Dick,’ said aunt, emphatically, ‘he is like her, she afternoon she began fret--bless heart, he is like her, he look his two eyes!’ ‘Is he indeed?’ said Mr. Dick. ‘And he is like David, too,’ said aunt, decisively. ‘He like David!’ said Mr. Dick. ‘But I want be, Trot,’ resumed aunt, ‘--I do not mean physically, morally; well physically--is, firm fellow. A fine firm fellow, own. With resolution,’ said aunt, shaking her cap me, clenching her hand. ‘With determination. With character, Trot--with strength character influenced, except good reason, anybody, anything. That is I want be. That is father mother might been, Heaven knows, better it.’ I intimated I hoped I she described. ‘That may begin, small way, reliance upon yourself, act yourself,’ said aunt, ‘I shall send upon trip, alone. I think, once, Mr. Dick’s going you; but, second thoughts, I shall keep take care me.’ Mr. Dick, moment, looked little disappointed; honour dignity take care wonderful woman world, restored sunshine his face. ‘Besides,’ said aunt, ‘there is Memorial--’ ‘Oh, certainly,’ said Mr. Dick, hurry, ‘I intend, Trotwood, get done immediately--it really must done immediately! And go in, know--and then--’ said Mr. Dick, checking himself, pausing long time, ‘there will pretty kettle fish!’ In pursuance aunt’s kind scheme, I shortly afterwards fitted handsome purse money, portmanteau, tenderly dismissed upon expedition. At parting, aunt gave good advice, good many kisses; said her object I look me, think little, she would recommend stay days London, I liked it, either way Suffolk, coming back. In word, I liberty I would, three weeks month; conditions imposed upon freedom before-mentioned thinking looking me, pledge write three times week faithfully report myself. I went Canterbury first, I might take leave Agnes Mr. Wickfield (my old room whose house I yet relinquished), also good Doctor. Agnes glad see me, told house like since I left it. ‘I sure I like I away,’ said I. ‘I seem want right hand, I miss you. Though that is saying much; there is head right hand, heart. Everyone knows you, consults you, guided you, Agnes.’ ‘Everyone knows me, spoils me, I believe,’ she answered, smiling. ‘No. It is like one else. You good, sweet-tempered. You gentle nature, always right.’ ‘You talk,’ said Agnes, breaking pleasant laugh, she sat work, ‘as I late Miss Larkins.’ ‘Come! It is fair abuse confidence,’ I answered, reddening recollection blue enslaver. ‘But I shall confide you, same, Agnes. I never grow that. Whenever I fall trouble, fall love, I shall always tell you, you will let me--even I come fall love earnest.’ ‘Why, always earnest!’ said Agnes, laughing again. ‘Oh! child, schoolboy,’ said I, laughing turn, without little shame-faced. ‘Times altering now, I suppose I shall terrible state earnestness one day other. My wonder is, earnest yourself, time, Agnes.’ Agnes laughed again, shook her head. ‘Oh, I know not!’ said I, ‘because would told me. Or least’--for I saw faint blush her face, ‘you would let find myself. But one I know of, deserves love you, Agnes. Someone nobler character, worthy altogether anyone I ever seen here, must rise up, I give consent. In time come, I shall wary eye admirers; shall exact great deal successful one, I assure you.’ We gone on, far, mixture confidential jest earnest, long grown naturally familiar relations, begun mere children. But Agnes, suddenly lifting her eyes mine, speaking different manner, said: ‘Trotwood, something I want ask you, I may another opportunity asking long time, perhaps--something I would ask, I think, one else. Have observed gradual alteration Papa?’ I observed it, often wondered whether she too. I must shown much, now, face; her eyes moment cast down, I saw tears them. ‘Tell is,’ she said, low voice. ‘I think--shall I quite plain, Agnes, liking much?’ ‘Yes,’ she said. ‘I think he good habit increased upon since I first came here. He often nervous--or I fancy so.’ ‘It fancy,’ said Agnes, shaking her head. ‘His hand trembles, his speech plain, his eyes look wild. I remarked times, he least like himself, he certain wanted business.’ ‘By Uriah,’ said Agnes. ‘Yes; sense unfit it, understood it, shown his condition spite himself, seems make uneasy, next day he worse, next day worse, he becomes jaded haggard. Do alarmed I say, Agnes, state I saw him, evening, lay his head upon his desk, she would tears like child.’ Her hand passed softly lips I yet speaking, moment she met her father door room, hanging his shoulder. The expression her face, looked towards me, I felt touching. There deep fondness him, gratitude his love care, her beautiful look; fervent appeal deal tenderly him, even inmost thoughts, let harsh construction find place him; she was, once, proud devoted him, yet compassionate sorry, reliant upon so, too; nothing she could said would expressed me, moved more. We drink tea Doctor’s. We went usual hour; round study fireside found Doctor, his young wife, her mother. The Doctor, made much going away I going China, received honoured guest; called log wood thrown fire, he might see face his old pupil reddening blaze. ‘I shall see many new faces Trotwood’s stead, Wickfield,’ said Doctor, warming his hands; ‘I getting lazy, want ease. I shall relinquish young people another six months, lead quieter life.’ ‘You said so, time ten years, Doctor,’ Mr. Wickfield answered. ‘But I mean it,’ returned Doctor. ‘My first master succeed me--I earnest last--so you will soon arrange contracts, bind us firmly them, like couple knaves.’ ‘And take care,’ said Mr. Wickfield, ‘that you are imposed on, eh? As certainly would be, contract make yourself. Well! I ready. There worse tasks that, calling.’ ‘I shall nothing think then,’ said Doctor, smile, ‘but Dictionary; contract-bargain--Annie.’ As Mr. Wickfield glanced towards her, sitting tea table Agnes, she seemed avoid his look unwonted hesitation timidity, his attention became fixed upon her, something suggested his thoughts. ‘There post come India, I observe,’ he said, short silence. ‘By by! letters Mr. Jack Maldon!’ said Doctor. ‘Indeed!’ ‘Poor dear Jack!’ said Mrs. Markleham, shaking her head. ‘That trying climate!--like living, tell me, sand-heap, underneath burning-glass! He looked strong, he was not. My dear Doctor, his spirit, his constitution, he ventured boldly. Annie, dear, I sure must perfectly recollect cousin never strong--not called ROBUST, know,’ said Mrs. Markleham, emphasis, looking round upon us generally, ‘--from time daughter children together, walking about, arm-in-arm, livelong day.’ Annie, thus addressed, made reply. ‘Do I gather say, madam, Mr. Maldon ill?’ asked Mr. Wickfield. ‘Ill!’ replied Old Soldier. ‘My dear sir, he is sorts things.’ ‘Except well?’ said Mr. Wickfield. ‘Except well, indeed!’ said Old Soldier. ‘He dreadful strokes sun, doubt, jungle fevers agues, every kind thing mention. As his liver,’ said Old Soldier resignedly, ‘that, course, he gave altogether, he first went out!’ ‘Does he say this?’ asked Mr. Wickfield. ‘Say? My dear sir,’ returned Mrs. Markleham, shaking her head her fan, ‘you little know poor Jack Maldon ask question. Say? Not he. You might drag heels four wild horses first.’ ‘Mama!’ said Mrs. Strong. ‘Annie, dear,’ returned her mother, ‘once all, I must really beg interfere me, unless confirm I say. You know well I cousin Maldon would dragged heels number wild horses--why I confine four! I WILL NOT confine four--eight, sixteen, two-and-thirty, rather say anything calculated overturn Doctor’s plans.’ ‘Wickfield’s plans,’ said Doctor, stroking his face, looking penitently his adviser. ‘That say, joint plans him. I said myself, abroad home.’ ‘And I said’ added Mr. Wickfield gravely, ‘abroad. I means sending abroad. It is responsibility.’ ‘Oh! Responsibility!’ said Old Soldier. ‘Everything done best, dear Mr. Wickfield; everything done kindest best, know. But dear fellow cannot live there, he cannot live there. And he cannot live there, he will die there, sooner he will overturn Doctor’s plans. I know him,’ said Old Soldier, fanning herself, sort calm prophetic agony, ‘and I know he will die there, sooner he will overturn Doctor’s plans.’ ‘Well, well, madam,’ said Doctor cheerfully, ‘I bigoted plans, I overturn myself. I substitute plans. If Mr. Jack Maldon comes home account ill health, he must allowed go back, must endeavour make suitable fortunate provision country.’ Mrs. Markleham overcome generous speech--which, I need say, she expected led to--that she could tell Doctor like himself, go several times operation kissing sticks her fan, tapping his hand it. After she gently chid her daughter Annie, demonstrative kindnesses showered, her sake, her old playfellow; entertained us particulars concerning deserving members her family, desirable set deserving legs. All time, her daughter Annie never spoke, lifted her eyes. All time, Mr. Wickfield his glance upon her she sat his daughter’s side. It appeared he never thought observed anyone; intent upon her, upon his thoughts connexion her, quite absorbed. He asked Mr. Jack Maldon actually written reference himself, he written? ‘Why, here,’ said Mrs. Markleham, taking letter chimney-piece Doctor’s head, ‘the dear fellow says Doctor himself--where it? Oh!--“I sorry inform health suffering severely, I fear I may reduced necessity returning home time, hope restoration.” That is pretty plain, poor fellow! His hope restoration! But Annie’s letter plainer still. Annie, show letter again.’ ‘Not now, mama,’ she pleaded low tone. ‘My dear, absolutely are, subjects, one ridiculous persons world,’ returned her mother, ‘and perhaps unnatural claims family. We never heard letter all, I believe, unless I asked myself. Do call confidence, love, towards Doctor Strong? I surprised. You ought know better.’ The letter reluctantly produced; I handed old lady, I saw unwilling hand I took it, trembled. ‘Now let us see,’ said Mrs. Markleham, putting her glass her eye, ‘where passage is. “The remembrance old times, dearest Annie”--and forth--it is there. “The amiable old Proctor”--who is he? Dear me, Annie, illegibly cousin Maldon writes, stupid I am! “Doctor,” course. Ah! amiable indeed!’ Here she left off, kiss her fan again, shake Doctor, looking us state placid satisfaction. ‘Now I found it. “You may surprised hear, Annie,”--no, sure, knowing he never really strong; I say now?--“that I undergone much distant place, decided leave hazards; sick leave, I can; total resignation, obtained. What I endured, endure here, insupportable.” And promptitude best creatures,’ said Mrs. Markleham, telegraphing Doctor before, refolding letter, ‘it would insupportable think of.’ Mr. Wickfield said one word, though old lady looked his commentary intelligence; sat severely silent, his eyes fixed ground. Long subject dismissed, topics occupied us, he remained so; seldom raising his eyes, unless rest moment, thoughtful frown, upon Doctor, his wife, both. The Doctor fond music. Agnes sang great sweetness expression, Mrs. Strong. They sang together, played duets together, quite little concert. But I remarked two things: first, though Annie soon recovered her composure, quite herself, blank her Mr. Wickfield separated wholly other; secondly, Mr. Wickfield seemed dislike intimacy her Agnes, watch uneasiness. And now, I must confess, recollection I seen night Mr. Maldon went away, first began return upon meaning never had, trouble me. The innocent beauty her face innocent been; I mistrusted natural grace charm her manner; I looked Agnes her side, thought good true Agnes was, suspicions arose within ill-assorted friendship. She happy herself, however, happy too, made evening fly away hour. It closed incident I well remember. They taking leave other, Agnes going embrace her kiss her, Mr. Wickfield stepped them, accident, drew Agnes quickly away. Then I saw, though intervening time cancelled, I still standing doorway night departure, expression night face Mrs. Strong, confronted his. I cannot say impression made upon me, impossible I found it, I thought her afterwards, separate her look, remember her face innocent loveliness again. It haunted I got home. I seemed left Doctor’s roof dark cloud lowering it. The reverence I his grey head, mingled commiseration his faith treacherous him, resentment injured him. The impending shadow great affliction, great disgrace distinct form yet, fell like stain upon quiet place I worked played boy, cruel wrong. I pleasure thinking, more, grave old broad-leaved aloe-trees, remained shut hundred years together, trim smooth grass-plot, stone urns, Doctor’s walk, congenial sound Cathedral bell hovering all. It tranquil sanctuary boyhood sacked face, peace honour given winds. But morning brought parting old house, Agnes filled her influence; occupied mind sufficiently. I soon, doubt; I might sleep again--perhaps often--in old room; days inhabiting gone, old time past. I heavier heart I packed books clothes still remained sent Dover, I cared show Uriah Heep; officious help me, I uncharitably thought mighty glad I going. I got away Agnes her father, somehow, indifferent show manly, took seat upon box London coach. I softened forgiving, going town, I half mind nod old enemy butcher, throw five shillings drink. But he looked obdurate butcher he stood scraping great block shop, moreover, his appearance little improved loss front tooth I knocked out, I thought best make advances. The main object mind, I remember, got fairly road, appear old possible coachman, speak extremely gruff. The latter point I achieved great personal inconvenience; I stuck it, I felt grown-up sort thing. ‘You going through, sir?’ said coachman. ‘Yes, William,’ I said, condescendingly (I knew him); ‘I going London. I shall go Suffolk afterwards.’ ‘Shooting, sir?’ said coachman. He knew well I likely, time year, I going whaling; I felt complimented, too. ‘I do not know,’ I said, pretending undecided, ‘whether I shall take shot not.’ ‘Birds got wery shy, I am told,’ said William. ‘So I understand,’ said I. ‘Is Suffolk county, sir?’ asked William. ‘Yes,’ I said, importance. ‘Suffolk’s county.’ ‘I am told dumplings uncommon fine there,’ said William. I aware myself, I felt necessary uphold institutions county, evince familiarity them; I shook head, much say, ‘I believe you!’ ‘And Punches,’ said William. ‘There is cattle! A Suffolk Punch, he is good un, worth his weight gold. Did ever breed Suffolk Punches yourself, sir?’ ‘N-no,’ I said, ‘not exactly.’ ‘Here is gen’lm’n behind me, I will pound it,’ said William, ‘as bred ‘them wholesale.’ The gentleman spoken gentleman unpromising squint, prominent chin, tall white hat narrow flat brim, whose close-fitting drab trousers seemed button way outside his legs his boots his hips. His chin cocked coachman’s shoulder, near me, his breath quite tickled back head; I looked him, he leered leaders eye he did not squint, knowing manner. ‘Are not you?’ asked William. ‘Are not I what?’ said gentleman behind. ‘Bred Suffolk Punches wholesale?’ ‘I think so,’ said gentleman. ‘There are not sort orse I are not bred, sort dorg. Orses dorgs men’s fancy. They are wittles drink me--lodging, wife, children--reading, writing, Arithmetic--snuff, tobacker, sleep.’ ‘That are not sort man see sitting behind coach-box, though?’ said William ear, he handled reins. I construed remark indication wish he place, I blushingly offered resign it. ‘Well, do not mind, sir,’ said William, ‘I think would correct.’ I always considered first fall I life. When I booked place coach office I ‘Box Seat’ written entry, given book-keeper half-a-crown. I got special great-coat shawl, expressly honour distinguished eminence; glorified upon good deal; felt I credit coach. And here, first stage, I supplanted shabby man squint, merit smelling like livery-stables, able walk across me, like fly human being, horses canter! A distrust myself, often beset life small occasions, would better away, assuredly stopped growth little incident outside Canterbury coach. It vain take refuge gruffness speech. I spoke pit stomach rest journey, I felt completely extinguished, dreadfully young. It curious interesting, nevertheless, sitting behind four horses: well educated, well dressed, plenty money pocket; look places I slept weary journey. I abundant occupation thoughts, every conspicuous landmark road. When I looked trampers passed, saw well-remembered style face turned up, I felt tinker’s blackened hand bosom shirt again. When clattered narrow street Chatham, I caught glimpse, passing, lane old monster lived bought jacket, I stretched neck eagerly look place I sat, sun shade, waiting money. When came, last, within stage London, passed veritable Salem House Mr. Creakle laid heavy hand, I would given I had, lawful permission get thrash him, let boys like many caged sparrows. We went Golden Cross Charing Cross, mouldy sort establishment close neighbourhood. A waiter showed coffee-room; chambermaid introduced small bedchamber, smelt like hackney-coach, shut like family vault. I still painfully conscious youth, nobody stood awe all: chambermaid utterly indifferent opinions subject, waiter familiar me, offering advice inexperience. ‘Well now,’ said waiter, tone confidence, ‘what would like dinner? Young gentlemen likes poultry general: fowl!’ I told him, majestically I could, I was not humour fowl. ‘Are not you?’ said waiter. ‘Young gentlemen generally tired beef mutton: weal cutlet!’ I assented proposal, default able suggest anything else. ‘Do care taters?’ said waiter, insinuating smile, his head one side. ‘Young gentlemen generally overdosed taters.’ I commanded him, deepest voice, order veal cutlet potatoes, things fitting; inquire bar letters Trotwood Copperfield, Esquire--which I knew not, could not be, thought manly appear expect. He soon came back say none (at I much surprised) began lay cloth dinner box fire. While he engaged, he asked I would take it; replying ‘Half pint sherry,’ thought favourable opportunity, I afraid, extract measure wine stale leavings bottoms several small decanters. I opinion, because, I reading newspaper, I observed behind low wooden partition, his private apartment, busy pouring number vessels one, like chemist druggist making prescription. When wine came, too, I thought flat; certainly English crumbs it, expected foreign wine anything like pure state, I bashful enough drink it, say nothing. Being pleasant frame mind (from I infer poisoning always disagreeable stages process), I resolved go play. It Covent Garden Theatre I chose; there, back centre box, I saw Julius Caesar new Pantomime. To noble Romans alive me, walking entertainment, instead stern taskmasters school, novel delightful effect. But mingled reality mystery whole show, influence upon poetry, lights, music, company, smooth stupendous changes glittering brilliant scenery, dazzling, opened illimitable regions delight, I came rainy street, twelve of the clock night, I felt I come clouds, I leading romantic life ages, bawling, splashing, link-lighted, umbrella-struggling, hackney-coach-jostling, patten-clinking, muddy, miserable world. I emerged another door, stood street little while, I really stranger upon earth: unceremonious pushing hustling I received, soon recalled myself, put road back hotel; whither I went, revolving glorious vision way; where, porter oysters, I sat revolving still, past one of the clock, eyes coffee-room fire. I filled play, past--for was, manner, like shining transparency, I saw earlier life moving along--that I do not know figure handsome well-formed young man dressed tasteful easy negligence I reason remember well, became real presence me. But I recollect conscious his company without noticed his coming in--and still sitting, musing, coffee-room fire. At last I rose go bed, much relief sleepy waiter, got fidgets his legs, twisting them, hitting them, putting kinds contortions his small pantry. In going towards door, I passed person come in, saw plainly. I turned directly, came back, looked again. He know me, I knew moment. At another time I might wanted confidence decision speak him, might put next day, might lost him. But, condition mind, play still running high, his former protection appeared deserving gratitude, old love overflowed breast freshly spontaneously, I went once, fast-beating heart, said: ‘Steerforth! will not speak me?’ He looked me--just he used look, sometimes--but I saw recognition his face. ‘You do not remember me, I afraid,’ said I. ‘My God!’ he suddenly exclaimed. ‘It is little Copperfield!’ I grasped hands, could let go. But shame, fear might displease him, I could held round neck cried. ‘I never, never, never glad! My dear Steerforth, I overjoyed see you!’ ‘And I rejoiced see you, too!’ he said, shaking hands heartily. ‘Why, Copperfield, old boy, do not overpowered!’ And yet he glad, too, I thought, see delight I meeting affected me. I brushed away tears utmost resolution able keep back, I made clumsy laugh it, sat together, side side. ‘Why, come here?’ said Steerforth, clapping shoulder. ‘I came Canterbury coach, today. I adopted aunt part country, finished education there. How YOU come here, Steerforth?’ ‘Well, I call Oxford man,’ he returned; ‘that say, I get bored death there, periodically--and I way mother’s. You are devilish amiable-looking fellow, Copperfield. Just used be, I look you! Not altered least!’ ‘I knew immediately,’ I said; ‘but easily remembered.’ He laughed he ran his hand clustering curls his hair, said gaily: ‘Yes, I expedition duty. My mother lives little way town; roads beastly condition, house tedious enough, I remained tonight instead going on. I town half-a-dozen hours, I dozing grumbling away play.’ ‘I play, too,’ said I. ‘At Covent Garden. What delightful magnificent entertainment, Steerforth!’ Steerforth laughed heartily. ‘My dear young Davy,’ he said, clapping shoulder again, ‘you Daisy. The daisy field, sunrise, fresher are. I Covent Garden, too, never miserable business. Holloa, sir!’ This addressed waiter, attentive recognition, distance, came forward deferentially. ‘Where put friend, Mr. Copperfield?’ said Steerforth. ‘Beg pardon, sir?’ ‘Where he sleep? What is his number? You know I mean,’ said Steerforth. ‘Well, sir,’ said waiter, apologetic air. ‘Mr. Copperfield present forty-four, sir.’ ‘And devil mean,’ retorted Steerforth, ‘by putting Mr. Copperfield little loft stable?’ ‘Why, see was not aware, sir,’ returned waiter, still apologetically, ‘as Mr. Copperfield anyways particular. We give Mr. Copperfield seventy-two, sir, would preferred. Next you, sir.’ ‘Of course would preferred,’ said Steerforth. ‘And once.’ The waiter immediately withdrew make exchange. Steerforth, much amused put forty-four, laughed again, clapped shoulder again, invited breakfast next morning ten of the clock--an invitation I proud happy accept. It pretty late, took candles went upstairs, parted friendly heartiness his door, I found new room great improvement old one, musty, immense four-post bedstead it, quite little landed estate. Here, among pillows enough six, I soon fell asleep blissful condition, dreamed ancient Rome, Steerforth, friendship, early morning coaches, rumbling archway underneath, made dream thunder gods. CHAPTER 20. STEERFORTH’S HOME When chambermaid tapped door eight of the clock, informed shaving-water outside, I felt severely occasion it, blushed bed. The suspicion she laughed too, she said it, preyed upon mind time I dressing; gave me, I conscious, sneaking guilty air I passed her staircase, I going breakfast. I sensitively aware, indeed, younger I could wished, time I could make mind pass her all, ignoble circumstances case; but, hearing her broom, stood peeping window King Charles horseback, surrounded maze hackney-coaches, looking anything regal drizzling rain dark-brown fog, I admonished waiter gentleman waiting me. It coffee-room I found Steerforth expecting me, snug private apartment, red-curtained Turkey-carpeted, fire burnt bright, fine hot breakfast set forth table covered clean cloth; cheerful miniature room, fire, breakfast, Steerforth, all, shining little round mirror sideboard. I rather bashful first, Steerforth self-possessed, elegant, superior respects (age included); his easy patronage soon put rights, made quite home. I could enough admire change he wrought Golden Cross; compare dull forlorn state I held yesterday, morning’s comfort morning’s entertainment. As waiter’s familiarity, quenched never been. He attended us, I may say, sackcloth ashes. ‘Now, Copperfield,’ said Steerforth, alone, ‘I like hear doing, going, you. I feel property.’ Glowing pleasure find he still interest me, I told aunt proposed little expedition I me, whither tended. ‘As hurry, then,’ said Steerforth, ‘come home Highgate, stay day two. You pleased mother--she little vain prosy me, forgive her--and she pleased you.’ ‘I like sure that, kind enough say are,’ I answered, smiling. ‘Oh!’ said Steerforth, ‘everyone likes me, claim her sure acknowledged.’ ‘Then I think I shall favourite,’ said I. ‘Good!’ said Steerforth. ‘Come prove it. We go see lions hour two--it is something fresh fellow like show to, Copperfield--and we will journey Highgate coach.’ I could hardly believe I dream, I wake presently number forty-four, solitary box coffee-room familiar waiter again. After I written aunt told her fortunate meeting admired old schoolfellow, acceptance his invitation, went hackney-chariot, saw Panorama sights, took walk Museum, I could help observing much Steerforth knew, infinite variety subjects, little account he seemed make his knowledge. ‘You will take high degree college, Steerforth,’ said I, ‘if done already; good reason proud you.’ ‘I take degree!’ cried Steerforth. ‘Not I! dear Daisy--will mind calling Daisy?’ ‘Not all!’ said I. ‘That is good fellow! My dear Daisy,’ said Steerforth, laughing. ‘I least desire intention distinguish way. I done quite sufficient purpose. I find I heavy company enough I am.’ ‘But fame--’ I beginning. ‘You romantic Daisy!’ said Steerforth, laughing still heartily: ‘why I trouble myself, parcel heavy-headed fellows may gape hold hands? Let man. There is fame him, he is welcome it.’ I abashed made great mistake, glad change subject. Fortunately difficult do, Steerforth could always pass one subject another carelessness lightness his own. Lunch succeeded sight-seeing, short winter day wore away fast, dusk stage-coach stopped us old brick house Highgate summit hill. An elderly lady, though far advanced years, proud carriage handsome face, doorway alighted; greeting Steerforth ‘My dearest James,’ folded her arms. To lady he presented his mother, she gave stately welcome. It genteel old-fashioned house, quiet orderly. From windows room I saw London lying distance like great vapour, lights twinkling it. I time, dressing, glance solid furniture, framed pieces work (done, I supposed, Steerforth’s mother she girl), pictures crayons ladies powdered hair bodices, coming going walls, newly-kindled fire crackled sputtered, I called dinner. There second lady dining-room, slight short figure, dark, agreeable look at, appearance good looks too, attracted attention: perhaps I expected see her; perhaps I found sitting opposite her; perhaps something really remarkable her. She black hair eager black eyes, thin, scar upon her lip. It old scar--I rather call seam, discoloured, healed years ago--which cut her mouth, downward towards chin, barely visible across table, except her upper lip, shape altered. I concluded mind she thirty years age, she wished married. She little dilapidated--like house--with long let; yet had, I said, appearance good looks. Her thinness seemed effect wasting fire within her, found vent her gaunt eyes. She introduced Miss Dartle, Steerforth his mother called her Rosa. I found she lived there, long time Mrs. Steerforth’s companion. It appeared she never said anything she wanted say, outright; hinted it, made great deal practice. For example, Mrs. Steerforth observed, jest earnest, she feared her son led wild life college, Miss Dartle put thus: ‘Oh, really? You know ignorant I am, I ask information, is not always so? I thought kind life hands understood be--eh?’ ‘It education grave profession, mean that, Rosa,’ Mrs. Steerforth answered coldness. ‘Oh! Yes! That is true,’ returned Miss Dartle. ‘But is not it, though?--I want put right, I wrong--is not it, really?’ ‘Really what?’ said Mrs. Steerforth. ‘Oh! You mean it is not!’ returned Miss Dartle. ‘Well, I am glad hear it! Now, I know do! That is advantage asking. I shall never allow people talk wastefulness profligacy, forth, connexion life, more.’ ‘And right,’ said Mrs. Steerforth. ‘My son’s tutor conscientious gentleman; I implicit reliance son, I reliance him.’ ‘Should you?’ said Miss Dartle. ‘Dear me! Conscientious, he? Really conscientious, now?’ ‘Yes, I convinced it,’ said Mrs. Steerforth. ‘How nice!’ exclaimed Miss Dartle. ‘What comfort! Really conscientious? Then he is not--but course he cannot be, he is really conscientious. Well, I shall quite happy opinion him, time. You cannot think elevates opinion, know certain he is really conscientious!’ Her views every question, her correction everything said she opposed, Miss Dartle insinuated way: sometimes, I could conceal myself, great power, though contradiction even Steerforth. An instance happened dinner done. Mrs. Steerforth speaking intention going Suffolk, I said hazard glad I be, Steerforth would go me; explaining I going see old nurse, Mr. Peggotty’s family, I reminded boatman he seen school. ‘Oh! That bluff fellow!’ said Steerforth. ‘He son him, had not he?’ ‘No. That his nephew,’ I replied; ‘whom he adopted, though, son. He pretty little niece too, he adopted daughter. In short, his house--or rather his boat, he lives one, dry land--is full people objects his generosity kindness. You would delighted see household.’ ‘Should I?’ said Steerforth. ‘Well, I think I should. I must see done. It would worth journey (not mention pleasure journey you, Daisy), see sort people together, make one ‘them.’ My heart leaped new hope pleasure. But reference tone he spoken ‘that sort people’, Miss Dartle, whose sparkling eyes watchful us, broke again. ‘Oh, but, really? Do tell me. Are they, though?’ she said. ‘Are what? And what?’ said Steerforth. ‘That sort people.---Are really animals clods, beings another order? I want know SO much.’ ‘Why, there is pretty wide separation us,’ said Steerforth, indifference. ‘They expected sensitive are. Their delicacy shocked, hurt easily. They wonderfully virtuous, I dare say--some people contend that, least; I sure I do not want contradict them--but fine natures, may thankful that, like coarse rough skins, easily wounded.’ ‘Really!’ said Miss Dartle. ‘Well, I do not know, now, I better pleased hear that. It is consoling! It is delight know that, suffer, do not feel! Sometimes I quite uneasy sort people; I shall dismiss idea them, altogether. Live learn. I doubts, I confess, they are cleared up. I did not know, I know, shows advantage asking--do not it?’ I believed Steerforth said he had, jest, draw Miss Dartle out; I expected say much she gone, two sitting fire. But he merely asked I thought her. ‘She clever, she not?’ I asked. ‘Clever! She brings everything grindstone,’ said Steerforth, sharpens it, she sharpened her face figure years past. She worn herself away constant sharpening. She edge.’ ‘What remarkable scar upon her lip!’ I said. Steerforth’s face fell, he paused moment. ‘Why, fact is,’ he returned, ‘I that.’ ‘By unfortunate accident!’ ‘No. I young boy, she exasperated me, I threw hammer her. A promising young angel I must been!’ I deeply sorry touched painful theme, useless now. ‘She borne mark ever since, see,’ said Steerforth; ‘and she will bear her grave, she ever rests one--though I hardly believe she ever rest anywhere. She motherless child sort cousin father’s. He died one day. My mother, widow, brought her company her. She couple thousand pounds her own, saves interest every year, add principal. There is history Miss Rosa Dartle you.’ ‘And I doubt she loves like brother?’ said I. ‘Humph!’ retorted Steerforth, looking fire. ‘Some brothers loved much; love--but help yourself, Copperfield! We will drink daisies field, compliment you; lilies valley toil not, neither spin, compliment me--the shame me!’ A moody smile overspread his features cleared he said merrily, he his frank, winning self again. I could help glancing scar painful interest went tea. It long I observed susceptible part her face, that, she turned pale, mark altered first, became dull, lead-coloured streak, lengthening full extent, like mark invisible ink brought fire. There little altercation her Steerforth cast dice backgammon--when I thought her, one moment, storm rage; I saw start forth like old writing wall. It matter wonder find Mrs. Steerforth devoted her son. She seemed able speak think nothing else. She showed his picture infant, locket, his baby-hair it; she showed his picture he I first knew him; she wore her breast his picture he now. All letters he ever written her, she kept cabinet near her chair fire; she would read them, I glad hear too, he interposed, coaxed her design. ‘It Mr. Creakle’s, son tells me, first became acquainted,’ said Mrs. Steerforth, she I talking one table, played backgammon another. ‘Indeed, I recollect his speaking, time, pupil younger taken his fancy there; name, may suppose, lived memory.’ ‘He generous noble days, I assure you, madam,’ said I, ‘and I stood need friend. I quite crushed without him.’ ‘He always generous noble,’ said Mrs. Steerforth, proudly. I subscribed heart, God knows. She knew I did; stateliness her manner already abated towards me, except she spoke praise him, her air always lofty. ‘It fit school generally son,’ said she; ‘far it; particular circumstances considered time, importance even selection. My son’s high spirit made desirable he placed man felt superiority, would content bow it; found man there.’ I knew that, knowing fellow. And yet I despise it, thought redeeming quality he could allowed grace resisting one irresistible Steerforth. ‘My son’s great capacity tempted on, there, feeling voluntary emulation conscious pride,’ fond lady went say. ‘He would risen constraint; he found monarch place, he haughtily determined worthy his station. It like himself.’ I echoed, heart soul, like himself. ‘So son took, his will, compulsion, course he always, his pleasure, outstrip every competitor,’ she pursued. ‘My son informs me, Mr. Copperfield, quite devoted him, met yesterday made known tears joy. I affected woman I made pretence surprised son’s inspiring emotions; I cannot indifferent anyone sensible his merit, I glad see here, assure he feels unusual friendship you, may rely his protection.’ Miss Dartle played backgammon eagerly she everything else. If I seen her, first, board, I fancied her figure got thin, her eyes got large, pursuit, world. But I much mistaken she missed word this, lost look mine I received utmost pleasure, honoured Mrs. Steerforth’s confidence, felt older I done since I left Canterbury. When evening pretty far spent, tray glasses decanters came in, Steerforth promised, fire, he would seriously think going country me. There hurry, he said; week hence would do; his mother hospitably said same. While talking, he called Daisy; brought Miss Dartle again. ‘But really, Mr. Copperfield,’ she asked, ‘is nickname? And he give you? Is it--eh?--because he thinks young innocent? I stupid things.’ I coloured replying I believed was. ‘Oh!’ said Miss Dartle. ‘Now I glad know that! I ask information, I glad know it. He thinks young innocent; his friend. Well, that is quite delightful!’ She went bed soon this, Mrs. Steerforth retired too. Steerforth I, lingering half-an-hour fire, talking Traddles rest old Salem House, went upstairs together. Steerforth’s room next mine, I went look it. It picture comfort, full easy-chairs, cushions footstools, worked his mother’s hand, sort thing omitted could help render complete. Finally, her handsome features looked her darling portrait wall, even something her her likeness watch he slept. I found fire burning clear enough room time, curtains drawn windows round bed, giving snug appearance. I sat great chair upon hearth meditate happiness; enjoyed contemplation time, I found likeness Miss Dartle looking eagerly chimney-piece. It startling likeness, necessarily startling look. The painter had not made scar, I made it; was, coming going; confined upper lip I seen dinner, showing whole extent wound inflicted hammer, I seen she passionate. I wondered peevishly could not put her anywhere else instead quartering her me. To get rid her, I undressed quickly, extinguished light, went bed. But, I fell asleep, I could forget she still looking, ‘Is really, though? I want know’; I awoke night, I found I uneasily asking sorts people dreams whether really not--without knowing I meant. CHAPTER 21. LITTLE THEM’LY There servant house, man who, I understood, usually Steerforth, come his service University, appearance pattern respectability. I believe never existed his station respectable-looking man. He taciturn, soft-footed, quiet his manner, deferential, observant, always hand wanted, never near wanted; his great claim consideration his respectability. He pliant face, he rather stiff neck, rather tight smooth head short hair clinging sides, soft way speaking, peculiar habit whispering letter S distinctly, he seemed use oftener man; every peculiarity he he made respectable. If his nose upside-down, he would made respectable. He surrounded atmosphere respectability, walked secure it. It would next impossible suspect anything wrong, he thoroughly respectable. Nobody could thought putting livery, he highly respectable. To imposed derogatory work upon him, would inflict wanton insult feelings respectable man. And this, I noticed--the women-servants household intuitively conscious, always work themselves, generally he read paper pantry fire. Such self-contained man I never saw. But quality, every he possessed, he seemed respectable. Even fact one knew his Christian name, seemed form part his respectability. Nothing could objected his surname, Littimer, he known. Peter might hanged, Tom transported; Littimer perfectly respectable. It occasioned, I suppose, reverend nature respectability abstract, I felt particularly young man’s presence. How old he himself, I could guess--and went his credit score; calmness respectability he might numbered fifty years well thirty. Littimer room morning I up, bring reproachful shaving-water, put clothes. When I undrew curtains looked bed, I saw him, equable temperature respectability, unaffected east wind January, even breathing frostily, standing boots right left first dancing position, blowing specks dust coat he laid like baby. I gave good morning, asked of the clock was. He took his pocket respectable hunting-watch I ever saw, preventing spring his thumb opening far, looked face he consulting oracular oyster, shut again, said, I pleased, half past eight. ‘Mr. Steerforth glad hear rested, sir.’ ‘Thank you,’ said I, ‘very well indeed. Is Mr. Steerforth quite well?’ ‘Thank you, sir, Mr. Steerforth tolerably well.’ Another his characteristics--no use superlatives. A cool calm medium always. ‘Is anything I honour you, sir? The warning-bell ring nine; family take breakfast half past nine.’ ‘Nothing, I thank you.’ ‘I thank YOU, sir, please’; that, little inclination his head he passed bed-side, apology correcting me, he went out, shutting door delicately I fallen sweet sleep life depended. Every morning held exactly conversation: never more, never less: yet, invariably, however far I might lifted over-night, advanced towards maturer years, Steerforth’s companionship, Mrs. Steerforth’s confidence, Miss Dartle’s conversation, presence respectable man I became, smaller poets sing, ‘a boy again’. He got horses us; Steerforth, knew everything, gave lessons riding. He provided foils us, Steerforth gave lessons fencing--gloves, I began, master, improve boxing. It gave manner concern Steerforth find novice sciences, I never could bear show want skill respectable Littimer. I reason believe Littimer understood arts himself; he never led suppose anything kind, much vibration one his respectable eyelashes; yet whenever he by, practising, I felt greenest inexperienced mortals. I particular man, he made particular effect time, took place thereafter. The week passed away delightful manner. It passed rapidly, may supposed, one entranced I was; yet gave many occasions knowing Steerforth better, admiring thousand respects, close I seemed much longer time. A dashing way he treating like plaything, agreeable behaviour he could adopted. It reminded old acquaintance; seemed natural sequel it; showed he unchanged; relieved uneasiness I might felt, comparing merits his, measuring claims upon his friendship equal standard; all, familiar, unrestrained, affectionate demeanour he used towards one else. As he treated school differently rest, I joyfully believed he treated life unlike friend he had. I believed I nearer his heart friend, heart warmed attachment him. He made his mind go country, day arrived departure. He doubtful first whether take Littimer not, decided leave home. The respectable creature, satisfied his lot whatever was, arranged portmanteaux little carriage take us London, intended defy shocks ages, received modestly proffered donation perfect tranquillity. We bade adieu Mrs. Steerforth Miss Dartle, many thanks part, much kindness devoted mother’s. The last thing I saw Littimer’s unruffled eye; fraught, I fancied, silent conviction I young indeed. What I felt, returning auspiciously old familiar places, I shall endeavour describe. We went Mail. I concerned, I recollect, even honour Yarmouth, Steerforth said, drove dark streets inn, that, well he could make out, good, queer, out-of-the-way kind hole, I highly pleased. We went bed arrival (I observed pair dirty shoes gaiters connexion old friend Dolphin passed door), breakfasted late morning. Steerforth, great spirits, strolling beach I up, made acquaintance, he said, half boatmen place. Moreover, he seen, distance, he sure must identical house Mr. Peggotty, smoke coming chimney; great mind, he told me, walk swear he grown knowledge. ‘When propose introduce there, Daisy?’ he said. ‘I disposal. Make arrangements.’ ‘Why, I thinking evening would good time, Steerforth, sitting round fire. I like see it is snug, it is curious place.’ ‘So it!’ returned Steerforth. ‘This evening.’ ‘I shall give notice here, know,’ said I, delighted. ‘We must take surprise.’ ‘Oh, course! It is fun,’ said Steerforth, ‘unless take surprise. Let us see natives aboriginal condition.’ ‘Though ARE sort people mentioned,’ I returned. ‘Aha! What! recollect skirmishes Rosa, you?’ he exclaimed quick look. ‘Confound girl, I half afraid her. She is like goblin me. But never mind her. Now going do? You going see nurse, I suppose?’ ‘Why, yes,’ I said, ‘I must see Peggotty first all.’ ‘Well,’ replied Steerforth, looking his watch. ‘Suppose I deliver cried couple hours. Is long enough?’ I answered, laughing, I thought might get time, he must come also; he would find his renown preceded him, he almost great personage I was. ‘I will come anywhere like,’ said Steerforth, ‘or anything like. Tell come to; two hours I will produce state please, sentimental comical.’ I gave minute directions finding residence Mr. Barkis, carrier Blunderstone elsewhere; and, understanding, went alone. There sharp bracing air; ground dry; sea crisp clear; sun diffusing abundance light, much warmth; everything fresh lively. I fresh lively myself, pleasure there, I could stopped people streets shaken hands them. The streets looked small, course. The streets seen children always do, I believe, go back them. But I forgotten nothing them, found nothing changed, I came Mr. Omer’s shop. OMER AND Joram written up, OMER used be; inscription, DRAPER, TAILOR, HABERDASHER, FUNERAL FURNISHER, &c., remained was. My footsteps seemed tend naturally shop door, I read words way, I went across road looked in. There pretty woman back shop, dancing little child her arms, another little fellow clung her apron. I difficulty recognizing either Minnie Minnie’s children. The glass door parlour open; workshop across yard I could faintly hear old tune playing, never left off. ‘Is Mr. Omer home?’ said I, entering. ‘I like see him, moment, he is.’ ‘Oh yes, sir, he home,’ said Minnie; ‘the weather do not suit his asthma doors. Joe, call grandfather!’ The little fellow, holding her apron, gave lusty shout, sound made bashful, he buried his face her skirts, her great admiration. I heard heavy puffing blowing coming towards us, soon Mr. Omer, shorter-winded yore, much older-looking, stood me. ‘Servant, sir,’ said Mr. Omer. ‘What I you, sir?’ ‘You shake hands me, Mr. Omer, please,’ said I, putting own. ‘You good-natured once, I afraid I did not show I thought so.’ ‘Was I though?’ returned old man. ‘I am glad hear it, I do not remember when. Are sure me?’ ‘Quite.’ ‘I think memory got short breath,’ said Mr. Omer, looking shaking his head; ‘for I do not remember you.’ ‘Do not remember coming coach meet me, breakfast here, riding Blunderstone together: you, I, Mrs. Joram, Mr. Joram too--who was not her husband then?’ ‘Why, Lord bless soul!’ exclaimed Mr. Omer, thrown his surprise fit coughing, ‘you do not say so! Minnie, dear, recollect? Dear me, yes; party lady, I think?’ ‘My mother,’ I rejoined. ‘To--be--sure,’ said Mr. Omer, touching waistcoat his forefinger, ‘and little child too! There two parties. The little party laid along party. Over Blunderstone was, course. Dear me! And since?’ Very well, I thanked him, I hoped he too. ‘Oh! nothing grumble at, know,’ said Mr. Omer. ‘I find breath gets short, seldom gets longer man gets older. I take comes, make it. That is best way, are not it?’ Mr. Omer coughed again, consequence laughing, assisted his fit his daughter, stood close beside us, dancing her smallest child counter. ‘Dear me!’ said Mr. Omer. ‘Yes, sure. Two parties! Why, ride, you will believe me, day named Minnie marry Joram. “Do name it, sir,” says Joram. “Yes, do, father,” says Minnie. And he is come business. And look here! The youngest!’ Minnie laughed, stroked her banded hair upon her temples, her father put one his fat fingers hand child she dancing counter. ‘Two parties, course!’ said Mr. Omer, nodding his head retrospectively. ‘Ex-actly so! And Joram’s work, minute, grey one silver nails, measurement’--the measurement dancing child upon counter--‘by good two inches.---Will take something?’ I thanked him, declined. ‘Let see,’ said Mr. Omer. ‘Barkis’s carrier’s wife--Peggotty’s boatman’s sister--she something family? She service there, sure?’ My answering affirmative gave great satisfaction. ‘I believe breath get long next, memory’s getting much so,’ said Mr. Omer. ‘Well, sir, we have got young relation here, articles us, elegant taste dress-making business--I assure I do not believe there is Duchess England touch her.’ ‘Not little Them’ly?’ said I, involuntarily. ‘Them’ly’s her name,’ said Mr. Omer, ‘and she is little too. But you will believe me, she face her half women town mad her.’ ‘Nonsense, father!’ cried Minnie. ‘My dear,’ said Mr. Omer, ‘I do not say it is case you,’ winking me, ‘but I say half women Yarmouth--ah! five mile round--are mad girl.’ ‘Then she kept her station life, father,’ said Minnie, ‘and given hold talk her, could not done it.’ ‘Could not done it, dear!’ retorted Mr. Omer. ‘Could not done it! Is YOUR knowledge life? What woman could not do, she should not do--especially subject another woman’s good looks?’ I really thought Mr. Omer, he uttered libellous pleasantry. He coughed extent, his breath eluded his attempts recover obstinacy, I fully expected see his head go behind counter, his little black breeches, rusty little bunches ribbons knees, come quivering last ineffectual struggle. At length, however, he got better, though he still panted hard, exhausted he obliged sit stool shop-desk. ‘You see,’ he said, wiping his head, breathing difficulty, ‘she has not taken much companions here; she has not taken kindly particular acquaintances friends, mention sweethearts. In consequence, ill-natured story got about, Them’ly wanted lady. Now opinion is, came circulation principally account her sometimes saying, school, she lady she would like so-and-so her uncle--do not see?--and buy such-and-such fine things.’ ‘I assure you, Mr. Omer, she said me,’ I returned eagerly, ‘when children.’ Mr. Omer nodded his head rubbed his chin. ‘Just so. Then little, she could dress herself, see, better others could deal, made things unpleasant. Moreover, she rather might called wayward--I will go far say I call wayward myself,’ said Mr. Omer; ‘--did not know her mind quite--a little spoiled--and could not, first, exactly bind herself down. No ever said her, Minnie?’ ‘No, father,’ said Mrs. Joram. ‘That is worst, I believe.’ ‘So she got situation,’ said Mr. Omer, ‘to keep fractious old lady company, did not well agree, she did not stop. At last she came here, apprenticed three years. Nearly two ‘them over, she good girl ever was. Worth six! Minnie, she worth six, now?’ ‘Yes, father,’ replied Minnie. ‘Never say I detracted her!’ ‘Very good,’ said Mr. Omer. ‘That is right. And so, young gentleman,’ he added, moments’ rubbing his chin, ‘that may consider long-winded well short-breathed, I believe that is it.’ As spoken subdued tone, speaking Them’ly, I doubt she near. On asking now, so, Mr. Omer nodded yes, nodded towards door parlour. My hurried inquiry I might peep in, answered free permission; and, looking glass, I saw her sitting her work. I saw her, beautiful little creature, cloudless blue eyes, looked childish heart, turned laughingly upon another child Minnie’s playing near her; enough wilfulness her bright face justify I heard; much old capricious coyness lurking it; nothing her pretty looks, I sure, meant goodness happiness, good happy course. The tune across yard seemed never left off--alas! tune never DOES leave off--was beating, softly, while. ‘Would not like step in,’ said Mr. Omer, ‘and speak her? Walk speak her, sir! Make home!’ I bashful then--I afraid confusing her, I less afraid confusing myself.--but I informed hour she left evening, order visit might timed accordingly; taking leave Mr. Omer, his pretty daughter, her little children, went away dear old Peggotty’s. Here she was, tiled kitchen, cooking dinner! The moment I knocked door she opened it, asked I pleased want. I looked her smile, she gave smile return. I never ceased write her, must seven years since met. ‘Is Mr. Barkis home, madam?’ I said, feigning speak roughly her. ‘He is home, sir,’ returned Peggotty, ‘but he is bad abed rheumatics.’ ‘Do not he go Blunderstone now?’ I asked. ‘When he is well he do,’ she answered. ‘Do YOU ever go there, Mrs. Barkis?’ She looked attentively, I noticed quick movement her hands towards other. ‘Because I want ask question house there, call the--what it?--the Rookery,’ said I. She took step backward, put her hands undecided frightened way, keep off. ‘Peggotty!’ I cried her. She cried, ‘My darling boy!’ burst tears, locked one another’s arms. What extravagances she committed; laughing crying me; pride she showed, joy, sorrow she whose pride joy I might been, could never hold fond embrace; I heart tell. I troubled misgiving young respond her emotions. I never laughed cried life, I dare say--not even her--more freely I morning. ‘Barkis glad,’ said Peggotty, wiping her eyes her apron, ‘that it will good pints liniment. May I go tell here? Will come see him, dear?’ Of course I would. But Peggotty could get room easily she meant to, often she got door looked round me, she came back another laugh another cry upon shoulder. At last, make matter easier, I went upstairs her; waited outside minute, she said word preparation Mr. Barkis, presented invalid. He received absolute enthusiasm. He rheumatic shaken hands with, he begged shake tassel top his nightcap, I cordially. When I sat side bed, he said world good feel he driving Blunderstone road again. As he lay bed, face upward, covered, exception, he seemed nothing face--like conventional cherubim--he looked queerest object I ever beheld. ‘What name it, I wrote cart, sir?’ said Mr. Barkis, slow rheumatic smile. ‘Ah! Mr. Barkis, grave talks matter, had not we?’ ‘I willin’ long time, sir?’ said Mr. Barkis. ‘A long time,’ said I. ‘And I do not regret it,’ said Mr. Barkis. ‘Do remember told once, her making apple parsties cooking?’ ‘Yes, well,’ I returned. ‘It true,’ said Mr. Barkis, ‘as turnips is. It true,’ said Mr. Barkis, nodding his nightcap, his means emphasis, ‘as taxes is. And nothing’s truer them.’ Mr. Barkis turned his eyes upon me, assent result his reflections bed; I gave it. ‘Nothing’s truer them,’ repeated Mr. Barkis; ‘a man poor I am, finds his mind he is laid up. I am poor man, sir!’ ‘I sorry hear it, Mr. Barkis.’ ‘A poor man, indeed I am,’ said Mr. Barkis. Here his right hand came slowly feebly bedclothes, purposeless uncertain grasp took hold stick loosely tied side bed. After poking instrument, course his face assumed variety distracted expressions, Mr. Barkis poked box, end visible time. Then his face became composed. ‘Old clothes,’ said Mr. Barkis. ‘Oh!’ said I. ‘I wish Money, sir,’ said Mr. Barkis. ‘I wish was, indeed,’ said I. ‘But ARE NOT,’ said Mr. Barkis, opening his eyes wide he possibly could. I expressed quite sure that, Mr. Barkis, turning his eyes gently his wife, said: ‘She is usefullest best women, C. P. Barkis. All praise anyone give C. P. Barkis, she deserves, more! My dear, you will get dinner today, company; something good eat drink, you?’ I protested unnecessary demonstration honour, I saw Peggotty, opposite side bed, extremely anxious I not. So I held peace. ‘I got trifle money somewhere me, dear,’ said Mr. Barkis, ‘but I am little tired. If Mr. David leave short nap, I will try find I wake.’ We left room, compliance request. When got outside door, Peggotty informed Mr. Barkis, ‘a little nearer’ he used be, always resorted device producing single coin his store; he endured unheard-of agonies crawling bed alone, taking unlucky box. In effect, presently heard uttering suppressed groans dismal nature, magpie proceeding racked every joint; Peggotty’s eyes full compassion him, she said his generous impulse would good, better check it. So he groaned on, he got bed again, suffering, I doubt, martyrdom; called us in, pretending woke refreshing sleep, produce guinea his pillow. His satisfaction happy imposition us, preserved impenetrable secret box, appeared sufficient compensation his tortures. I prepared Peggotty Steerforth’s arrival long he came. I persuaded she knew difference his personal benefactor hers, kind friend me, she would received utmost gratitude devotion case. But his easy, spirited good humour; his genial manner, his handsome looks, his natural gift adapting whomsoever he pleased, making direct, he cared it, main point interest anybody’s heart; bound her wholly five minutes. His manner me, alone, would her. But, causes combined, I sincerely believe she kind adoration he left house night. He stayed dinner--if I say willingly, I half express readily gaily. He went Mr. Barkis’s room like light air, brightening refreshing he healthy weather. There noise, effort, consciousness, anything he did; everything indescribable lightness, seeming impossibility anything else, anything better, graceful, natural, agreeable, overcomes me, even now, remembrance. We made merry little parlour, Book Martyrs, unthumbed since time, laid upon desk old, I turned terrific pictures, remembering old sensations awakened, feeling them. When Peggotty spoke she called room, ready night, her hoping I would occupy it, I could much look Steerforth, hesitating, he possessed whole case. ‘Of course,’ he said. ‘You will sleep here, stay, I shall sleep hotel.’ ‘But bring far,’ I returned, ‘and separate, seems bad companionship, Steerforth.’ ‘Why, name Heaven, naturally belong?’ he said. ‘What “seems”, compared that?’ It settled once. He maintained his delightful qualities last, started forth, eight of the clock, Mr. Peggotty’s boat. Indeed, brightly exhibited hours went on; I thought even then, I doubt now, consciousness success his determination please, inspired new delicacy perception, made it, subtle was, easy him. If anyone told me, then, brilliant game, played excitement moment, employment high spirits, thoughtless love superiority, mere wasteful careless course winning worthless him, next minute thrown away--I say, anyone told lie night, I wonder manner receiving indignation would found vent! Probably increase, possible, romantic feelings fidelity friendship I walked beside him, dark wintry sands towards old boat; wind sighing around us even mournfully, sighed moaned upon night I first darkened Mr. Peggotty’s door. ‘This wild kind place, Steerforth, not?’ ‘Dismal enough dark,’ he said: ‘and sea roars hungry us. Is boat, I see light yonder?’ ‘That is boat,’ said I. ‘And it is I saw morning,’ he returned. ‘I came straight it, instinct, I suppose.’ We said approached light, made softly door. I laid hand upon latch; whispering Steerforth keep close me, went in. A murmur voices audible outside, and, moment entrance, clapping hands: latter noise, I surprised see, proceeded generally disconsolate Mrs. Gummidge. But Mrs. Gummidge person unusually excited. Mr. Peggotty, his face lighted uncommon satisfaction, laughing his might, held his rough arms wide open, little Them’ly run them; Ham, mixed expression his face admiration, exultation, lumbering sort bashfulness sat upon well, held little Them’ly hand, he presenting her Mr. Peggotty; little Them’ly herself, blushing shy, delighted Mr. Peggotty’s delight, her joyous eyes expressed, stopped entrance (for she saw us first) act springing Ham nestle Mr. Peggotty’s embrace. In first glimpse all, moment passing dark cold night warm light room, way employed: Mrs. Gummidge background, clapping her hands like madwoman. The little picture instantaneously dissolved going in, one might doubted whether ever been. I midst astonished family, face face Mr. Peggotty, holding hand him, Ham shouted: ‘Mas’r Davy! It is Mas’r Davy!’ In moment shaking hands one another, asking one another did, telling one another glad meet, talking once. Mr. Peggotty proud overjoyed see us, he know say do, kept shaking hands me, Steerforth, me, ruffling his shaggy hair his head, laughing glee triumph, treat see him. ‘Why, two gent’lmen--gent’lmen growed--should come roof tonight, nights life,’ said Mr. Peggotty, ‘is thing never happened afore, I rightly believe! Them’ly, darling, come here! Come here, little witch! There is Mas’r Davy’s friend, dear! There is gent’lman you have heerd on, Them’ly. He comes see you, along Mas’r Davy, brightest night uncle’s life ever be, Gorm t’other one, horroar it!’ After delivering speech breath, extraordinary animation pleasure, Mr. Peggotty put one his large hands rapturously side his niece’s face, kissing dozen times, laid gentle pride love upon his broad chest, patted his hand lady’s. Then he let her go; she ran little chamber I used sleep, looked round upon us, quite hot breath his uncommon satisfaction. ‘If two gent’lmen--gent’lmen growed now, gent’lmen--’ said Mr. Peggotty. ‘So th’ are, th’ are!’ cried Ham. ‘Well said! So th’ are. Mas’r Davy bor’--gent’lmen growed--so th’ are!’ ‘If two gent’lmen, gent’lmen growed,’ said Mr. Peggotty, ‘do not ex-cuse state mind, understand matters, I will arks pardon. Them’ly, dear!--She knows I am going tell,’ his delight broke again, ‘and made off. Would good look arter her, Mawther, minute?’ Mrs. Gummidge nodded disappeared. ‘If are not,’ said Mr. Peggotty, sitting among us fire, ‘the brightest night life, I am shellfish--biled too--and I cannot say. This little Them’ly, sir,’ low voice Steerforth, ‘--her see blushing now--’ Steerforth nodded; pleased expression interest, participation Mr. Peggotty’s feelings, latter answered he spoken. ‘To sure,’ said Mr. Peggotty. ‘That is her, she is. Thankee, sir.’ Ham nodded several times, he would said too. ‘This little Them’ly ours,’ said Mr. Peggotty, ‘has been, house, I suppose (I am ignorant man, that is belief) one little bright-eyed creetur house. She are not child; I never one; I could not love her more. You understand! I could not it!’ ‘I quite understand,’ said Steerforth. ‘I know do, sir,’ returned Mr. Peggotty, ‘and thankee again. Mas’r Davy, he remember she was; may judge self she is; neither cannot fully know she been, is, be, loving art. I rough, sir,’ said Mr. Peggotty, ‘I rough Sea Porkypine; one, unless, mayhap, woman, know, I think, little Them’ly me. And betwixt ourselves,’ sinking his voice lower yet, ‘that woman’s name are not Missis Gummidge neither, though she world merits.’ Mr. Peggotty ruffled his hair again, hands, preparation he going say, went on, hand upon his knees: ‘There certain person know’d Them’ly, time her father drownded; seen her constant; babby, young gal, woman. Not much person look at, he warn’t,’ said Mr. Peggotty, ‘something build--rough--a good deal sou’-wester him--wery salt--but, whole, honest sort chap, his art right place.’ I thought I never seen Ham grin anything like extent he sat grinning us now. ‘What blessed tarpaulin go do,’ said Mr. Peggotty, his face one high noon enjoyment, ‘but he loses art his little Them’ly. He follers her about, he makes hisself sort servant her, he loses great measure his relish his wittles, long-run he makes clear wot’s amiss. Now I could wish myself, see, little Them’ly fair way married. I could wish see her, ewents, articles honest man right defend her. I do not know long I may live, soon I may die; I know I capsized, night, gale wind Yarmouth Roads here, see town-lights shining last time rollers I could not make head against, I could go quieter thinking “There is man ashore there, iron-true little Them’ly, God bless her, wrong touch Them’ly man lives.”’ Mr. Peggotty, simple earnestness, waved his right arm, he waving town-lights last time, then, exchanging nod Ham, whose eye he caught, proceeded before. ‘Well! I counsels speak Them’ly. He is big enough, he is bashfuller little un, he do not like. So I speak. “What! Him!” says Them’ly. “Him I have know’d intimate many years, like much. Oh, Uncle! I never him. He is good fellow!” I gives her kiss, I says her than, “My dear, you are right speak out, you are choose yourself, you are free little bird.” Then I aways him, I says, “I wish could so, cannot. But was, wot I say is, Be her, like man.” He says me, a-shaking hand, “I will!” he says. And he was--honourable manful--for two year going on, home afore.’ Mr. Peggotty’s face, varied expression various stages his narrative, resumed former triumphant delight, he laid hand upon knee hand upon Steerforth’s (previously wetting both, greater emphasis action), divided following speech us: ‘All sudden, one evening--as might tonight--comes little Them’ly her work, her! There are not much that, you will say. No, he takes care her, like brother, arter dark, indeed afore dark, times. But tarpaulin chap, he takes hold her hand, he cries me, joyful, “Look here! This little wife!” And she says, half bold half shy, half laughing half crying, “Yes, Uncle! If please.”--If I please!’ cried Mr. Peggotty, rolling his head ecstasy idea; ‘Lord, I anythink else!--“If please, I steadier now, I thought better it, I will good little wife I him, he is dear, good fellow!” Then Missis Gummidge, she claps her hands like play, come in. Theer! murder’s out!’ said Mr. Peggotty--‘You come in! It took place present hour; here is man that will marry her, minute she is her time.’ Ham staggered, well he might, blow Mr. Peggotty dealt his unbounded joy, mark confidence friendship; feeling called upon say something us, he said, much faltering great difficulty: ‘She warn’t higher was, Mas’r Davy--when first come--when I thought she would grow be. I see her grown up--gent’lmen--like flower. I would lay life her--Mas’r Davy--Oh! content cheerful! She is me--gent’lmen--than--she is ever I want, ever I--than ever I could say. I--I love her true. There are not gent’lman land--nor yet sailing upon sea--that love his lady I love her, though there is many common man--would say better--what he meant.’ I thought affecting see sturdy fellow Ham now, trembling strength he felt pretty little creature his heart. I thought simple confidence reposed us Mr. Peggotty himself, was, itself, affecting. I affected story altogether. How far emotions influenced recollections childhood, I do not know. Whether I come lingering fancy I still love little Them’ly, I do not know. I know I filled pleasure this; but, first, indescribably sensitive pleasure, little would changed pain. Therefore, depended upon touch prevailing chord among skill, I made poor hand it. But depended upon Steerforth; he address, minutes easy happy possible be. ‘Mr. Peggotty,’ he said, ‘you thoroughly good fellow, deserve happy tonight. My hand upon it! Ham, I give joy, boy. My hand upon that, too! Daisy, stir fire, make brisk one! Mr. Peggotty, unless induce gentle niece come back (for I vacate seat corner), I shall go. Any gap fireside night--such gap least all--I would not make, wealth Indies!’ So Mr. Peggotty went old room fetch little Them’ly. At first little Them’ly did not like come, Ham went. Presently brought her fireside, much confused, shy,--but she soon became assured she found gently respectfully Steerforth spoke her; skilfully he avoided anything would embarrass her; he talked Mr. Peggotty boats, ships, tides, fish; he referred time he seen Mr. Peggotty Salem House; delighted he boat belonging it; lightly easily he carried on, he brought us, degrees, charmed circle, talking away without reserve. Them’ly, indeed, said little evening; she looked, listened, her face got animated, she charming. Steerforth told story dismal shipwreck (which arose his talk Mr. Peggotty), he saw him--and little Them’ly’s eyes fastened time, she saw too. He told us merry adventure his own, relief that, much gaiety narrative fresh us--and little Them’ly laughed boat rang musical sounds, laughed (Steerforth too), irresistible sympathy pleasant light-hearted. He got Mr. Peggotty sing, rather roar, ‘When stormy winds blow, blow, blow’; he sang sailor’s song himself, pathetically beautifully, I could almost fancied real wind creeping sorrowfully round house, murmuring low unbroken silence, listen. As Mrs. Gummidge, he roused victim despondency success never attained anyone else (so Mr. Peggotty informed me), since decease old one. He left her little leisure miserable, she said next day she thought she must bewitched. But he set monopoly general attention, conversation. When little Them’ly grew courageous, talked (but still bashfully) across fire me, old wanderings upon beach, pick shells pebbles; I asked her she recollected I used devoted her; laughed reddened, casting looks back pleasant old times, unreal look now; he silent attentive, observed us thoughtfully. She sat, time, evening, old locker her old little corner fire--Ham beside her, I used sit. I could satisfy whether her little tormenting way, maidenly reserve us, she kept quite close wall, away him; I observed she so, evening. As I remember, almost midnight took leave. We biscuit dried fish supper, Steerforth produced his pocket full flask Hollands, men (I may say men, now, without blush) emptied. We parted merrily; stood crowded round door light us far could upon road, I saw sweet blue eyes little Them’ly peeping us, behind Ham, heard her soft voice calling us careful went. ‘A engaging little Beauty!’ said Steerforth, taking arm. ‘Well! It is quaint place, quaint company, it is quite new sensation mix them.’ ‘How fortunate are, too,’ I returned, ‘to arrived witness happiness intended marriage! I never saw people happy. How delightful see it, made sharers honest joy, been!’ ‘That is rather chuckle-headed fellow girl; is not he?’ said Steerforth. He hearty him, all, I felt shock unexpected cold reply. But turning quickly upon him, seeing laugh his eyes, I answered, much relieved: ‘Ah, Steerforth! It is well joke poor! You may skirmish Miss Dartle, try hide sympathies jest me, I know better. When I see perfectly understand them, exquisitely enter happiness like plain fisherman’s, humour love like old nurse’s, I know joy sorrow, emotion, people, indifferent you. And I admire love it, Steerforth, twenty times more!’ He stopped, and, looking face, said, ‘Daisy, I believe earnest, good. I wish were!’ Next moment he gaily singing Mr. Peggotty’s song, walked round pace back Yarmouth. CHAPTER 22. SOME OLD SCENES, AND SOME NEW PEOPLE Steerforth I stayed fortnight part country. We much together, I need say; occasionally asunder hours time. He good sailor, I indifferent one; he went boating Mr. Peggotty, favourite amusement his, I generally remained ashore. My occupation Peggotty’s spare-room put constraint upon me, he free: for, knowing assiduously she attended Mr. Barkis day, I like remain late night; whereas Steerforth, lying Inn, nothing consult his humour. Thus came about, I heard his making little treats fishermen Mr. Peggotty’s house call, ‘The Willing Mind’, I bed, his afloat, wrapped fishermen’s clothes, whole moonlight nights, coming back morning tide flood. By time, however, I knew his restless nature bold spirits delighted find vent rough toil hard weather, means excitement presented freshly him; none his proceedings surprised me. Another sometimes apart, was, I naturally interest going Blunderstone, revisiting old familiar scenes childhood; Steerforth, once, naturally great interest going again. Hence, three four days I recall, went several ways early breakfast, met late dinner. I idea he employed his time interval, beyond general knowledge he popular place, twenty means actively diverting another man might found one. For part, occupation solitary pilgrimages recall every yard old road I went along it, haunt old spots, I never tired. I haunted them, memory often done, lingered among younger thoughts lingered I far away. The grave beneath tree, parents lay--on I looked out, father’s only, curious feelings compassion, I stood, desolate, opened receive pretty mother her baby--the grave Peggotty’s faithful care ever since kept neat, made garden of, I walked near, hour. It lay little churchyard path, quiet corner, far removed I could read names upon stone I walked fro, startled sound church-bell struck hour, like departed voice me. My reflections times always associated figure I make life, distinguished things I do. My echoing footsteps went tune, constant I come home build castles air living mother’s side. There great changes old home. The ragged nests, long deserted rooks, gone; trees lopped topped remembered shapes. The garden run wild, half windows house shut up. It occupied, poor lunatic gentleman, people took care him. He always sitting little window, looking churchyard; I wondered whether his rambling thoughts ever went upon fancies used occupy mine, rosy mornings I peeped little window night-clothes, saw sheep quietly feeding light rising sun. Our old neighbours, Mr. Mrs. Grayper, gone South America, rain made way roof empty house, stained outer walls. Mr. Chillip married tall, raw-boned, high-nosed wife; weazen little baby, heavy head could not hold up, two weak staring eyes, seemed always wondering ever born. It singular jumble sadness pleasure I used linger native place, reddening winter sun admonished time start returning walk. But, place left behind, especially Steerforth I happily seated dinner blazing fire, delicious think there. So was, though softened degree, I went neat room night; and, turning leaves crocodile-book (which always there, upon little table), remembered grateful heart blest I friend Steerforth, friend Peggotty, substitute I lost excellent generous aunt. MY nearest way Yarmouth, coming back long walks, ferry. It landed flat town sea, I could make straight across, save considerable circuit high road. Mr. Peggotty’s house waste-place, hundred yards track, I always looked I went by. Steerforth pretty sure expecting me, went together frosty air gathering fog towards twinkling lights town. One dark evening, I later usual--for I had, day, making parting visit Blunderstone, return home--I found alone Mr. Peggotty’s house, sitting thoughtfully fire. He intent upon his reflections he quite unconscious approach. This, indeed, he might easily he less absorbed, footsteps fell noiselessly sandy ground outside; even entrance failed rouse him. I standing close him, looking him; still, heavy brow, he lost his meditations. He gave start I put hand upon his shoulder, he made start too. ‘You come upon me,’ he said, almost angrily, ‘like reproachful ghost!’ ‘I obliged announce myself, somehow,’ I replied. ‘Have I called stars?’ ‘No,’ he answered. ‘No.’ ‘Up anywhere, then?’ said I, taking seat near him. ‘I looking pictures fire,’ he returned. ‘But spoiling me,’ said I, he stirred quickly piece burning wood, striking train red-hot sparks went careering little chimney, roaring air. ‘You would seen them,’ he returned. ‘I detest mongrel time, neither day night. How late are! Where been?’ ‘I taking leave usual walk,’ said I. ‘And I sitting here,’ said Steerforth, glancing round room, ‘thinking people found glad night coming down, might--to judge present wasted air place--be dispersed, dead, come I do not know harm. David, I wish God I judicious father last twenty years!’ ‘My dear Steerforth, matter?’ ‘I wish soul I better guided!’ he exclaimed. ‘I wish soul I could guide better!’ There passionate dejection his manner quite amazed me. He unlike I could supposed possible. ‘It would better poor Peggotty, his lout nephew,’ he said, getting leaning moodily chimney-piece, his face towards fire, ‘than myself, twenty times richer twenty times wiser, torment I been, Devil’s bark boat, within last half-hour!’ I confounded alteration him, first I could observe silence, he stood leaning his head upon his hand, looking gloomily fire. At length I begged him, earnestness I felt, tell occurred cross unusually, let sympathize him, I could hope advise him. Before I well concluded, he began laugh--fretfully first, soon returning gaiety. ‘Tut, it is nothing, Daisy! nothing!’ he replied. ‘I told inn London, I heavy company myself, sometimes. I nightmare myself, now--must one, I think. At odd dull times, nursery tales come memory, unrecognized are. I believe I confounding bad boy “did not care”, became food lions--a grander kind going dogs, I suppose. What old women call horrors, creeping head foot. I afraid myself.’ ‘You afraid nothing else, I think,’ said I. ‘Perhaps not, yet may enough afraid too,’ he answered. ‘Well! So goes by! I hipped again, David; I tell you, good fellow, more, would well (and me) I steadfast judicious father!’ His face always full expression, I never saw express dark kind earnestness he said words, his glance bent fire. ‘So much that!’ he said, making he tossed something light air, his hand. “‘Why, gone, I man again,” like Macbeth. And dinner! If I (Macbeth-like) broken feast admired disorder, Daisy.’ ‘But all, I wonder!’ said I. ‘God knows,’ said Steerforth. ‘After strolling ferry looking you, I strolled found place deserted. That set thinking, found thinking.’ The advent Mrs. Gummidge basket, explained house happened empty. She hurried buy something needed, Mr. Peggotty’s return tide; left door open meanwhile, lest Ham little Them’ly, early night, come home she gone. Steerforth, much improving Mrs. Gummidge’s spirits cheerful salutation jocose embrace, took arm, hurried away. He improved his spirits, less Mrs. Gummidge’s, usual flow, he full vivacious conversation went along. ‘And so,’ he said, gaily, ‘we abandon buccaneer life tomorrow, we?’ ‘So agreed,’ I returned. ‘And places coach taken, know.’ ‘Ay! there is help it, I suppose,’ said Steerforth. ‘I almost forgotten anything world go tossing sea here. I wish not.’ ‘As long novelty last,’ said I, laughing. ‘Like enough,’ he returned; ‘though there is sarcastic meaning observation amiable piece innocence like young friend. Well! I dare say I capricious fellow, David. I know I am; iron hot, I strike vigorously too. I could pass reasonably good examination already, pilot waters, I think.’ ‘Mr. Peggotty says wonder,’ I returned. ‘A nautical phenomenon, eh?’ laughed Steerforth. ‘Indeed he does, know truly; I know ardent pursuit follow, easily master it. And amazes you, Steerforth--that contented fitful uses powers.’ ‘Contented?’ he answered, merrily. ‘I never contented, except freshness, gentle Daisy. As fitfulness, I never learnt art binding wheels Ixions days turning round round. I missed somehow bad apprenticeship, do not care it.---You know I bought boat here?’ ‘What extraordinary fellow are, Steerforth!’ I exclaimed, stopping--for first I heard it. ‘When may never care come near place again!’ ‘I do not know that,’ he returned. ‘I taken fancy place. At events,’ walking briskly on, ‘I bought boat sale--a clipper, Mr. Peggotty says; she is--and Mr. Peggotty master her absence.’ ‘Now I understand you, Steerforth!’ said I, exultingly. ‘You pretend bought yourself, really done confer benefit him. I might known much first, knowing you. My dear kind Steerforth, I tell I think generosity?’ ‘Tush!’ he answered, turning red. ‘The less said, better.’ ‘Did not I know?’ cried I, ‘did not I say joy, sorrow, emotion honest hearts indifferent you?’ ‘Aye, aye,’ he answered, ‘you told that. There let rest. We said enough!’ Afraid offending pursuing subject he made light it, I pursued thoughts went even quicker pace before. ‘She must newly rigged,’ said Steerforth, ‘and I shall leave Littimer behind see done, I may know she quite complete. Did I tell Littimer come down?’ ‘No.’ ‘Oh yes! came morning, letter mother.’ As looks met, I observed he pale even his lips, though he looked steadily me. I feared difference his mother might led his frame mind I found solitary fireside. I hinted so. ‘Oh no!’ he said, shaking his head, giving slight laugh. ‘Nothing sort! Yes. He come down, man mine.’ ‘The ever?’ said I. ‘The ever,’ said Steerforth. ‘Distant quiet North Pole. He shall see boat fresh named. She is “Stormy Petrel” now. What Mr. Peggotty care Stormy Petrels! I will her christened again.’ ‘By name?’ I asked. ‘The “Little Them’ly”.’ As he continued look steadily me, I took reminder he objected extolled his consideration. I could help showing face much pleased me, I said little, he resumed his usual smile, seemed relieved. ‘But see here,’ he said, looking us, ‘where original little Them’ly comes! And fellow her, eh? Upon soul, he is true knight. He never leaves her!’ Ham boat-builder days, improved natural ingenuity handicraft, he become skilled workman. He his working-dress, looked rugged enough, manly withal, fit protector blooming little creature his side. Indeed, frankness his face, honesty, undisguised show his pride her, his love her, were, me, best good looks. I thought, came towards us, well matched even particular. She withdrew her hand timidly his arm stopped speak them, blushed she gave Steerforth me. When passed on, exchanged words, she like replace hand, but, still appearing timid constrained, walked herself. I thought pretty engaging, Steerforth seemed think too, looked fading away light young moon. Suddenly passed us--evidently following them--a young woman whose approach observed, whose face I saw she went by, thought I faint remembrance of. She lightly dressed; looked bold, haggard, flaunting, poor; seemed, time, given wind blowing, nothing her mind going them. As dark distant level, absorbing figures itself, left visible us sea clouds, her figure disappeared like manner, still nearer before. ‘That black shadow following girl,’ said Steerforth, standing still; ‘what mean?’ He spoke low voice sounded almost strange Me. ‘She must her mind beg them, I think,’ said I. ‘A beggar would novelty,’ said Steerforth; ‘but strange thing beggar take shape tonight.’ ‘Why?’ I asked. ‘For better reason, truly, I thinking,’ he said, pause, ‘of something like it, came by. Where Devil come from, I wonder!’ ‘From shadow wall, I think,’ said I, emerged upon road wall abutted. ‘It is gone!’ he returned, looking his shoulder. ‘And ill go it. Now dinner!’ But he looked his shoulder towards sea-line glimmering afar off, yet again. And he wondered it, broken expressions, several times, short remainder walk; seemed forget light fire candle shone upon us, seated warm merry, table. Littimer there, his usual effect upon me. When I said I hoped Mrs. Steerforth Miss Dartle well, he answered respectfully (and course respectably), tolerably well, he thanked me, sent compliments. This all, yet he seemed say plainly man could say: ‘You young, sir; exceedingly young.’ We almost finished dinner, taking step two towards table, corner he kept watch upon us, rather upon me, I felt, he said his master: ‘I beg pardon, sir. Miss Mowcher here.’ ‘Who?’ cried Steerforth, much astonished. ‘Miss Mowcher, sir.’ ‘Why, earth she here?’ said Steerforth. ‘It appears her native part country, sir. She informs she makes one her professional visits here, every year, sir. I met her street afternoon, she wished know she might honour waiting dinner, sir.’ ‘Do know Giantess question, Daisy?’ inquired Steerforth. I obliged confess--I felt ashamed, even disadvantage Littimer--that Miss Mowcher I wholly unacquainted. ‘Then shall know her,’ said Steerforth, ‘for she one seven wonders world. When Miss Mowcher comes, show her in.’ I felt curiosity excitement lady, especially Steerforth burst fit laughing I referred her, positively refused answer question I made her subject. I remained, therefore, state considerable expectation cloth removed half hour, sitting decanter wine fire, door opened, Littimer, his habitual serenity quite undisturbed, announced: ‘Miss Mowcher!’ I looked doorway saw nothing. I still looking doorway, thinking Miss Mowcher long making her appearance, when, infinite astonishment, came waddling round sofa stood it, pursy dwarf, forty forty-five, large head face, pair roguish grey eyes, extremely little arms, that, enable herself lay finger archly her snub nose, she ogled Steerforth, she obliged meet finger half-way, lay her nose it. Her chin, called double chin, fat entirely swallowed strings her bonnet, bow all. Throat she none; waist she none; legs she none, worth mentioning; though she full-sized her waist would been, she any, though she terminated, human beings generally do, pair feet, she short she stood common-sized chair table, resting bag she carried seat. This lady--dressed off-hand, easy style; bringing her nose her forefinger together, difficulty I described; standing her head necessarily one side, and, one her sharp eyes shut up, making uncommonly knowing face--after ogling Steerforth moments, broke torrent words. ‘What! My flower!’ she pleasantly began, shaking her large head him. ‘You are there, you! Oh, naughty boy, fie shame, far away home? Up mischief, I will bound. Oh, you are downy fellow, Steerforth, are, I am another, are not I? Ha, ha, ha! You would betted hundred pound five, now, would not seen here, would not you? Bless you, man alive, I am everywhere. I am there, not, like conjurer’s half-crown lady’s handkercher. Talking handkerchers--and talking ladies--what comfort blessed mother, are not you, dear boy, one shoulders, I do not say which!’ Miss Mowcher untied her bonnet, passage her discourse, threw back strings, sat down, panting, footstool front fire--making kind arbour dining table, spread mahogany shelter her head. ‘Oh stars what is-their-names!’ she went on, clapping hand her little knees, glancing shrewdly me, ‘I am full habit, that is fact, Steerforth. After flight stairs, gives much trouble draw every breath I want, bucket water. If saw looking upper window, you would think I fine woman, would not you?’ ‘I think that, wherever I saw you,’ replied Steerforth. ‘Go along, dog, do!’ cried little creature, making whisk handkerchief she wiping her face, ‘and do not impudent! But I give word honour I Lady Mithers’s last week--THERE IS woman! How SHE wears!--and Mithers came room I waiting her--THERE IS man! How HE wears! his wig too, he is ten years--and he went rate complimentary line, I began think I obliged ring bell. Ha! ha! ha! He is pleasant wretch, he wants principle.’ ‘What Lady Mithers?’ asked Steerforth. ‘That is tellings, blessed infant,’ she retorted, tapping her nose again, screwing her face, twinkling her eyes like imp supernatural intelligence. ‘Never YOU mind! You would like know whether I stop her hair falling off, dye it, touch her complexion, improve her eyebrows, would not you? And shall, darling--when I tell you! Do know great grandfather’s name was?’ ‘No,’ said Steerforth. ‘It Walker, sweet pet,’ replied Miss Mowcher, ‘and he came long line Walkers, I inherit Hookey estates from.’ I never beheld anything approaching Miss Mowcher’s wink except Miss Mowcher’s self-possession. She wonderful way too, listening said her, waiting answer she said herself, pausing her head cunningly one side, one eye turned like magpie’s. Altogether I lost amazement, sat staring her, quite oblivious, I afraid, laws politeness. She time drawn chair her side, busily engaged producing bag (plunging her short arm shoulder, every dive) number small bottles, sponges, combs, brushes, bits flannel, little pairs curling-irons, instruments, she tumbled heap upon chair. From employment she suddenly desisted, said Steerforth, much confusion: ‘Who is friend?’ ‘Mr. Copperfield,’ said Steerforth; ‘he wants know you.’ ‘Well, then, he shall! I thought he looked he did!’ returned Miss Mowcher, waddling me, bag hand, laughing she came. ‘Face like peach!’ standing tiptoe pinch cheek I sat. ‘Quite tempting! I am fond peaches. Happy make acquaintance, Mr. Copperfield, I am sure.’ I said I congratulated honour make hers, happiness mutual. ‘Oh, goodness, polite are!’ exclaimed Miss Mowcher, making preposterous attempt cover her large face her morsel hand. ‘What world gammon spinnage is, though, are not it!’ This addressed confidentially us, morsel hand came away face, buried itself, arm all, bag again. ‘What mean, Miss Mowcher?’ said Steerforth. ‘Ha! ha! ha! What refreshing set humbugs are, sure, are not we, sweet child?’ replied morsel woman, feeling bag her head one side her eye air. ‘Look here!’ taking something out. ‘Scraps Russian Prince’s nails. Prince Alphabet turned topsy-turvy, I call him, his name’s got letters it, higgledy-piggledy.’ ‘The Russian Prince client yours, he?’ said Steerforth. ‘I believe you, pet,’ replied Miss Mowcher. ‘I keep his nails order him. Twice week! Fingers toes.’ ‘He pays well, I hope?’ said Steerforth. ‘Pays, he speaks, dear child--through nose,’ replied Miss Mowcher. ‘None close shavers Prince are not. You would say so, saw his moustachios. Red nature, black art.’ ‘By art, course,’ said Steerforth. Miss Mowcher winked assent. ‘Forced send me. Could not help it. The climate affected his dye; well Russia, go here. You never saw rusty Prince born days he was. Like old iron!’ ‘Is called humbug, now?’ inquired Steerforth. ‘Oh, you are broth boy, are not you?’ returned Miss Mowcher, shaking her head violently. ‘I said, set humbugs general, I showed scraps Prince’s nails prove it. The Prince’s nails private families genteel sort, talents put together. I always carry ‘them about. They are best introduction. If Miss Mowcher cuts Prince’s nails, she must right. I give ‘them away young ladies. They put ‘them albums, I believe. Ha! ha! ha! Upon life, “the whole social system” (as men call make speeches Parliament) system Prince’s nails!’ said least women, trying fold her short arms, nodding her large head. Steerforth laughed heartily, I laughed too. Miss Mowcher continuing time shake her head (which much one side), look air one eye, wink other. ‘Well, well!’ she said, smiting her small knees, rising, ‘this business. Come, Steerforth, let us explore polar regions, over.’ She selected two three little instruments, little bottle, asked (to surprise) table would bear. On Steerforth’s replying affirmative, she pushed chair it, begging assistance hand, mounted up, pretty nimbly, top, stage. ‘If either saw ankles,’ she said, she safely elevated, ‘say so, I will go home destroy myself!’ ‘I not,’ said Steerforth. ‘I not,’ said I. ‘Well then,’ cried Miss Mowcher, ‘I will consent live. Now, ducky, ducky, ducky, come Mrs. Bond killed.’ This invocation Steerforth place her hands; who, accordingly, sat down, his back table, his laughing face towards me, submitted his head her inspection, evidently purpose entertainment. To see Miss Mowcher standing him, looking his rich profusion brown hair large round magnifying glass, she took her pocket, amazing spectacle. ‘You are pretty fellow!’ said Miss Mowcher, brief inspection. ‘You would bald friar top head twelve months, me. Just half minute, young friend, we will give polishing shall keep curls next ten years!’ With this, she tilted contents little bottle one little bits flannel, and, imparting virtues preparation one little brushes, began rubbing scraping away crown Steerforth’s head busiest manner I ever witnessed, talking time. ‘There is Charley Pyegrave, duke’s son,’ she said. ‘You know Charley?’ peeping round his face. ‘A little,’ said Steerforth. ‘What man HE is! THERE IS whisker! As Charley’s legs, pair (which are not), they would defy competition. Would believe he tried without me--in Life-Guards, too?’ ‘Mad!’ said Steerforth. ‘It looks like it. However, mad sane, he tried,’ returned Miss Mowcher. ‘What he do, but, lo behold you, he goes perfumer’s shop, wants buy bottle Madagascar Liquid.’ ‘Charley does?’ said Steerforth. ‘Charley does. But have not got Madagascar Liquid.’ ‘What it? Something drink?’ asked Steerforth. ‘To drink?’ returned Miss Mowcher, stopping slap his cheek. ‘To doctor his moustachios with, know. There woman shop--elderly female--quite Griffin--who never even heard name. “Begging pardon, sir,” said Griffin Charley, “it is not--not--not ROUGE, it?” “Rouge,” said Charley Griffin. “What unmentionable ears polite, think I want rouge?” “No offence, sir,” said Griffin; “we asked many names, I thought might be.” Now that, child,’ continued Miss Mowcher, rubbing time busily ever, ‘is another instance refreshing humbug I speaking of. I something way myself--perhaps good deal--perhaps little--sharp’s word, dear boy--never mind!’ ‘In way mean? In rouge way?’ said Steerforth. ‘Put together, tender pupil,’ returned wary Mowcher, touching her nose, ‘work rule Secrets trades, product give desired result. I say I little way myself. One Dowager, SHE calls lip-salve. Another, SHE calls gloves. Another, SHE calls tucker-edging. Another, SHE calls fan. I call whatever THEY call it. I supply ‘them, keep trick so, one another, make believe face, they would soon think laying on, whole drawing-room, me. And I wait upon ‘them, they will say sometimes--WITH IT ON--thick, mistake--“How I looking, Mowcher? Am I pale?” Ha! ha! ha! ha! Is not THAT refreshing, young friend!’ I never days behold anything like Mowcher she stood upon dining table, intensely enjoying refreshment, rubbing busily Steerforth’s head, winking it. ‘Ah!’ she said. ‘Such things much demand hereabouts. That sets again! I have not seen pretty woman since I have here, jemmy.’ ‘No?’ said Steerforth. ‘Not ghost one,’ replied Miss Mowcher. ‘We could show her substance one, I think?’ said Steerforth, addressing his eyes mine. ‘Eh, Daisy?’ ‘Yes, indeed,’ said I. ‘Aha?’ cried little creature, glancing sharply face, peeping round Steerforth’s. ‘Umph?’ The first exclamation sounded like question put us, second like question put Steerforth only. She seemed found answer either, continued rub, her head one side her eye turned up, she looking answer air confident appearing presently. ‘A sister yours, Mr. Copperfield?’ she cried, pause, still keeping look-out. ‘Aye, aye?’ ‘No,’ said Steerforth, I could reply. ‘Nothing sort. On contrary, Mr. Copperfield used--or I much mistaken--to great admiration her.’ ‘Why, has not he now?’ returned Miss Mowcher. ‘Is he fickle? Oh, shame! Did he sip every flower, change every hour, Polly his passion requited?--Is her name Polly?’ The Elfin suddenness she pounced upon question, searching look, quite disconcerted moment. ‘No, Miss Mowcher,’ I replied. ‘Her name Emily.’ ‘Aha?’ she cried exactly before. ‘Umph? What rattle I am! Mr. Copperfield, are not I volatile?’ Her tone look implied something agreeable connexion subject. So I said, graver manner us yet assumed: ‘She virtuous she pretty. She engaged married worthy deserving man her station life. I esteem her her good sense, much I admire her her good looks.’ ‘Well said!’ cried Steerforth. ‘Hear, hear, hear! Now I will quench curiosity little Fatima, dear Daisy, leaving her nothing guess at. She present apprenticed, Miss Mowcher, articled, whatever may be, Omer Joram, Haberdashers, Milliners, forth, town. Do observe? Omer Joram. The promise friend spoken, made entered her cousin; Christian name, Ham; surname, Peggotty; occupation, boat-builder; also town. She lives relative; Christian name, unknown; surname, Peggotty; occupation, seafaring; also town. She prettiest engaging little fairy world. I admire her--as friend does--exceedingly. If I might appear disparage her Intended, I know friend would like, I would add, she seems throwing herself away; I sure she might better; I swear she born lady.’ Miss Mowcher listened words, slowly distinctly spoken, her head one side, her eye air she still looking answer. When he ceased she became brisk instant, rattled away surprising volubility. ‘Oh! And that is it, it?’ she exclaimed, trimming his whiskers little restless pair scissors, went glancing round his head directions. ‘Very well: well! Quite long story. Ought end “and lived happy ever afterwards”; ought not it? Ah! What is game forfeits? I love love E, she is enticing; I hate her E, she is engaged. I took her sign exquisite, treated her elopement, her name’s Emily, she lives east? Ha! ha! ha! Mr. Copperfield, are not I volatile?’ Merely looking extravagant slyness, waiting reply, she continued, without drawing breath: ‘There! If ever scapegrace trimmed touched perfection, are, Steerforth. If I understand noddle world, I understand yours. Do hear I tell that, darling? I understand yours,’ peeping his face. ‘Now may mizzle, jemmy (as say Court), Mr. Copperfield take chair I will operate him.’ ‘What say, Daisy?’ inquired Steerforth, laughing, resigning his seat. ‘Will improved?’ ‘Thank you, Miss Mowcher, evening.’ ‘Do not say no,’ returned little woman, looking aspect connoisseur; ‘a little bit eyebrow?’ ‘Thank you,’ I returned, ‘some time.’ ‘Have carried half quarter inch towards temple,’ said Miss Mowcher. ‘We fortnight.’ ‘No, I thank you. Not present.’ ‘Go tip,’ she urged. ‘No? Let us get scaffolding up, then, pair whiskers. Come!’ I could help blushing I declined, I felt weak point, now. But Miss Mowcher, finding I present disposed decoration within range her art, I was, time being, proof blandishments small bottle she held one eye enforce her persuasions, said would make beginning early day, requested aid hand descend her elevated station. Thus assisted, she skipped much agility, began tie her double chin her bonnet. ‘The fee,’ said Steerforth, ‘is--’ ‘Five bob,’ replied Miss Mowcher, ‘and dirt cheap, chicken. Are not I volatile, Mr. Copperfield?’ I replied politely: ‘Not all.’ But I thought she rather so, she tossed his two half-crowns like goblin pieman, caught them, dropped her pocket, gave loud slap. ‘That is Till!’ observed Miss Mowcher, standing chair again, replacing bag miscellaneous collection little objects she emptied it. ‘Have I got traps? It seems so. It will not like long Ned Beadwood, took church “to marry somebody”, he says, left bride behind. Ha! ha! ha! A wicked rascal, Ned, droll! Now, I know I am going break hearts, I forced leave you. You must call fortitude, try bear it. Good-bye, Mr. Copperfield! Take care yourself, jockey Norfolk! How I rattling on! It is fault two wretches. I forgive you! “Bob swore!”--as Englishman said “Good night”, he first learnt French, thought like English. “Bob swore,” ducks!’ With bag slung her arm, rattling she waddled away, she waddled door, she stopped inquire she leave us lock her hair. ‘Are not I volatile?’ she added, commentary offer, and, her finger her nose, departed. Steerforth laughed degree, impossible help laughing too; though I sure I done so, inducement. When laugh quite out, time, he told Miss Mowcher quite extensive connexion, made herself useful variety people variety ways. Some people trifled her mere oddity, he said; she shrewdly sharply observant anyone he knew, long-headed she short-armed. He told she said here, there, everywhere, true enough; she made little darts provinces, seemed pick customers everywhere, know everybody. I asked her disposition was: whether mischievous, her sympathies generally right side things: but, succeeding attracting his attention questions two three attempts, I forbore forgot repeat them. He told instead, much rapidity, good deal her skill, her profits; her scientific cupper, I ever occasion her service capacity. She principal theme conversation evening: parted night Steerforth called banisters, ‘Bob swore!’ I went downstairs. I surprised, I came Mr. Barkis’s house, find Ham walking front it, still surprised learn little Them’ly inside. I naturally inquired he too, instead pacing streets himself? ‘Why, see, Mas’r Davy,’ he rejoined, hesitating manner, ‘Them’ly, she is talking ‘un here.’ ‘I thought,’ said I, smiling, ‘that reason too, Ham.’ ‘Well, Mas’r Davy, general way, ‘t would be,’ he returned; ‘but look’ee here, Mas’r Davy,’ lowering his voice, speaking gravely. ‘It is young woman, sir--a young woman, Them’ly knowed once, doen’t ought know more.’ When I heard words, light began fall upon figure I seen following them, hours ago. ‘It is poor wurem, Mas’r Davy,’ said Ham, ‘as trod foot town. Up street street. The mowld churchyard do not hold folk shrink away from, more.’ ‘Did I see her tonight, Ham, sand, met you?’ ‘Keeping us sight?’ said Ham. ‘It is like did, Mas’r Davy. Not I know’d then, she theer, sir, along her creeping soon arterwards Them’ly’s little winder, she see light come, whispering “Them’ly, Them’ly, Christ’s sake, woman’s heart towards me. I like you!” Those solemn words, Mas’r Davy, fur hear!’ ‘They indeed, Ham. What Them’ly do?’ ‘Says Them’ly, “Martha, you? Oh, Martha, you?”--for sat work together, many day, Mr. Omer’s.’ ‘I recollect her now!’ cried I, recalling one two girls I seen I first went there. ‘I recollect her quite well!’ ‘Martha Endell,’ said Ham. ‘Two three year older Them’ly, school her.’ ‘I never heard her name,’ said I. ‘I did not mean interrupt you.’ ‘For matter that, Mas’r Davy,’ replied Ham, ‘all’s told a’most words, “Them’ly, Them’ly, Christ’s sake, woman’s heart towards me. I like you!” She wanted speak Them’ly. Them’ly could not speak her theer, her loving uncle come home, he would not--no, Mas’r Davy,’ said Ham, great earnestness, ‘he could not, kind-natur’d, tender-hearted he is, see two together, side side, treasures that is wrecked sea.’ I felt true was. I knew it, instant, quite well Ham. ‘So Them’ly writes pencil bit paper,’ he pursued, ‘and gives her winder bring here. “Show that,” she says, “to aunt, Mrs. Barkis, she will set her fire, love me, till uncle gone out, I come.” By she tells I tell you, Mas’r Davy, asks bring her. What I do? She doen’t ought know such, I cannot deny her, tears her face.’ He put his hand breast his shaggy jacket, took great care pretty little purse. ‘And I could deny her tears her face, Mas’r Davy,’ said Ham, tenderly adjusting rough palm his hand, ‘how could I deny her she give carry her--knowing she brought for? Such toy is!’ said Ham, thoughtfully looking it. ‘With little money it, Them’ly dear.’ I shook warmly hand he put away again--for satisfactory saying anything--and walked down, minute two, silence. The door opened then, Peggotty appeared, beckoning Ham come in. I would kept away, she came me, entreating come too. Even then, I would avoided room were, neat-tiled kitchen I mentioned once. The door opening immediately it, I found among I considered whither I going. The girl--the I seen upon sands--was near fire. She sitting ground, her head one arm lying chair. I fancied, disposition her figure, Them’ly newly risen chair, forlorn head might perhaps lying her lap. I saw little girl’s face, her hair fell loose scattered, she disordering her hands; I saw she young, fair complexion. Peggotty crying. So little Them’ly. Not word spoken first went in; Dutch clock dresser seemed, silence, tick twice loud usual. Them’ly spoke first. ‘Martha wants,’ she said Ham, ‘to go London.’ ‘Why London?’ returned Ham. He stood them, looking prostrate girl mixture compassion her, jealousy her holding companionship her he loved well, I always remembered distinctly. They spoke she ill; soft, suppressed tone plainly heard, although hardly rose whisper. ‘Better here,’ said third voice aloud--Martha’s, though she move. ‘No one knows there. Everybody knows here.’ ‘What she there?’ inquired Ham. She lifted her head, looked darkly round moment; laid again, curved her right arm her neck, woman fever, agony pain shot, might twist herself. ‘She try well,’ said little Them’ly. ‘You do not know she said us. Does he--do they--aunt?’ Peggotty shook her head compassionately. ‘I will try,’ said Martha, ‘if you will help away. I never worse I done here. I may better. Oh!’ dreadful shiver, ‘take streets, whole town knows child!’ As Them’ly held her hand Ham, I saw put little canvas bag. She took it, she thought her purse, made step two forward; finding her mistake, came back he retired near me, showed him. ‘It is yourn, Them’ly,’ I could hear say. ‘I have not nowt wureld are not yourn, dear. It are not delight me, except you!’ The tears rose freshly her eyes, she turned away went Martha. What she gave her, I do not know. I saw her stooping her, putting money her bosom. She whispered something, she asked enough? ‘More enough,’ said, took her hand kissed it. Then Martha arose, gathering her shawl her, covering her face it, weeping aloud, went slowly door. She stopped moment going out, she would uttered something turned back; word passed her lips. Making low, dreary, wretched moaning her shawl, she went away. As door closed, little Them’ly looked us three hurried manner hid her face her hands, fell sobbing. ‘Doen’t, Them’ly!’ said Ham, tapping her gently shoulder. ‘Doen’t, dear! You doen’t ought cry so, pretty!’ ‘Oh, Ham!’ she exclaimed, still weeping pitifully, ‘I good girl I ought be! I know I thankful heart, sometimes, I ought have!’ ‘Yes, yes, have, I am sure,’ said Ham. ‘No! no! no!’ cried little Them’ly, sobbing, shaking her head. ‘I good girl I ought be. Not near! near!’ And still she cried, her heart would break. ‘I try love much. I know I do!’ she sobbed. ‘I am often cross you, changeable you, I ought far different. You never me. Why I ever you, I think nothing grateful, make happy!’ ‘You always make so,’ said Ham, ‘my dear! I happy sight you. I happy, day long, thoughts you.’ ‘Ah! that is enough!’ she cried. ‘That good; I am! Oh, dear, might better fortune you, fond someone else--of someone steadier much worthier me, bound you, never vain changeable like me!’ ‘Poor little tender-heart,’ said Ham, low voice. ‘Martha overset her, altogether.’ ‘Please, aunt,’ sobbed Them’ly, ‘come here, let lay head upon you. Oh, I miserable tonight, aunt! Oh, I good girl I ought be. I not, I know!’ Peggotty hastened chair fire. Them’ly, her arms around her neck, kneeled her, looking earnestly her face. ‘Oh, pray, aunt, try help me! Ham, dear, try help me! Mr. David, sake old times, do, please, try help me! I want better girl I am. I want feel hundred times thankful I do. I want feel more, blessed thing wife good man, lead peaceful life. Oh me, oh me! Oh heart, heart!’ She dropped her face old nurse’s breast, and, ceasing supplication, agony grief half woman’s, half child’s, her manner (being, that, natural, better suited her beauty, I thought, manner could been), wept silently, old nurse hushed her like infant. She got calmer degrees, soothed her; talking encouragingly, jesting little her, she began raise her head speak us. So got on, she able smile, laugh, sit up, half ashamed; Peggotty recalled her stray ringlets, dried her eyes, made her neat again, lest her uncle wonder, she got home, his darling crying. I saw her do, night, I never seen her before. I saw her innocently kiss her chosen husband cheek, creep close his bluff form her best support. When went away together, waning moonlight, I looked them, comparing departure mind Martha’s, I saw she held his arm her hands, still kept close him. CHAPTER 23. I CORROBORATE Mr. DICK, AND CHOOSE A PROFESSION When I awoke morning I thought much little Them’ly, her emotion last night, Martha left. I felt I come knowledge domestic weaknesses tendernesses sacred confidence, disclose them, even Steerforth, would wrong. I gentler feeling towards anyone towards pretty creature playmate, I always persuaded, shall always persuaded, dying day, I devotedly loved. The repetition ears--even Steerforth’s--of she unable repress her heart lay open accident, I felt would rough deed, unworthy myself, unworthy light pure childhood, I always saw encircling her head. I made resolution, therefore, keep breast; gave her image new grace. While breakfast, letter delivered aunt. As contained matter I thought Steerforth could advise well anyone, I knew I delighted consult him, I resolved make subject discussion journey home. For present enough do, taking leave friends. Mr. Barkis far last among them, his regret departure; I believe would even opened box again, sacrificed another guinea, would kept us eight-and-forty hours Yarmouth. Peggotty her family full grief going. The whole house Omer Joram turned bid us good-bye; many seafaring volunteers attendance Steerforth, portmanteaux went coach, baggage regiment us, hardly wanted porters carry it. In word, departed regret admiration concerned, left great many people sorry behind US. ‘Do stay long here, Littimer?’ said I, he stood waiting see coach start. ‘No, sir,’ he replied; ‘probably long, sir.’ ‘He hardly say, now,’ observed Steerforth, carelessly. ‘He knows he do, he will it.’ ‘That I sure he will,’ said I. Littimer touched his hat acknowledgement good opinion, I felt eight years old. He touched more, wishing us good journey; left standing pavement, respectable mystery pyramid Egypt. For little time held conversation, Steerforth unusually silent, I sufficiently engaged wondering, within myself, I see old places again, new changes might happen meanwhile. At length Steerforth, becoming gay talkative moment, he could become anything he liked moment, pulled arm: ‘Find voice, David. What letter speaking breakfast?’ ‘Oh!’ said I, taking pocket. ‘It is aunt.’ ‘And she say, requiring consideration?’ ‘Why, she reminds me, Steerforth,’ said I, ‘that I came expedition look me, think little.’ ‘Which, course, done?’ ‘Indeed I cannot say I have, particularly. To tell truth, I afraid I forgotten it.’ ‘Well! look now, make negligence,’ said Steerforth. ‘Look right, you will see flat country, good deal marsh it; look left, you will see same. Look front, you will find difference; look rear, still.’ I laughed, replied I saw suitable profession whole prospect; perhaps attributed flatness. ‘What says aunt subject?’ inquired Steerforth, glancing letter hand. ‘Does she suggest anything?’ ‘Why, yes,’ said I. ‘She asks me, here, I think I like proctor? What think it?’ ‘Well, I do not know,’ replied Steerforth, coolly. ‘You may well anything else, I suppose?’ I could help laughing again, his balancing callings professions equally; I told so. ‘What proctor, Steerforth?’ said I. ‘Why, he sort monkish attorney,’ replied Steerforth. ‘He is, faded courts held Doctors’ Commons,--a lazy old nook near St. Paul’s Churchyard--what solicitors courts law equity. He functionary whose existence, natural course things, would terminated two hundred years ago. I tell best he is, telling Doctors’ Commons is. It is little out-of-the-way place, administer called ecclesiastical law, play kinds tricks obsolete old monsters acts Parliament, three-fourths world know nothing about, fourth supposes dug up, fossil state, days Edwards. It is place ancient monopoly suits people’s wills people’s marriages, disputes among ships boats.’ ‘Nonsense, Steerforth!’ I exclaimed. ‘You do not mean say affinity nautical matters ecclesiastical matters?’ ‘I do not, indeed, dear boy,’ he returned; ‘but I mean say managed decided set people, Doctors’ Commons. You shall go one day, find blundering half nautical terms Young’s Dictionary, apropos “Nancy” run “Sarah Jane”, Mr. Peggotty Yarmouth boatmen put gale wind anchor cable “Nelson” Indiaman distress; shall go another day, find deep evidence, pro con, respecting clergyman misbehaved himself; shall find judge nautical case, advocate clergyman’s case, contrariwise. They like actors: man’s judge, he judge; he is one thing, he is another; he is something else, change change about; it is always pleasant, profitable little affair private theatricals, presented uncommonly select audience.’ ‘But advocates proctors one same?’ said I, little puzzled. ‘Are they?’ ‘No,’ returned Steerforth, ‘the advocates civilians--men taken doctor’s degree college--which first reason knowing anything it. The proctors employ advocates. Both get comfortable fees, altogether make mighty snug little party. On whole, I would recommend take Doctors’ Commons kindly, David. They plume gentility there, I tell you, that is satisfaction.’ I made allowance Steerforth’s light way treating subject, and, considering reference staid air gravity antiquity I associated ‘lazy old nook near St. Paul’s Churchyard’, feel indisposed towards aunt’s suggestion; she left free decision, making scruple telling occurred her, her lately visiting her proctor Doctors’ Commons purpose settling her favour. ‘That is laudable proceeding part aunt, events,’ said Steerforth, I mentioned it; ‘and one deserving encouragement. Daisy, advice take kindly Doctors’ Commons.’ I quite made mind so. I told Steerforth aunt town awaiting (as I found her letter), she taken lodgings week kind private hotel Lincoln’s Inn Fields, stone staircase, convenient door roof; aunt firmly persuaded every house London going burnt every night. We achieved rest journey pleasantly, sometimes recurring Doctors’ Commons, anticipating distant days I proctor there, Steerforth pictured variety humorous whimsical lights, made us merry. When came journey’s end, he went home, engaging call upon next day one; I drove Lincoln’s Inn Fields, I found aunt up, waiting supper. If I round world since parted, could hardly better pleased meet again. My aunt cried outright she embraced me; said, pretending laugh, poor mother alive, silly little creature would she would tears, she doubt. ‘So left Mr. Dick behind, aunt?’ said I. ‘I sorry that. Ah, Janet, do?’ As Janet curtsied, hoping I well, I observed aunt’s visage lengthen much. ‘I sorry it, too,’ said aunt, rubbing her nose. ‘I peace mind, Trot, since I here.’ Before I could ask why, she told me. ‘I convinced,’ said aunt, laying her hand melancholy firmness table, ‘that Dick’s character character keep donkeys off. I confident he wants strength purpose. I ought left Janet home, instead, mind might perhaps ease. If ever donkey trespassing green,’ said aunt, emphasis, ‘there one afternoon four of the clock. A cold feeling came head foot, I know donkey!’ I tried comfort her point, she rejected consolation. ‘It donkey,’ said aunt; ‘and one stumpy tail Murdering sister woman rode, she came house.’ This been, ever since, name aunt knew Miss Murdstone. ‘If Donkey Dover, whose audacity harder bear another’s, that,’ said aunt, striking table, ‘is animal!’ Janet ventured suggest aunt might disturbing herself unnecessarily, she believed donkey question engaged sand-and-gravel line business, available purposes trespass. But aunt would not hear it. Supper comfortably served hot, though aunt’s rooms high up--whether she might stone stairs her money, might nearer door roof, I do not know--and consisted roast fowl, steak, vegetables, I ample justice, excellent. But aunt her ideas concerning London provision, ate little. ‘I suppose unfortunate fowl born brought cellar,’ said aunt, ‘and never took air except hackney coach-stand. I hope steak may beef, I do not believe it. Nothing’s genuine place, opinion, dirt.’ ‘Do not think fowl may come country, aunt?’ I hinted. ‘Certainly not,’ returned aunt. ‘It would pleasure London tradesman sell anything he pretended was.’ I venture controvert opinion, I made good supper, greatly satisfied her see do. When table cleared, Janet assisted her arrange her hair, put her nightcap, smarter construction usual [‘in case fire’, aunt said), fold her gown back her knees, her usual preparations warming herself going bed. I made her, according certain established regulations deviation, however slight, could ever permitted, glass hot wine water, slice toast cut long thin strips. With accompaniments left alone finish evening, aunt sitting opposite drinking her wine water; soaking her strips toast it, one one, eating them; looking benignantly me, among borders her nightcap. ‘Well, Trot,’ she began, ‘what think proctor plan? Or begun think yet?’ ‘I thought good deal it, dear aunt, I talked good deal Steerforth. I like much indeed. I like exceedingly.’ ‘Come!’ said aunt. ‘That is cheering!’ ‘I one difficulty, aunt.’ ‘Say is, Trot,’ she returned. ‘Why, I want ask, aunt, seems, I understand, limited profession, whether entrance would expensive?’ ‘It cost,’ returned aunt, ‘to article you, thousand pounds.’ ‘Now, dear aunt,’ said I, drawing chair nearer, ‘I uneasy mind that. It is large sum money. You expended great deal education, always liberal things possible be. You soul generosity. Surely ways I might begin life hardly outlay, yet begin good hope getting resolution exertion. Are sure would better try course? Are certain afford part much money, right expended? I ask you, second mother, consider. Are certain?’ My aunt finished eating piece toast she engaged, looking full face while; setting her glass chimney-piece, folding her hands upon her folded skirts, replied follows: ‘Trot, child, I object life, provide good, sensible, happy man. I bent upon it--so Dick. I like people I know hear Dick’s conversation subject. Its sagacity wonderful. But one knows resources man’s intellect, except myself!’ She stopped moment take hand hers, went on: ‘It is vain, Trot, recall past, unless works influence upon present. Perhaps I might better friends poor father. Perhaps I might better friends poor child mother, even sister Betsey Trotwood disappointed me. When came me, little runaway boy, dusty way-worn, perhaps I thought so. From time now, Trot, ever credit pride pleasure. I claim upon means; least’--here surprise she hesitated, confused--‘no, I claim upon means--and adopted child. Only loving child age, bear whims fancies; old woman whose prime life happy conciliating might been, ever old woman you.’ It first time I heard aunt refer her past history. There magnanimity her quiet way so, dismissing it, would exalted her respect affection, anything could. ‘All agreed understood us, now, Trot,’ said aunt, ‘and need talk more. Give kiss, we will go Commons breakfast tomorrow.’ We long chat fire went bed. I slept room floor aunt’s, little disturbed course night her knocking door often she agitated distant sound hackney-coaches market-carts, inquiring, ‘if I heard engines?’ But towards morning she slept better, suffered too. At mid-day, set office Messrs Spenlow Jorkins, Doctors’ Commons. My aunt, general opinion reference London, every man she saw pickpocket, gave her purse carry her, ten guineas silver. We made pause toy shop Fleet Street, see giants Saint Dunstan’s strike upon bells--we timed going, catch it, twelve of the clock--and went towards Ludgate Hill, St. Paul’s Churchyard. We crossing former place, I found aunt greatly accelerated her speed, looked frightened. I observed, time, lowering ill-dressed man stopped stared us passing, little before, coming close us brush her. ‘Trot! My dear Trot!’ cried aunt, terrified whisper, pressing arm. ‘I do not know I do.’ ‘Do not alarmed,’ said I. ‘There is nothing afraid of. Step shop, I will soon get rid fellow.’ ‘No, no, child!’ she returned. ‘Do not speak world. I entreat, I order you!’ ‘Good Heaven, aunt!’ said I. ‘He nothing sturdy beggar.’ ‘You do not know he is!’ replied aunt. ‘You do not know he is! You do not know say!’ We stopped empty door-way, passing, he stopped too. ‘Do not look him!’ said aunt, I turned head indignantly, ‘but get coach, dear, wait St. Paul’s Churchyard.’ ‘Wait you?’ I replied. ‘Yes,’ rejoined aunt. ‘I must go alone. I must go him.’ ‘With him, aunt? This man?’ ‘I senses,’ she replied, ‘and I tell I must. Get coach!’ However much astonished I might be, I sensible I right refuse compliance peremptory command. I hurried away paces, called hackney-chariot passing empty. Almost I could let steps, aunt sprang in, I do not know how, man followed. She waved her hand go away, earnestly, that, confounded I was, I turned once. In so, I heard her say coachman, ‘Drive anywhere! Drive straight on!’ presently chariot passed me, going hill. What Mr. Dick told me, I supposed delusion his, came mind. I could doubt person person he made mysterious mention, though nature his hold upon aunt could possibly be, I quite unable imagine. After half hour’s cooling churchyard, I saw chariot coming back. The driver stopped beside me, aunt sitting alone. She yet sufficiently recovered her agitation quite prepared visit make. She desired get chariot, tell coachman drive slowly little while. She said more, except, ‘My dear child, never ask was, do not refer it,’ she perfectly regained her composure, she told she quite herself now, might get out. On her giving her purse pay driver, I found guineas gone, loose silver remained. Doctors’ Commons approached little low archway. Before taken many paces street beyond it, noise city seemed melt, magic, softened distance. A dull courts narrow ways brought us sky-lighted offices Spenlow Jorkins; vestibule temple, accessible pilgrims without ceremony knocking, three four clerks work copyists. One these, little dry man, sitting himself, wore stiff brown wig looked made gingerbread, rose receive aunt, show us Mr. Spenlow’s room. ‘Mr. Spenlow’s Court, madam,’ said dry man; ‘it is Arches day; it is close by, I will send directly.’ As left look us Mr. Spenlow fetched, I availed opportunity. The furniture room old-fashioned dusty; green baize top writing-table lost colour, withered pale old pauper. There great many bundles papers it, endorsed Allegations, (to surprise) Libels, Consistory Court, Arches Court, Prerogative Court, Admiralty Court, Delegates’ Court; giving occasion wonder much, many Courts might gross, long would take understand all. Besides these, sundry immense manuscript Books Evidence taken affidavit, strongly bound, tied together massive sets, set because, every history ten twenty volumes. All looked tolerably expensive, I thought, gave agreeable notion proctor’s business. I casting eyes increasing complacency many similar objects, hasty footsteps heard room outside, Mr. Spenlow, black gown trimmed white fur, came hurrying in, taking his hat he came. He little light-haired gentleman, undeniable boots, stiffest white cravats shirt-collars. He buttoned up, mighty trim tight, must taken great deal pains his whiskers, accurately curled. His gold watch-chain massive, fancy came across me, he ought sinewy golden arm, draw with, like put goldbeaters’ shops. He got care, stiff, he could hardly bend himself; obliged, he glanced papers his desk, sitting his chair, move his whole body, bottom his spine, like Punch. I previously presented aunt, courteously received. He said: ‘And so, Mr. Copperfield, think entering profession? I casually mentioned Miss Trotwood, I pleasure interview her day,’--with another inclination his body--Punch again--‘that vacancy here. Miss Trotwood good enough mention she nephew her peculiar care, she seeking provide genteelly life. That nephew, I believe, I pleasure of’--Punch again. I bowed acknowledgements, said, aunt mentioned opening, I believed I like much. That I strongly inclined like it, taken immediately proposal. That I could absolutely pledge like it, I knew something it. That although little else matter form, I presumed I opportunity trying I liked it, I bound irrevocably. ‘Oh surely! surely!’ said Mr. Spenlow. ‘We always, house, propose month--an initiatory month. I happy, myself, propose two months--three--an indefinite period, fact--but I partner. Mr. Jorkins.’ ‘And premium, sir,’ I returned, ‘is thousand pounds?’ ‘And premium, Stamp included, thousand pounds,’ said Mr. Spenlow. ‘As I mentioned Miss Trotwood, I actuated mercenary considerations; men less so, I believe; Mr. Jorkins his opinions subjects, I bound respect Mr. Jorkins’s opinions. Mr. Jorkins thinks thousand pounds little, short.’ ‘I suppose, sir,’ said I, still desiring spare aunt, ‘that custom here, articled clerk particularly useful, made perfect master his profession’--I could help blushing, looked like praising myself--‘I suppose custom, later years his time, allow any--’ Mr. Spenlow, great effort, lifted his head far enough his cravat shake it, answered, anticipating word ‘salary’: ‘No. I say consideration I might give point myself, Mr. Copperfield, I unfettered. Mr. Jorkins immovable.’ I quite dismayed idea terrible Jorkins. But I found afterwards he mild man heavy temperament, whose place business keep background, constantly exhibited name obdurate ruthless men. If clerk wanted his salary raised, Mr. Jorkins would not listen proposition. If client slow settle his bill costs, Mr. Jorkins resolved paid; however painful things might (and always were) feelings Mr. Spenlow, Mr. Jorkins would his bond. The heart hand good angel Spenlow would always open, restraining demon Jorkins. As I grown older, I think I experience houses business principle Spenlow Jorkins! It settled I begin month’s probation soon I pleased, aunt need neither remain town return expiration, articles agreement, I subject, could easily sent her home her signature. When got far, Mr. Spenlow offered take Court there, show sort place was. As I willing enough know, went object, leaving aunt behind; would trust herself, she said, place, who, I think, regarded Courts Law sort powder-mills might blow time. Mr. Spenlow conducted paved courtyard formed grave brick houses, I inferred, Doctors’ names upon doors, official abiding-places learned advocates Steerforth told me; large dull room, unlike chapel thinking, left hand. The upper part room fenced rest; there, two sides raised platform horse-shoe form, sitting easy old-fashioned dining-room chairs, sundry gentlemen red gowns grey wigs, I found Doctors aforesaid. Blinking little desk like pulpit-desk, curve horse-shoe, old gentleman, whom, I seen aviary, I certainly taken owl, who, I learned, presiding judge. In space within horse-shoe, lower these, say, level floor, sundry gentlemen, Mr. Spenlow’s rank, dressed like black gowns white fur upon them, sitting long green table. Their cravats general stiff, I thought, looks haughty; last respect I presently conceived I done injustice, two three rise answer question presiding dignitary, I never saw anything sheepish. The public, represented boy comforter, shabby-genteel man secretly eating crumbs his coat pockets, warming stove centre Court. The languid stillness place broken chirping fire voice one Doctors, wandering slowly perfect library evidence, stopping put up, time time, little roadside inns argument journey. Altogether, I never, occasion, made one cosey, dosey, old-fashioned, time-forgotten, sleepy-headed little family-party life; I felt would quite soothing opiate belong character--except perhaps suitor. Very well satisfied dreamy nature retreat, I informed Mr. Spenlow I seen enough time, rejoined aunt; company I presently departed Commons, feeling young I went Spenlow Jorkins’s, account clerks poking one another pens point out. We arrived Lincoln’s Inn Fields without new adventures, except encountering unlucky donkey costermonger’s cart, suggested painful associations aunt. We another long talk plans, safely housed; I knew she anxious get home, and, fire, food, pickpockets, could never considered her ease half-an-hour London, I urged her uncomfortable account, leave take care myself. ‘I week tomorrow, without considering too, dear,’ she returned. ‘There furnished little set chambers let Adelphi, Trot, ought suit marvel.’ With brief introduction, she produced her pocket advertisement, carefully cut newspaper, setting forth Buckingham Street Adelphi let furnished, view river, singularly desirable, compact set chambers, forming genteel residence young gentleman, member one Inns Court, otherwise, immediate possession. Terms moderate, could taken month only, required. ‘Why, thing, aunt!’ said I, flushed possible dignity living chambers. ‘Then come,’ replied aunt, immediately resuming bonnet she minute laid aside. ‘We will go look ‘them.’ Away went. The advertisement directed us apply Mrs. Crupp premises, rung area bell, supposed communicate Mrs. Crupp. It rung three four times could prevail Mrs. Crupp communicate us, last she appeared, stout lady flounce flannel petticoat nankeen gown. ‘Let us see chambers yours, please, madam,’ said aunt. ‘For gentleman?’ said Mrs. Crupp, feeling her pocket her keys. ‘Yes, nephew,’ said aunt. ‘And sweet set sich!’ said Mrs. Crupp. So went upstairs. They top house--a great point aunt, near fire-escape--and consisted little half-blind entry could see hardly anything, little stone-blind pantry could see nothing all, sitting-room, bedroom. The furniture rather faded, quite good enough me; and, sure enough, river outside windows. As I delighted place, aunt Mrs. Crupp withdrew pantry discuss terms, I remained sitting-room sofa, hardly daring think possible I could destined live noble residence. After single combat duration returned, I saw, joy, Mrs. Crupp’s countenance aunt’s, deed done. ‘Is last occupant’s furniture?’ inquired aunt. ‘Yes, is, madam,’ said Mrs. Crupp. ‘What is become him?’ asked aunt. Mrs. Crupp taken troublesome cough, midst she articulated much difficulty. ‘He took ill here, madam, and--ugh! ugh! ugh! dear me!--and he died!’ ‘Hey! What he die of?’ asked aunt. ‘Well, madam, he died drink,’ said Mrs. Crupp, confidence. ‘And smoke.’ ‘Smoke? You do not mean chimneys?’ said aunt. ‘No, madam,’ returned Mrs. Crupp. ‘Cigars pipes.’ ‘That is catching, Trot, rate,’ remarked aunt, turning me. ‘No, indeed,’ said I. In short, aunt, seeing enraptured I premises, took month, leave remain twelve months time out. Mrs. Crupp find linen, cook; every necessary already provided; Mrs. Crupp expressly intimated she always yearn towards son. I take possession day tomorrow, Mrs. Crupp said, thank Heaven she found summun she could care for! On way back, aunt informed she confidently trusted life I lead would make firm self-reliant, I wanted. She repeated several times next day, intervals arranging transmission clothes books Mr. Wickfield’s; relative which, late holiday, I wrote long letter Agnes, aunt took charge, she leave succeeding day. Not lengthen particulars, I need add, she made handsome provision possible wants month trial; Steerforth, great disappointment too, make his appearance she went away; I saw her safely seated Dover coach, exulting coming discomfiture vagrant donkeys, Janet her side; coach gone, I turned face Adelphi, pondering old days I used roam subterranean arches, happy changes brought surface. CHAPTER 24. MY FIRST DISSIPATION It wonderfully fine thing lofty castle myself, feel, I shut outer door, like Robinson Crusoe, he got his fortification, pulled his ladder him. It wonderfully fine thing walk town key house pocket, know I could ask fellow come home, make quite sure inconvenient nobody, me. It wonderfully fine thing let out, come go without word anyone, ring Mrs. Crupp up, gasping, depths earth, I wanted her--and she disposed come. All this, I say, wonderfully fine; I must say, too, times dreary. It fine morning, particularly fine mornings. It looked fresh, free life, daylight: still fresher, free, sunlight. But day declined, life seemed go too. I do not know was; seldom looked well candle-light. I wanted somebody talk to, then. I missed Agnes. I found tremendous blank, place smiling repository confidence. Mrs. Crupp appeared long way off. I thought predecessor, died drink smoke; I could wished he good live, bother his decease. After two days nights, I felt I lived year, yet I hour older, quite much tormented youthfulness ever. Steerforth yet appearing, induced apprehend he must ill, I left Commons early third day, walked Highgate. Mrs. Steerforth glad see me, said he gone away one his Oxford friends see another lived near St. Albans, she expected return tomorrow. I fond him, I felt quite jealous his Oxford friends. As she pressed stay dinner, I remained, I believe talked nothing day. I told her much people liked Yarmouth, delightful companion he been. Miss Dartle full hints mysterious questions, took great interest proceedings there, said, ‘Was really though?’ forth, often, she got everything she wanted know. Her appearance exactly I described it, I first saw her; society two ladies agreeable, came natural me, I felt falling little love her. I could help thinking, several times course evening, particularly I walked home night, delightful company she would Buckingham Street. I taking coffee roll morning, going Commons--and I may observe place surprising much coffee Mrs. Crupp used, weak was, considering--when Steerforth walked in, unbounded joy. ‘My dear Steerforth,’ cried I, ‘I began think I never see again!’ ‘I carried off, force arms,’ said Steerforth, ‘the next morning I got home. Why, Daisy, rare old bachelor here!’ I showed establishment, omitting pantry, little pride, he commended highly. ‘I tell what, old boy,’ he added, ‘I shall make quite town-house place, unless give notice quit.’ This delightful hearing. I told he waited that, he would wait till doomsday. ‘But shall breakfast!’ said I, hand bell-rope, ‘and Mrs. Crupp shall make fresh coffee, I will toast bacon bachelor’s Dutch-oven, I got here.’ ‘No, no!’ said Steerforth. ‘Do not ring! I cannot! I going breakfast one fellows Piazza Hotel, Covent Garden.’ ‘But you will come back dinner?’ said I. ‘I cannot, upon life. There is nothing I like better, I must remain two fellows. We three together tomorrow morning.’ ‘Then bring dinner,’ I returned. ‘Do think would come?’ ‘Oh! would come fast enough,’ said Steerforth; ‘but inconvenience you. You better come dine us somewhere.’ I would means consent this, occurred I really ought little house-warming, never could better opportunity. I new pride rooms his approval them, burned desire develop utmost resources. I therefore made promise positively names his two friends, appointed six of the clock dinner-hour. When he gone, I rang Mrs. Crupp, acquainted her desperate design. Mrs. Crupp said, first place, course well known she could not expected wait, she knew handy young man, she thought could prevailed upon it, whose terms would five shillings, I pleased. I said, certainly would him. Next Mrs. Crupp said clear she could not two places (which I felt reasonable), ‘a young gal’ stationed pantry bedroom candle, never desist washing plates, would indispensable. I said, would expense young female? Mrs. Crupp said she supposed eighteenpence would neither make break me. I said I supposed not; THAT settled. Then Mrs. Crupp said, Now dinner. It remarkable instance want forethought part ironmonger made Mrs. Crupp’s kitchen fireplace, capable cooking nothing chops mashed potatoes. As fish-kittle, Mrs. Crupp said, well! would I come look range? She could not say fairer that. Would I come look it? As I much wiser I HAD looked it, I declined, said, ‘Never mind fish.’ But Mrs. Crupp said, Do not say that; oysters in, them? So THAT settled. Mrs. Crupp said she would recommend would this. A pair hot roast fowls--from pastry-cook’s; dish stewed beef, vegetables--from pastry-cook’s; two little corner things, raised pie dish kidneys--from pastrycook’s; tart, (if I liked) shape jelly--from pastrycook’s. This, Mrs. Crupp said, would leave her full liberty concentrate her mind potatoes, serve cheese celery she could wish see done. I acted Mrs. Crupp’s opinion, gave order pastry-cook’s myself. Walking along Strand, afterwards, observing hard mottled substance window ham beef shop, resembled marble, labelled ‘Mock Turtle’, I went bought slab it, I since seen reason believe would sufficed fifteen people. This preparation, Mrs. Crupp, difficulty, consented warm up; shrunk much liquid state, found Steerforth called ‘rather tight fit’ four. These preparations happily completed, I bought little dessert Covent Garden Market, gave rather extensive order retail wine-merchant’s vicinity. When I came home afternoon, saw bottles drawn square pantry floor, looked numerous (though two missing, made Mrs. Crupp uncomfortable), I absolutely frightened them. One Steerforth’s friends named Grainger, Markham. They gay lively fellows; Grainger, something older Steerforth; Markham, youthful-looking, I say twenty. I observed latter always spoke indefinitely, ‘a man’, seldom never first person singular. ‘A man might get well here, Mr. Copperfield,’ said Markham--meaning himself. ‘It is bad situation,’ said I, ‘and rooms really commodious.’ ‘I hope brought appetites you?’ said Steerforth. ‘Upon honour,’ returned Markham, ‘town seems sharpen man’s appetite. A man hungry day long. A man perpetually eating.’ Being little embarrassed first, feeling much young preside, I made Steerforth take head table dinner announced, seated opposite him. Everything good; spare wine; he exerted brilliantly make thing pass well, pause festivity. I quite good company dinner I could wished be, chair opposite door, attention distracted observing handy young man went room often, his shadow always presented itself, immediately afterwards, wall entry, bottle mouth. The ‘young gal’ likewise occasioned uneasiness: much neglecting wash plates, breaking them. For inquisitive disposition, unable confine herself (as her positive instructions were) pantry, she constantly peering us, constantly imagining herself detected; belief, she several times retired upon plates (with she carefully paved floor), great deal destruction. These, however, small drawbacks, easily forgotten cloth cleared, dessert put table; period entertainment handy young man discovered speechless. Giving private directions seek society Mrs. Crupp, remove ‘young gal’ basement also, I abandoned enjoyment. I began, singularly cheerful light-hearted; sorts half-forgotten things talk about, came rushing mind, made hold forth unwonted manner. I laughed heartily jokes, everybody else’s; called Steerforth order passing wine; made several engagements go Oxford; announced I meant dinner-party exactly like that, week, notice; madly took much snuff Grainger’s box, I obliged go pantry, private fit sneezing ten minutes long. I went on, passing wine faster faster yet, continually starting corkscrew open wine, long needed. I proposed Steerforth’s health. I said he dearest friend, protector boyhood, companion prime. I said I delighted propose his health. I said I owed obligations I could ever repay, held higher admiration I could ever express. I finished saying, ‘I will give Steerforth! God bless him! Hurrah!’ We gave three times three, another, good one finish with. I broke glass going round table shake hands him, I said (in two words) ‘Steerforth--you’retheguidingstarofmyexistence.’ I went on, finding suddenly somebody middle song. Markham singer, he sang ‘When heart man depressed care’. He said, he sung it, he would give us ‘Woman!’ I took objection that, I could not allow it. I said respectful way proposing toast, I would never permit toast drunk house otherwise ‘The Ladies!’ I high him, mainly I think I saw Steerforth Grainger laughing me--or him--or us. He said man dictated to. I said man was. He said man insulted, then. I said he right there--never roof, Lares sacred, laws hospitality paramount. He said derogation man’s dignity confess I devilish good fellow. I instantly proposed his health. Somebody smoking. We smoking. I smoking, trying suppress rising tendency shudder. Steerforth made speech me, course I affected almost tears. I returned thanks, hoped present company would dine tomorrow, day after--each day five of the clock, might enjoy pleasures conversation society long evening. I felt called upon propose individual. I would give aunt. Miss Betsey Trotwood, best her sex! Somebody leaning bedroom window, refreshing his forehead cool stone parapet, feeling air upon his face. It myself. I addressing ‘Copperfield’, saying, ‘Why try smoke? You might known could not it.’ Now, somebody unsteadily contemplating his features looking-glass. That I too. I pale looking-glass; eyes vacant appearance; hair--only hair, nothing else--looked drunk. Somebody said me, ‘Let us go theatre, Copperfield!’ There bedroom me, jingling table covered glasses; lamp; Grainger right hand, Markham left, Steerforth opposite--all sitting mist, long way off. The theatre? To sure. The thing. Come along! But must excuse I saw everybody first, turned lamp off--in case fire. Owing confusion dark, door gone. I feeling window-curtains, Steerforth, laughing, took arm led out. We went downstairs, one behind another. Near bottom, somebody fell, rolled down. Somebody else said Copperfield. I angry false report, until, finding back passage, I began think might foundation it. A foggy night, great rings round lamps streets! There indistinct talk wet. I considered frosty. Steerforth dusted lamp-post, put hat shape, somebody produced somewhere extraordinary manner, I had not before. Steerforth said, ‘You right, Copperfield, not?’ I told him, ‘Neverberrer.’ A man, sitting pigeon-hole-place, looked fog, took money somebody, inquiring I one gentlemen paid for, appearing rather doubtful (as I remember glimpse I him) whether take money not. Shortly afterwards, high hot theatre, looking large pit, seemed smoke; people crammed indistinct. There great stage, too, looking clean smooth streets; people upon it, talking something other, intelligibly. There abundance bright lights, music, ladies boxes, I do not know more. The whole building looked learning swim; conducted unaccountable manner, I tried steady it. On somebody is motion, resolved go downstairs dress-boxes, ladies were. A gentleman lounging, full dressed, sofa, opera-glass his hand, passed view, also figure full length glass. Then I ushered one boxes, found saying something I sat down, people crying ‘Silence!’ somebody, ladies casting indignant glances me, and--what! yes!--Agnes, sitting seat me, box, lady gentleman beside her, I did not know. I see her face now, better I then, I dare say, indelible look regret wonder turned upon me. ‘Agnes!’ I said, thickly, ‘Lorblessmer! Agnes!’ ‘Hush! Pray!’ she answered, I could conceive why. ‘You disturb company. Look stage!’ I tried, her injunction, fix it, hear something going there, quite vain. I looked her by, saw her shrink her corner, put her gloved hand her forehead. ‘Agnes!’ I said. ‘I’mafraidyou’renorwell.’ ‘Yes, yes. Do mind me, Trotwood,’ she returned. ‘Listen! Are going away soon?’ ‘Amigoarawaysoo?’ I repeated. ‘Yes.’ I stupid intention replying I going wait, hand her downstairs. I suppose I expressed it, somehow; she looked attentively little while, she appeared understand, replied low tone: ‘I know I ask you, I tell I earnest it. Go away now, Trotwood, sake, ask friends take home.’ She far improved me, time, though I angry her, I felt ashamed, short ‘Goori!’ (which I intended ‘Good night!’) got went away. They followed, I stepped box-door bedroom, Steerforth me, helping undress, I turns telling Agnes sister, adjuring bring corkscrew, I might open another bottle wine. How somebody, lying bed, lay saying again, cross purposes, feverish dream night--the bed rocking sea never still! How, somebody slowly settled myself, I begin parch, feel outer covering skin hard board; tongue bottom empty kettle, furred long service, burning slow fire; palms hands, hot plates metal ice could cool! But agony mind, remorse, shame I felt I became conscious next day! My horror committed thousand offences I forgotten, nothing could ever expiate--my recollection indelible look Agnes given me--the torturing impossibility communicating her, knowing, Beast I was, she came London, she stayed--my disgust sight room revel held--my racking head--the smell smoke, sight glasses, impossibility going out, even getting up! Oh, day was! Oh, evening, I sat fire basin mutton broth, dimpled fat, thought I going way predecessor, succeed his dismal story well his chambers, half mind rush express Dover reveal all! What evening, Mrs. Crupp, coming take away broth-basin, produced one kidney cheese-plate entire remains yesterday’s feast, I really inclined fall upon her nankeen breast say, heartfelt penitence, ‘Oh, Mrs. Crupp, Mrs. Crupp, never mind broken meats! I miserable!’--only I doubted, even pass, Mrs. Crupp quite sort woman confide in! CHAPTER 25. GOOD AND BAD ANGELS I going door morning deplorable day headache, sickness, repentance, odd confusion mind relative date dinner-party, body Titans taken enormous lever pushed day yesterday months back, I saw ticket-porter coming upstairs, letter his hand. He taking his time his errand, then; he saw top staircase, looking banisters, he swung trot, came panting he run state exhaustion. ‘T. Copperfield, Esquire,’ said ticket-porter, touching his hat his little cane. I could scarcely lay claim name: I disturbed conviction letter came Agnes. However, I told I T. Copperfield, Esquire, he believed it, gave letter, he said required answer. I shut landing wait answer, went chambers again, nervous state I fain lay letter breakfast table, familiarize outside little, I could resolve break seal. I found, I open it, kind note, containing reference condition theatre. All said was, ‘My dear Trotwood. I staying house papa’s agent, Mr. Waterbrook, Ely Place, Holborn. Will come see today, time like appoint? Ever affectionately, AGNES.’ It took long time write answer satisfaction, I do not know ticket-porter thought, unless he thought I learning write. I must written half-a-dozen answers least. I began one, ‘How I ever hope, dear Agnes, efface remembrance disgusting impression’--there I did not like it, I tore up. I began another, ‘Shakespeare observed, dear Agnes, strange man put enemy his mouth’--that reminded Markham, got farther. I even tried poetry. I began one note, six-syllable line, ‘Oh, remember’--but associated fifth November, became absurdity. After many attempts, I wrote, ‘My dear Agnes. Your letter like you, could I say would higher praise that? I come four of the clock. Affectionately sorrowfully, T.C.’ With missive (which I twenty minds recalling, soon hands), ticket-porter last departed. If day half tremendous professional gentleman Doctors’ Commons me, I sincerely believe he made expiation his share rotten old ecclesiastical cheese. Although I left office half past three, prowling place appointment within minutes afterwards, appointed time exceeded full quarter hour, according clock St. Andrew’s, Holborn, I could muster sufficient desperation pull private bell-handle let left-hand door-post Mr. Waterbrook’s house. The professional business Mr. Waterbrook’s establishment done ground-floor, genteel business (of good deal) upper part building. I shown pretty rather close drawing-room, sat Agnes, netting purse. She looked quiet good, reminded strongly airy fresh school days Canterbury, sodden, smoky, stupid wretch I night, that, nobody by, I yielded self-reproach shame, and--in short, made fool myself. I cannot deny I she would tears. To hour I undecided whether upon whole wisest thing I could done, ridiculous. ‘If anyone you, Agnes,’ said I, turning away head, ‘I minded half much. But saw me! I almost wish I dead, first.’ She put her hand--its touch like hand--upon arm moment; I felt befriended comforted, I could help moving lips, gratefully kissing it. ‘Sit down,’ said Agnes, cheerfully. ‘Do not unhappy, Trotwood. If cannot confidently trust me, trust?’ ‘Ah, Agnes!’ I returned. ‘You good Angel!’ She smiled rather sadly, I thought, shook her head. ‘Yes, Agnes, good Angel! Always good Angel!’ ‘If I were, indeed, Trotwood,’ she returned, ‘there one thing I set heart much.’ I looked her inquiringly; already foreknowledge her meaning. ‘On warning you,’ said Agnes, steady glance, ‘against bad Angel.’ ‘My dear Agnes,’ I began, ‘if mean Steerforth--’ ‘I do, Trotwood,’ she returned. ‘Then, Agnes, wrong much. He bad Angel, anyone’s! He, anything guide, support, friend me! My dear Agnes! Now, unjust, unlike you, judge saw night?’ ‘I judge I saw night,’ she quietly replied. ‘From what, then?’ ‘From many things--trifles themselves, seem so, put together. I judge him, partly account him, Trotwood, character, influence he you.’ There always something her modest voice seemed touch chord within me, answering sound alone. It always earnest; earnest, now, thrill quite subdued me. I sat looking her she cast her eyes her work; I sat seeming still listen her; Steerforth, spite attachment him, darkened tone. ‘It bold me,’ said Agnes, looking again, ‘who lived seclusion, know little world, give advice confidently, even strong opinion. But I know engendered, Trotwood,--in true remembrance grown together, true interest relating you. It makes bold. I certain I say right. I quite sure is. I feel someone else speaking you, I, I caution made dangerous friend.’ Again I looked her, I listened her she silent, his image, though still fixed heart, darkened. ‘I unreasonable expect,’ said Agnes, resuming her usual tone, little while, ‘that will, can, once, change sentiment become conviction you; least sentiment rooted trusting disposition. You ought hastily that. I ask you, Trotwood, ever think me--I mean,’ quiet smile, I going interrupt her, she knew why, ‘as often think me--to think I said. Do forgive this?’ ‘I forgive you, Agnes,’ I replied, ‘when come Steerforth justice, like well I do.’ ‘Not then?’ said Agnes. I saw passing shadow her face I made mention him, she returned smile, unreserved mutual confidence old. ‘And when, Agnes,’ said I, ‘will forgive night?’ ‘When I recall it,’ said Agnes. She would dismissed subject so, I full allow that, insisted telling her happened I disgraced myself, chain accidental circumstances theatre final link. It great relief this, enlarge obligation I owed Steerforth his care I unable take care myself. ‘You must forget,’ said Agnes, calmly changing conversation soon I concluded, ‘that always tell me, fall trouble, fall love. Who succeeded Miss Larkins, Trotwood?’ ‘No one, Agnes.’ ‘Someone, Trotwood,’ said Agnes, laughing, holding her finger. ‘No, Agnes, upon word! There lady, certainly, Mrs. Steerforth’s house, clever, I like talk to--Miss Dartle--but I do not adore her.’ Agnes laughed her penetration, told I faithful her confidence she thought she keep little register violent attachments, date, duration, termination each, like table reigns kings queens, History England. Then she asked I seen Uriah. ‘Uriah Heep?’ said I. ‘No. Is he London?’ ‘He comes office downstairs, every day,’ returned Agnes. ‘He London week me. I afraid disagreeable business, Trotwood.’ ‘On business makes uneasy, Agnes, I see,’ said I. ‘What be?’ Agnes laid aside her work, replied, folding her hands upon one another, looking pensively beautiful soft eyes hers: ‘I believe he going enter partnership papa.’ ‘What? Uriah? That mean, fawning fellow, worm promotion!’ I cried, indignantly. ‘Have made remonstrance it, Agnes? Consider connexion likely be. You must speak out. You must allow father take mad step. You must prevent it, Agnes, there is time.’ Still looking me, Agnes shook her head I speaking, faint smile warmth: replied: ‘You remember last conversation papa? It long that--not two three days--when he gave first intimation I tell you. It sad see struggling his desire represent matter choice his part, his inability conceal forced upon him. I felt sorry.’ ‘Forced upon him, Agnes! Who forces upon him?’ ‘Uriah,’ she replied, moment’s hesitation, ‘has made indispensable papa. He subtle watchful. He mastered papa’s weaknesses, fostered them, taken advantage them, until--to say I mean word, Trotwood,--until papa afraid him.’ There she might said; she knew, she suspected; I clearly saw. I could give her pain asking was, I knew she withheld me, spare her father. It long going this, I sensible: yes, I could feel, least reflection, going long time. I remained silent. ‘His ascendancy papa,’ said Agnes, ‘is great. He professes humility gratitude--with truth, perhaps: I hope so--but his position really one power, I fear he makes hard use his power.’ I said he hound, which, moment, great satisfaction me. ‘At time I speak of, time papa spoke me,’ pursued Agnes, ‘he told papa he going away; he sorry, unwilling leave, he better prospects. Papa much depressed then, bowed care ever I seen him; he seemed relieved expedient partnership, though time he seemed hurt ashamed it.’ ‘And receive it, Agnes?’ ‘I did, Trotwood,’ she replied, ‘what I hope right. Feeling sure necessary papa’s peace sacrifice made, I entreated make it. I said would lighten load his life--I hope will!--and would give increased opportunities his companion. Oh, Trotwood!’ cried Agnes, putting her hands her face, her tears started it, ‘I almost feel I papa’s enemy, instead his loving child. For I know he altered, his devotion me. I know he narrowed circle his sympathies duties, concentration his whole mind upon me. I know multitude things he shut sake, his anxious thoughts shadowed his life, weakened his strength energy, turning always upon one idea. If I could ever set right! If I could ever work his restoration, I innocently his decline!’ I never seen Agnes cry. I seen tears her eyes I brought new honours home school, I seen last spoke her father, I seen her turn her gentle head aside took leave one another; I never seen her grieve like this. It made sorry I could say, foolish, helpless manner, ‘Pray, Agnes, do not! Do not, dear sister!’ But Agnes superior character purpose, I know well now, whatever I might know know then, long need entreaties. The beautiful, calm manner, makes her different remembrance everybody else, came back again, cloud passed serene sky. ‘We likely remain alone much longer,’ said Agnes, ‘and I opportunity, let earnestly entreat you, Trotwood, friendly Uriah. Do not repel him. Do not resent (as I think general disposition do) may uncongenial him. He may deserve it, know certain ill him. In case, think first papa me!’ Agnes time say more, room door opened, Mrs. Waterbrook, large lady--or wore large dress: I do not exactly know which, I do not know dress lady--came sailing in. I dim recollection seen her theatre, I seen her pale magic lantern; she appeared remember perfectly, still suspect state intoxication. Finding degrees, however, I sober, (I hope) I modest young gentleman, Mrs. Waterbrook softened towards considerably, inquired, firstly, I went much parks, secondly, I went much society. On replying questions negative, occurred I fell her good opinion; she concealed fact gracefully, invited dinner next day. I accepted invitation, took leave, making call Uriah office I went out, leaving card his absence. When I went dinner next day, street door opened, plunged vapour-bath haunch mutton, I divined I guest, I immediately identified ticket-porter disguise, assisting family servant, waiting foot stairs carry name. He looked, best his ability, he asked confidentially, he never seen before; well I know him, well he know me. Conscience made cowards us both. I found Mr. Waterbrook middle-aged gentleman, short throat, good deal shirt-collar, wanted black nose portrait pug-dog. He told he happy honour making acquaintance; I paid homage Mrs. Waterbrook, presented me, much ceremony, awful lady black velvet dress, great black velvet hat, I remember looking like near relation Hamlet’s--say his aunt. Mrs. Henry Spiker lady’s name; her husband too: cold man, his head, instead grey, seemed sprinkled hoar-frost. Immense deference shown Henry Spikers, male female; Agnes told account Mr. Henry Spiker solicitor something somebody, I forget which, remotely connected Treasury. I found Uriah Heep among company, suit black, deep humility. He told me, I shook hands him, he proud noticed me, he really felt obliged condescension. I could wished he less obliged me, he hovered his gratitude rest evening; whenever I said word Agnes, sure, his shadowless eyes cadaverous face, looking gauntly upon us behind. There guests--all iced occasion, struck me, like wine. But one attracted attention he came in, account hearing announced Mr. Traddles! My mind flew back Salem House; could Tommy, I thought, used draw skeletons! I looked Mr. Traddles unusual interest. He sober, steady-looking young man retiring manners, comic head hair, eyes rather wide open; he got obscure corner soon, I difficulty making out. At length I good view him, either vision deceived me, old unfortunate Tommy. I made way Mr. Waterbrook, said, I believed I pleasure seeing old schoolfellow there. ‘Indeed!’ said Mr. Waterbrook, surprised. ‘You young school Mr. Henry Spiker?’ ‘Oh, I do not mean him!’ I returned. ‘I mean gentleman named Traddles.’ ‘Oh! Aye, aye! Indeed!’ said host, much diminished interest. ‘Possibly.’ ‘If it is really person,’ said I, glancing towards him, ‘it place called Salem House together, he excellent fellow.’ ‘Oh yes. Traddles good fellow,’ returned host nodding his head air toleration. ‘Traddles quite good fellow.’ ‘It is curious coincidence,’ said I. ‘It really,’ returned host, ‘quite coincidence, Traddles all: Traddles invited morning, place table, intended occupied Mrs. Henry Spiker’s brother, became vacant, consequence his indisposition. A gentlemanly man, Mrs. Henry Spiker’s brother, Mr. Copperfield.’ I murmured assent, full feeling, considering I knew nothing him; I inquired Mr. Traddles profession. ‘Traddles,’ returned Mr. Waterbrook, ‘is young man reading bar. Yes. He quite good fellow--nobody’s enemy his own.’ ‘Is he his enemy?’ said I, sorry hear this. ‘Well,’ returned Mr. Waterbrook, pursing his mouth, playing his watch-chain, comfortable, prosperous sort way. ‘I say he one men stand light. Yes, I say he would never, example, worth five hundred pound. Traddles recommended professional friend. Oh yes. Yes. He kind talent drawing briefs, stating case writing, plainly. I able throw something Traddles’s way, course year; something--for him--considerable. Oh yes. Yes.’ I much impressed extremely comfortable satisfied manner Mr. Waterbrook delivered little word ‘Yes’, every then. There wonderful expression it. It completely conveyed idea man born, say silver spoon, scaling-ladder, gone mounting heights life one another, he looked, top fortifications, eye philosopher patron, people trenches. My reflections theme still progress dinner announced. Mr. Waterbrook went Hamlet’s aunt. Mr. Henry Spiker took Mrs. Waterbrook. Agnes, I liked take myself, given simpering fellow weak legs. Uriah, Traddles, I, junior part company, went last, could. I vexed losing Agnes I might been, since gave opportunity making known Traddles stairs, greeted great fervour; Uriah writhed obtrusive satisfaction self-abasement, I could gladly pitched banisters. Traddles I separated table, billeted two remote corners: he glare red velvet lady; I, gloom Hamlet’s aunt. The dinner long, conversation Aristocracy--and Blood. Mrs. Waterbrook repeatedly told us, she weakness, Blood. It occurred several times got better, quite genteel. We exceedingly genteel, scope limited. A Mr. Mrs. Gulpidge party, something second-hand (at least, Mr. Gulpidge had) law business Bank; Bank, Treasury, exclusive Court Circular. To mend matter, Hamlet’s aunt family failing indulging soliloquy, held forth desultory manner, herself, every topic introduced. These enough, sure; always fell back upon Blood, she wide field abstract speculation her nephew himself. We might party Ogres, conversation assumed sanguine complexion. ‘I confess I Mrs. Waterbrook’s opinion,’ said Mr. Waterbrook, his wine-glass his eye. ‘Other things well way, give Blood!’ ‘Oh! There nothing,’ observed Hamlet’s aunt, ‘so satisfactory one! There nothing much one’s beau-ideal of--of sort thing, speaking generally. There low minds (not many, I happy believe, some) would prefer I call bow idols. Positively Idols! Before service, intellect, on. But intangible points. Blood so. We see Blood nose, know it. We meet chin, say, “There is! That is Blood!” It actual matter fact. We point out. It admits doubt.’ The simpering fellow weak legs, taken Agnes down, stated question decisively yet, I thought. ‘Oh, know, deuce take it,’ said gentleman, looking round board imbecile smile, ‘we cannot forego Blood, know. We must Blood, know. Some young fellows, know, may little behind station, perhaps, point education behaviour, may go little wrong, know, get people variety fixes--and that--but deuce take it, it is delightful reflect they have got Blood ‘them! Myself, I would rather time knocked man got Blood him, I would picked man had not!’ This sentiment, compressing general question nutshell, gave utmost satisfaction, brought gentleman great notice ladies retired. After that, I observed Mr. Gulpidge Mr. Henry Spiker, hitherto distant, entered defensive alliance us, common enemy, exchanged mysterious dialogue across table defeat overthrow. ‘That affair first bond four thousand five hundred pounds taken course expected, Spiker,’ said Mr. Gulpidge. ‘Do mean D. A.’s?’ said Mr. Spiker. ‘The C. B.’s!’ said Mr. Gulpidge. Mr. Spiker raised his eyebrows, looked much concerned. ‘When question referred Lord--I need not name him,’ said Mr. Gulpidge, checking himself-- ‘I understand,’ said Mr. Spiker, ‘N.’ Mr. Gulpidge darkly nodded--‘was referred him, his answer was, “Money, release.”’ ‘Lord bless soul!’ cried Mr. Spiker. “‘Money, release,”’ repeated Mr. Gulpidge, firmly. ‘The next reversion--you understand me?’ ‘K.,’ said Mr. Spiker, ominous look. ‘--K. positively refused sign. He attended Newmarket purpose, he point-blank refused it.’ Mr. Spiker interested, he became quite stony. ‘So matter rests hour,’ said Mr. Gulpidge, throwing back his chair. ‘Our friend Waterbrook excuse I forbear explain generally, account magnitude interests involved.’ Mr. Waterbrook happy, appeared me, interests, names, even hinted at, across his table. He assumed expression gloomy intelligence (though I persuaded he knew discussion I did), highly approved discretion observed. Mr. Spiker, receipt confidence, naturally desired favour his friend confidence his own; therefore foregoing dialogue succeeded another, Mr. Gulpidge’s turn surprised, another surprise came round Mr. Spiker’s turn again, on, turn turn about. All time we, outsiders, remained oppressed tremendous interests involved conversation; host regarded us pride, victims salutary awe astonishment. I glad indeed get upstairs Agnes, talk her corner, introduce Traddles her, shy, agreeable, good-natured creature still. As he obliged leave early, account going away next morning month, I nearly much conversation I could wished; exchanged addresses, promised pleasure another meeting he come back town. He greatly interested hear I knew Steerforth, spoke warmth I made tell Agnes he thought him. But Agnes looked while, slightly shook her head I observed her. As she among people I believed she could much home, I almost glad hear she going away within days, though I sorry prospect parting her soon. This caused remain company gone. Conversing her, hearing her sing, delightful reminder happy life grave old house she made beautiful, I could remained half night; but, excuse staying longer, lights Mr. Waterbrook’s society snuffed out, I took leave much inclination. I felt then, ever, she better Angel; I thought her sweet face placid smile, though shone removed being, like Angel, I hope I thought harm. I said company gone; I ought excepted Uriah, I do not include denomination, never ceased hover near us. He close behind I went downstairs. He close beside me, I walked away house, slowly fitting his long skeleton fingers still longer fingers great Guy Fawkes pair gloves. It disposition Uriah’s company, remembrance entreaty Agnes made me, I asked he would come home rooms, coffee. ‘Oh, really, Master Copperfield,’ he rejoined--‘I beg pardon, Mister Copperfield, comes natural, I do not like put constraint upon ask numble person like ouse.’ ‘There constraint case,’ said I. ‘Will come?’ ‘I like to, much,’ replied Uriah, writhe. ‘Well, then, come along!’ said I. I could help rather short him, he appeared mind it. We went nearest way, without conversing much upon road; he humble respect scarecrow gloves, he still putting on, seemed made advance labour, got place. I led dark stairs, prevent his knocking his head anything, really his damp cold hand felt like frog mine, I tempted drop run away. Agnes hospitality prevailed, however, I conducted fireside. When I lighted candles, he fell meek transports room revealed him; I heated coffee unassuming block-tin vessel Mrs. Crupp delighted prepare (chiefly, I believe, intended purpose, shaving-pot, patent invention great price mouldering away pantry), he professed much emotion, I could joyfully scalded him. ‘Oh, really, Master Copperfield,--I mean Mister Copperfield,’ said Uriah, ‘to see waiting upon I never could expected! But, one way another, many things happen I never could expected, I sure, umble station, seems rain blessings ed. You heard something, I des-say, change expectations, Master Copperfield,--I say, Mister Copperfield?’ As he sat sofa, his long knees drawn his coffee-cup, his hat gloves upon ground close him, his spoon going softly round round, his shadowless red eyes, looked scorched lashes off, turned towards without looking me, disagreeable dints I formerly described his nostrils coming going his breath, snaky undulation pervading his frame his chin his boots, I decided mind I disliked intensely. It made uncomfortable guest, I young then, unused disguise I strongly felt. ‘You heard something, I des-say, change expectations, Master Copperfield,--I say, Mister Copperfield?’ observed Uriah. ‘Yes,’ said I, ‘something.’ ‘Ah! I thought Miss Agnes would know it!’ he quietly returned. ‘I am glad find Miss Agnes knows it. Oh, thank you, Master--Mister Copperfield!’ I could thrown bootjack (it lay ready rug), entrapped disclosure anything concerning Agnes, however immaterial. But I drank coffee. ‘What prophet shown yourself, Mister Copperfield!’ pursued Uriah. ‘Dear me, prophet proved be! Do not remember saying once, perhaps I partner Mr. Wickfield’s business, perhaps might Wickfield Heep? You may recollect it; person umble, Master Copperfield, person treasures things up!’ ‘I recollect talking it,’ said I, ‘though I certainly think likely then.’ ‘Oh! would thought likely, Mister Copperfield!’ returned Uriah, enthusiastically. ‘I sure I did not myself. I recollect saying lips I much umble. So I considered really truly.’ He sat, carved grin his face, looking fire, I looked him. ‘But umblest persons, Master Copperfield,’ he presently resumed, ‘may instruments good. I glad think I instrument good Mr. Wickfield, I may so. Oh worthy man he is, Mister Copperfield, imprudent he been!’ ‘I sorry hear it,’ said I. I could help adding, rather pointedly, ‘on accounts.’ ‘Decidedly so, Mister Copperfield,’ replied Uriah. ‘On accounts. Miss Agnes’s all! You do not remember eloquent expressions, Master Copperfield; I remember said one day everybody must admire her, I thanked it! You forgot that, I doubt, Master Copperfield?’ ‘No,’ said I, drily. ‘Oh glad I not!’ exclaimed Uriah. ‘To think first kindle sparks ambition umble breast, you have forgot it! Oh!--Would excuse asking cup coffee?’ Something emphasis he laid upon kindling sparks, something glance he directed he said it, made start I seen illuminated blaze light. Recalled his request, preferred quite another tone voice, I honours shaving-pot; I unsteadiness hand, sudden sense match him, perplexed suspicious anxiety he might going say next, I felt could escape his observation. He said nothing all. He stirred his coffee round round, he sipped it, he felt his chin softly his grisly hand, he looked fire, he looked room, he gasped rather smiled me, he writhed undulated about, his deferential servility, he stirred sipped again, he left renewal conversation me. ‘So, Mr. Wickfield,’ said I, last, ‘who worth five hundred you--or me’; life, I think, I could helped dividing part sentence awkward jerk; ‘has imprudent, he, Mr. Heep?’ ‘Oh, imprudent indeed, Master Copperfield,’ returned Uriah, sighing modestly. ‘Oh, much so! But I wish you would call Uriah, please. It is like old times.’ ‘Well! Uriah,’ said I, bolting difficulty. ‘Thank you,’ he returned, fervour. ‘Thank you, Master Copperfield! It is like blowing old breezes ringing old bellses hear YOU say Uriah. I beg pardon. Was I making observation?’ ‘About Mr. Wickfield,’ I suggested. ‘Oh! Yes, truly,’ said Uriah. ‘Ah! Great imprudence, Master Copperfield. It is topic I would not touch upon, soul you. Even I touch upon it, more. If anyone else place last years, time he would Mr. Wickfield (oh, worthy man he is, Master Copperfield, too!) his thumb. Un--der--his thumb,’ said Uriah, slowly, he stretched his cruel-looking hand table, pressed his thumb upon it, shook, shook room. If I obliged look splay foot Mr. Wickfield’s head, I think I could scarcely hated more. ‘Oh, dear, yes, Master Copperfield,’ he proceeded, soft voice, remarkably contrasting action his thumb, diminish hard pressure least degree, ‘there is doubt it. There would loss, disgrace, I do not know all. Mr. Wickfield knows it. I umble instrument umbly serving him, he puts eminence I hardly could hoped reach. How thankful I be!’ With his face turned towards me, he finished, without looking me, he took his crooked thumb spot he planted it, slowly thoughtfully scraped his lank jaw it, he shaving himself. I recollect well indignantly heart beat, I saw his crafty face, appropriately red light fire upon it, preparing something else. ‘Master Copperfield,’ he began--‘but I keeping up?’ ‘You keeping up. I generally go bed late.’ ‘Thank you, Master Copperfield! I risen umble station since first used address me, true; I umble still. I hope I never shall otherwise umble. You think worse umbleness, I make little confidence you, Master Copperfield? Will you?’ ‘Oh no,’ said I, effort. ‘Thank you!’ He took his pocket-handkerchief, began wiping palms his hands. ‘Miss Agnes, Master Copperfield--’ ‘Well, Uriah?’ ‘Oh, pleasant called Uriah, spontaneously!’ he cried; gave jerk, like convulsive fish. ‘You thought her looking beautiful tonight, Master Copperfield?’ ‘I thought her looking she always does: superior, respects, everyone around her,’ I returned. ‘Oh, thank you! It is true!’ he cried. ‘Oh, thank much that!’ ‘Not all,’ I said, loftily. ‘There reason thank me.’ ‘Why that, Master Copperfield,’ said Uriah, ‘is, fact, confidence I going take liberty reposing. Umble I am,’ he wiped his hands harder, looked fire turns, ‘umble mother is, lowly poor honest roof ever been, image Miss Agnes (I do not mind trusting secret, Master Copperfield, I always overflowed towards since first moment I pleasure beholding pony-shay) breast years. Oh, Master Copperfield, pure affection I love ground Agnes walks on!’ I believe I delirious idea seizing red-hot poker fire, running it. It went shock, like ball fired rifle: image Agnes, outraged much thought red-headed animal’s, remained mind I looked him, sitting awry his mean soul griped his body, made giddy. He seemed swell grow eyes; room seemed full echoes his voice; strange feeling (to which, perhaps, one quite stranger) occurred before, indefinite time, I knew he going say next, took possession me. A timely observation sense power his face, bring back remembrance entreaty Agnes, full force, effort I could made. I asked him, better appearance composure I could thought possible minute before, whether he made his feelings known Agnes. ‘Oh no, Master Copperfield!’ he returned; ‘oh dear, no! Not anyone you. You see I emerging lowly station. I rest good deal hope her observing useful I her father (for I trust useful indeed, Master Copperfield), I smooth way him, keep straight. She is much attached her father, Master Copperfield (oh, lovely thing daughter!), I think she may come, his account, kind me.’ I fathomed depth rascal’s whole scheme, understood he laid bare. ‘If you will goodness keep secret, Master Copperfield,’ he pursued, ‘and not, general, go me, I shall take particular favour. You would not wish make unpleasantness. I know friendly heart you have got; known umble footing (on umblest I say, I umble still), might, unbeknown, go rather, Agnes. I call her mine, see, Master Copperfield. There is song says, “I would crowns resign, call her mine!” I hope it, one days.’ Dear Agnes! So much loving good anyone I could think of, possible she reserved wife wretch this! ‘There is hurry present, know, Master Copperfield,’ Uriah proceeded, his slimy way, I sat gazing him, thought mind. ‘My Agnes young still; mother work way upwards, make good many new arrangements, would quite convenient. So I shall time gradually make her familiar hopes, opportunities offer. Oh, I am much obliged confidence! Oh, it is relief, cannot think, know understand situation, certain (as would not wish make unpleasantness family) go me!’ He took hand I dared withhold, given damp squeeze, referred his pale-faced watch. ‘Dear me!’ he said, ‘it is past one. The moments slip away so, confidence old times, Master Copperfield, it is almost half past one!’ I answered I thought later. Not I really thought so, conversational powers effectually scattered. ‘Dear me!’ he said, considering. ‘The ouse I stopping at--a sort private hotel boarding ouse, Master Copperfield, near New River ed--will gone bed two hours.’ ‘I sorry,’ I returned, ‘that one bed here, I--’ ‘Oh, do not think mentioning beds, Master Copperfield!’ he rejoined ecstatically, drawing one leg. ‘But would objections laying fire?’ ‘If comes that,’ I said, ‘pray take bed, I will lie fire.’ His repudiation offer almost shrill enough, excess surprise humility, penetrated ears Mrs. Crupp, sleeping, I suppose, distant chamber, situated level low-water mark, soothed her slumbers ticking incorrigible clock, she always referred little difference score punctuality, never less three-quarters hour slow, always put right morning best authorities. As arguments I could urge, bewildered condition, least effect upon his modesty inducing accept bedroom, I obliged make best arrangements I could, his repose fire. The mattress sofa (which great deal short his lank figure), sofa pillows, blanket, table-cover, clean breakfast-cloth, great-coat, made bed covering, he thankful. Having lent night-cap, he put once, he made awful figure, I never worn one since, I left his rest. I never shall forget night. I never shall forget I turned tumbled; I wearied thinking Agnes creature; I considered could I do, ought I do; I could come conclusion best course her peace nothing, keep I heard. If I went sleep moments, image Agnes her tender eyes, her father looking fondly her, I often seen look, arose appealing faces, filled vague terrors. When I awoke, recollection Uriah lying next room, sat heavy like waking nightmare; oppressed leaden dread, I meaner quality devil lodger. The poker got dozing thoughts besides, would not come out. I thought, sleeping waking, still red hot, I snatched fire, run body. I haunted last idea, though I knew nothing it, I stole next room look him. There I saw him, lying his back, his legs extending I do not know where, gurglings taking place his throat, stoppages his nose, his mouth open like post-office. He much worse reality distempered fancy, afterwards I attracted repulsion, could help wandering every half-hour so, taking another look him. Still, long, long night seemed heavy hopeless ever, promise day murky sky. When I saw going downstairs early morning (for, thank Heaven! he would stay breakfast), appeared night going away his person. When I went Commons, I charged Mrs. Crupp particular directions leave windows open, sitting-room might aired, purged his presence. CHAPTER 26. I FALL INTO CAPTIVITY I saw Uriah Heep, day Agnes left town. I coach office take leave her see her go; he, returning Canterbury conveyance. It small satisfaction observe his spare, short-waisted, high-shouldered, mulberry-coloured great-coat perched up, company umbrella like small tent, edge back seat roof, Agnes was, course, inside; I underwent efforts friendly him, Agnes looked on, perhaps deserved little recompense. At coach window, dinner-party, he hovered us without moment’s intermission, like great vulture: gorging every syllable I said Agnes, Agnes said me. In state trouble his disclosure fire thrown me, I thought much words Agnes used reference partnership. ‘I I hope right. Feeling sure necessary papa’s peace sacrifice made, I entreated make it.’ A miserable foreboding she would yield to, sustain herself by, feeling reference sacrifice his sake, oppressed ever since. I knew she loved him. I knew devotion her nature was. I knew her lips she regarded herself innocent his errors, owing great debt she ardently desired pay. I consolation seeing different she detestable Rufus mulberry-coloured great-coat, I felt difference them, self-denial her pure soul sordid baseness his, greatest danger lay. All this, doubtless, he knew thoroughly, had, his cunning, considered well. Yet I certain prospect sacrifice afar off, must destroy happiness Agnes; I sure, her manner, unseen her then, cast shadow her yet; I could soon injured her, given her warning impended. Thus parted without explanation: she waving her hand smiling farewell coach window; her evil genius writhing roof, he her his clutches triumphed. I could get farewell glimpse long time. When Agnes wrote tell her safe arrival, I miserable I saw her going away. Whenever I fell thoughtful state, subject sure present itself, uneasiness sure redoubled. Hardly night passed without dreaming it. It became part life, inseparable life head. I ample leisure refine upon uneasiness: Steerforth Oxford, he wrote me, I Commons, I much alone. I believe I time lurking distrust Steerforth. I wrote affectionately reply his, I think I glad, upon whole, he could come London then. I suspect truth be, influence Agnes upon me, undisturbed sight him; powerful me, she large share thoughts interest. In meantime, days weeks slipped away. I articled Spenlow Jorkins. I ninety pounds year (exclusive house-rent sundry collateral matters) aunt. My rooms engaged twelve months certain: though I still found dreary evening, evenings long, I could settle state equable low spirits, resign coffee; I seem, looking back, taken gallon period existence. At time, too, I made three discoveries: first, Mrs. Crupp martyr curious disorder called ‘the spazzums’, generally accompanied inflammation nose, required constantly treated peppermint; secondly, something peculiar temperature pantry, made brandy-bottles burst; thirdly, I alone world, much given record circumstance fragments English versification. On day I articled, festivity took place, beyond sandwiches sherry office clerks, going alone theatre night. I went see The Stranger, Doctors’ Commons sort play, dreadfully cut up, I hardly knew glass I got home. Mr. Spenlow remarked, occasion, concluded business, he happy seen his house Norwood celebrate becoming connected, his domestic arrangements disorder, account expected return his daughter finishing her education Paris. But, he intimated she came home he hope pleasure entertaining me. I knew he widower one daughter, expressed acknowledgements. Mr. Spenlow good his word. In week two, he referred engagement, said, I would favour come next Saturday, stay till Monday, he would extremely happy. Of course I said I would favour; he drive his phaeton, bring back. When day arrived, carpet-bag object veneration stipendiary clerks, house Norwood sacred mystery. One informed he heard Mr. Spenlow ate entirely plate china; another hinted champagne constantly draught, usual custom table-beer. The old clerk wig, whose name Mr. Tiffey, business several times course his career, occasion penetrated breakfast-parlour. He described apartment sumptuous nature, said he drunk brown East India sherry there, quality precious make man wink. We adjourned Consistory day--about excommunicating baker objecting vestry paving-rate--and evidence twice length Robinson Crusoe, according calculation I made, rather late day finished. However, got excommunicated six weeks, sentenced end costs; baker’s proctor, judge, advocates sides (who nearly related), went town together, Mr. Spenlow I drove away phaeton. The phaeton handsome affair; horses arched necks lifted legs knew belonged Doctors’ Commons. There good deal competition Commons points display, turned choice equipages then; though I always considered, always shall consider, time great article competition starch: I think worn among proctors great extent nature man bear. We pleasant, going down, Mr. Spenlow gave hints reference profession. He said genteelest profession world, must account confounded profession solicitor: quite another sort thing, infinitely exclusive, less mechanical, profitable. We took things much easily Commons could taken anywhere else, he observed, set us, privileged class, apart. He said impossible conceal disagreeable fact, chiefly employed solicitors; he gave understand inferior race men, universally looked upon proctors pretensions. I asked Mr. Spenlow he considered best sort professional business? He replied, good case disputed will, neat little estate thirty forty thousand pounds, was, perhaps, best all. In case, he said, pretty pickings, way arguments every stage proceedings, mountains upon mountains evidence interrogatory counter-interrogatory (to say nothing appeal lying, first Delegates, Lords), but, costs pretty sure come estate last, sides went lively spirited manner, expense consideration. Then, he launched general eulogium Commons. What particularly admired (he said) Commons, compactness. It conveniently organized place world. It complete idea snugness. It lay nutshell. For example: You brought divorce case, restitution case, Consistory. Very good. You tried Consistory. You made quiet little round game it, among family group, played leisure. Suppose satisfied Consistory, then? Why, went Arches. What Arches? The court, room, bar, practitioners, another judge, Consistory judge could plead court-day advocate. Well, played round game again. Still satisfied. Very good. What then? Why, went Delegates. Who Delegates? Why, Ecclesiastical Delegates advocates without business, looked round game playing courts, seen cards shuffled, cut, played, talked players it, came fresh, judges, settle matter satisfaction everybody! Discontented people might talk corruption Commons, closeness Commons, necessity reforming Commons, said Mr. Spenlow solemnly, conclusion; price wheat per bushel highest, Commons busiest; man might lay his hand upon his heart, say whole world,--‘Touch Commons, comes country!’ I listened attention; though, I must say, I doubts whether country quite much obliged Commons Mr. Spenlow made out, I respectfully deferred his opinion. That price wheat per bushel, I modestly felt much strength, quite settled question. I never, hour, got better bushel wheat. It reappeared annihilate me, life, connexion kinds subjects. I do not know now, exactly, me, right crush me, infinite variety occasions; whenever I see old friend bushel brought head shoulders (as he always is, I observe), I give subject lost. This digression. I man touch Commons, bring country. I submissively expressed, silence, acquiescence I heard superior years knowledge; talked The Stranger Drama, pairs horses, came Mr. Spenlow’s gate. There lovely garden Mr. Spenlow’s house; though best time year seeing garden, beautifully kept, I quite enchanted. There charming lawn, clusters trees, perspective walks I could distinguish dark, arched trellis-work, shrubs flowers grew growing season. ‘Here Miss Spenlow walks herself,’ I thought. ‘Dear me!’ We went house, cheerfully lighted up, hall sorts hats, caps, great-coats, plaids, gloves, whips, walking-sticks. ‘Where Miss Dora?’ said Mr. Spenlow servant. ‘Dora!’ I thought. ‘What beautiful name!’ We turned room near hand (I think identical breakfast-room, made memorable brown East Indian sherry), I heard voice say, ‘Mr. Copperfield, daughter Dora, daughter Dora’s confidential friend!’ It was, doubt, Mr. Spenlow’s voice, I did not know it, I did not care whose was. All moment. I fulfilled destiny. I captive slave. I loved Dora Spenlow distraction! She human me. She Fairy, Sylph, I do not know she was--anything one ever saw, everything everybody ever wanted. I swallowed abyss love instant. There pausing brink; looking down, looking back; I gone, headlong, I sense say word her. ‘I,’ observed well-remembered voice, I bowed murmured something, ‘have seen Mr. Copperfield before.’ The speaker Dora. No; confidential friend, Miss Murdstone! I do not think I much astonished. To best judgement, capacity astonishment left me. There nothing worth mentioning material world, Dora Spenlow, astonished about. I said, ‘How do, Miss Murdstone? I hope well.’ She answered, ‘Very well.’ I said, ‘How Mr. Murdstone?’ She replied, ‘My brother robust, I obliged you.’ Mr. Spenlow, who, I suppose, surprised see us recognize other, put his word. ‘I glad find,’ he said, ‘Copperfield, Miss Murdstone already acquainted.’ ‘Mr. Copperfield myself,’ said Miss Murdstone, severe composure, ‘are connexions. We slightly acquainted. It his childish days. Circumstances separated us since. I known him.’ I replied I known her, anywhere. Which true enough. ‘Miss Murdstone goodness,’ said Mr. Spenlow me, ‘to accept office--if I may describe it--of daughter Dora’s confidential friend. My daughter Dora having, unhappily, mother, Miss Murdstone obliging enough become her companion protector.’ A passing thought occurred Miss Murdstone, like pocket instrument called life-preserver, much designed purposes protection assault. But I none passing thoughts subject save Dora, I glanced her, directly afterwards, thinking I saw, her prettily pettish manner, she much inclined particularly confidential her companion protector, bell rang, Mr. Spenlow said first dinner-bell, carried dress. The idea dressing one’s self, anything way action, state love, little ridiculous. I could sit fire, biting key carpet-bag, think captivating, girlish, bright-eyed lovely Dora. What form she had, face she had, graceful, variable, enchanting manner! The bell rang soon I made mere scramble dressing, instead careful operation I could wished circumstances, went downstairs. There company. Dora talking old gentleman grey head. Grey he was--and great-grandfather bargain, he said so--I madly jealous him. What state mind I in! I jealous everybody. I could not bear idea anybody knowing Mr. Spenlow better I did. It torturing hear talk occurrences I share. When amiable person, highly polished bald head, asked across dinner table, first occasion seeing grounds, I could done anything savage revengeful. I do not remember there, except Dora. I least idea dinner, besides Dora. My impression is, I dined Dora, entirely, sent away half-a-dozen plates untouched. I sat next her. I talked her. She delightful little voice, gayest little laugh, pleasantest fascinating little ways, ever led lost youth hopeless slavery. She rather diminutive altogether. So much precious, I thought. When she went room Miss Murdstone (no ladies party), I fell reverie, disturbed cruel apprehension Miss Murdstone would disparage her. The amiable creature polished head told long story, I think gardening. I think I heard say, ‘my gardener’, several times. I seemed pay deepest attention him, I wandering garden Eden while, Dora. My apprehensions disparaged object engrossing affection revived went drawing-room, grim distant aspect Miss Murdstone. But I relieved unexpected manner. ‘David Copperfield,’ said Miss Murdstone, beckoning aside window. ‘A word.’ I confronted Miss Murdstone alone. ‘David Copperfield,’ said Miss Murdstone, ‘I need enlarge upon family circumstances. They tempting subject.’ ‘Far it, madam,’ I returned. ‘Far it,’ assented Miss Murdstone. ‘I wish revive memory past differences, past outrages. I received outrages person--a female I sorry say, credit sex--who mentioned without scorn disgust; therefore I would rather mention her.’ I felt fiery aunt’s account; I said would certainly better, Miss Murdstone pleased, mention her. I could hear her disrespectfully mentioned, I added, without expressing opinion decided tone. Miss Murdstone shut her eyes, disdainfully inclined her head; then, slowly opening her eyes, resumed: ‘David Copperfield, I shall attempt disguise fact, I formed unfavourable opinion childhood. It may mistaken one, may ceased justify it. That question us now. I belong family remarkable, I believe, firmness; I creature circumstance change. I may opinion you. You may opinion me.’ I inclined head, turn. ‘But necessary,’ said Miss Murdstone, ‘that opinions come collision here. Under existing circumstances, well accounts not. As chances life brought us together again, may bring us together occasions, I would say, let us meet distant acquaintances. Family circumstances sufficient reason meeting footing, quite unnecessary either us make subject remark. Do approve this?’ ‘Miss Murdstone,’ I returned, ‘I think Mr. Murdstone used cruelly, treated mother great unkindness. I shall always think so, long I live. But I quite agree propose.’ Miss Murdstone shut her eyes again, bent her head. Then, touching back hand tips her cold, stiff fingers, she walked away, arranging little fetters her wrists round her neck; seemed set, exactly state, I seen her last. These reminded me, reference Miss Murdstone’s nature, fetters jail door; suggesting outside, beholders, expected within. All I know rest evening is, I heard empress heart sing enchanted ballads French language, generally effect that, whatever matter, ought always dance, Ta ra la, Ta ra la! accompanying herself glorified instrument, resembling guitar. That I lost blissful delirium. That I refused refreshment. That soul recoiled punch particularly. That Miss Murdstone took her custody led her away, she smiled gave her delicious hand. That I caught view mirror, looking perfectly imbecile idiotic. That I retired bed maudlin state mind, got crisis feeble infatuation. It fine morning, early, I thought I would go take stroll one wire-arched walks, indulge passion dwelling her image. On way hall, I encountered her little dog, called Jip--short Gipsy. I approached tenderly, I loved even him; he showed his whole set teeth, got chair expressly snarl, would not hear least familiarity. The garden cool solitary. I walked about, wondering feelings happiness would be, I could ever become engaged dear wonder. As marriage, fortune, that, I believe I almost innocently undesigning then, I loved little Them’ly. To allowed call her ‘Dora’, write her, dote upon worship her, reason think she people she yet mindful me, seemed summit human ambition--I sure summit mine. There doubt whatever I lackadaisical young spooney; purity heart this, prevents quite contemptuous recollection it, let laugh I may. I walking long, I turned corner, met her. I tingle head foot recollection turns corner, pen shakes hand. ‘You--are--out early, Miss Spenlow,’ said I. ‘It is stupid home,’ she replied, ‘and Miss Murdstone absurd! She talks nonsense necessary day aired, I come out. Aired!’ (She laughed, here, melodious manner.) ‘On Sunday morning, I do not practise, I must something. So I told papa last night I must come out. Besides, it is brightest time whole day. Do not think so?’ I hazarded bold flight, said (not without stammering) bright then, though dark minute before. ‘Do mean compliment?’ said Dora, ‘or weather really changed?’ I stammered worse before, replying I meant compliment, plain truth; though I aware change taken place weather. It state feelings, I added bashfully: clench explanation. I never saw curls--how could I, never curls!--as she shook hide her blushes. As straw hat blue ribbons top curls, I could hung room Buckingham Street, priceless possession would been! ‘You come home Paris,’ said I. ‘Yes,’ said she. ‘Have ever there?’ ‘No.’ ‘Oh! I hope you will go soon! You would like much!’ Traces deep-seated anguish appeared countenance. That she hope I would go, she think possible I could go, insupportable. I depreciated Paris; I depreciated France. I said I would not leave England, existing circumstances, earthly consideration. Nothing induce me. In short, she shaking curls again, little dog came running along walk relief. He mortally jealous me, persisted barking me. She took her arms--oh goodness!--and caressed him, he persisted upon barking still. He would not let touch him, I tried; she beat him. It increased sufferings greatly see pats she gave punishment bridge his blunt nose, he winked his eyes, licked her hand, still growled within like little double-bass. At length he quiet--well he might her dimpled chin upon his head!--and walked away look greenhouse. ‘You intimate Miss Murdstone, you?’ said Dora. --‘My pet.’ (The two last words dog. Oh, me!) ‘No,’ I replied. ‘Not so.’ ‘She tiresome creature,’ said Dora, pouting. ‘I cannot think papa about, he chose vexatious thing companion. Who wants protector? I sure I do not want protector. Jip protect great deal better Miss Murdstone,--cannot you, Jip, dear?’ He winked lazily, she kissed his ball head. ‘Papa calls her confidential friend, I sure she thing--is she, Jip? We going confide cross people, Jip I. We mean bestow confidence like, find friends, instead found us--do not we, Jip?’ Jip made comfortable noise, answer, little like tea-kettle sings. As me, every word new heap fetters, riveted last. ‘It hard, kind Mama, have, instead, sulky, gloomy old thing like Miss Murdstone, always following us about--is not it, Jip? Never mind, Jip. We will not confidential, we will make happy spite her, we will tease her, please her--will not we, Jip?’ If lasted longer, I think I must gone knees gravel, probability grazing them, presently ejected premises besides. But, good fortune greenhouse far off, words brought us it. It contained quite show beautiful geraniums. We loitered along front them, Dora often stopped admire one one, I stopped admire one, Dora, laughing, held dog childishly, smell flowers; three Fairyland, certainly I was. The scent geranium leaf, day, strikes half comical half serious wonder change come moment; I see straw hat blue ribbons, quantity curls, little black dog held up, two slender arms, bank blossoms bright leaves. Miss Murdstone looking us. She found us here; presented her uncongenial cheek, little wrinkles filled hair powder, Dora kissed. Then she took Dora’s arm hers, marched us breakfast soldier’s funeral. How many cups tea I drank, Dora made it, I do not know. But, I perfectly remember I sat swilling tea whole nervous system, I days, must gone board. By went church. Miss Murdstone Dora pew; I heard her sing, congregation vanished. A sermon delivered--about Dora, course--and I afraid I know service. We quiet day. No company, walk, family dinner four, evening looking books pictures; Miss Murdstone homily her, her eye upon us, keeping guard vigilantly. Ah! little Mr. Spenlow imagine, he sat opposite dinner day, his pocket-handkerchief his head, fervently I embracing him, fancy, his son-in-law! Little he think, I took leave night, he given his full consent engaged Dora, I invoking blessings his head! We departed early morning, Salvage case coming Admiralty Court, requiring rather accurate knowledge whole science navigation, (as could not expected know much matters Commons) judge entreated two old Trinity Masters, charity’s sake, come help out. Dora breakfast-table make tea again, however; I melancholy pleasure taking hat her phaeton, she stood door-step Jip her arms. What Admiralty day; nonsense I made case mind, I listened it; I saw ‘DORA’ engraved upon blade silver oar lay upon table, emblem high jurisdiction; I felt Mr. Spenlow went home without (I insane hope he might take back again), I mariner myself, ship I belonged sailed away left desert island; I shall make fruitless effort describe. If sleepy old court could rouse itself, present visible form daydreams I Dora, would reveal truth. I do not mean dreams I dreamed day alone, day day, week week, term term. I went there, attend going on, think Dora. If ever I bestowed thought upon cases, dragged slow length me, wonder, matrimonial cases (remembering Dora), married people could ever otherwise happy; and, Prerogative cases, consider, money question left me, foremost steps I immediately taken regard Dora. Within first week passion, I bought four sumptuous waistcoats--not myself; I pride them; Dora--and took wearing straw-coloured kid gloves streets, laid foundations corns I ever had. If boots I wore period could produced compared natural size feet, would show state heart was, affecting manner. And yet, wretched cripple I made act homage Dora, I walked miles upon miles daily hope seeing her. Not I soon well known Norwood Road postmen beat, I pervaded London likewise. I walked streets best shops ladies were, I haunted Bazaar like unquiet spirit, I fagged Park again, long I quite knocked up. Sometimes, long intervals rare occasions, I saw her. Perhaps I saw her glove waved carriage window; perhaps I met her, walked her Miss Murdstone little way, spoke her. In latter case I always miserable afterwards, think I said nothing purpose; she idea extent devotion, she cared nothing me. I always looking out, may supposed, another invitation Mr. Spenlow’s house. I always disappointed, I got none. Mrs. Crupp must woman penetration; attachment weeks old, I courage write explicitly even Agnes, I Mr. Spenlow’s house, ‘whose family,’ I added, ‘consists one daughter’;--I say Mrs. Crupp must woman penetration, for, even early stage, she found out. She came one evening, I low, ask (she afflicted disorder I mentioned) I could oblige her little tincture cardamums mixed rhubarb, flavoured seven drops essence cloves, best remedy her complaint;--or, I thing me, little brandy, next best. It not, she remarked, palatable her, next best. As I never even heard first remedy, always second closet, I gave Mrs. Crupp glass second, (that I might suspicion devoted improper use) she began take presence. ‘Cheer up, sir,’ said Mrs. Crupp. ‘I cannot abear see so, sir: I am mother myself.’ I quite perceive application fact myself, I smiled Mrs. Crupp, benignly power. ‘Come, sir,’ said Mrs. Crupp. ‘Excuse me. I know is, sir. There is lady case.’ ‘Mrs. Crupp?’ I returned, reddening. ‘Oh, bless you! Keep good heart, sir!’ said Mrs. Crupp, nodding encouragement. ‘Never say die, sir! If She do not smile upon you, there is many will. You young gentleman smiled on, Mr. Copperfull, must learn walue, sir.’ Mrs. Crupp always called Mr. Copperfull: firstly, doubt, name; secondly, I inclined think, indistinct association washing-day. ‘What makes suppose young lady case, Mrs. Crupp?’ said I. ‘Mr. Copperfull,’ said Mrs. Crupp, great deal feeling, ‘I am mother myself.’ For time Mrs. Crupp could lay her hand upon her nankeen bosom, fortify herself returning pain sips her medicine. At length she spoke again. ‘When present set took dear aunt, Mr. Copperfull,’ said Mrs. Crupp, ‘my remark were, I found summun I could care for. “Thank Ev’in!” expression, “I found summun I care for!”--You do not eat enough, sir, yet drink.’ ‘Is found supposition on, Mrs. Crupp?’ said I. ‘Sir,’ said Mrs. Crupp, tone approaching severity, ‘I have laundressed young gentlemen besides yourself. A young gentleman may over-careful himself, he may under-careful himself. He may brush his hair regular, un-regular. He may wear his boots much large him, much small. That according young gentleman his original character formed. But let go extreme he may, sir, there is young lady ‘them.’ Mrs. Crupp shook her head determined manner, I inch vantage-ground left. ‘It gentleman died yourself,’ said Mrs. Crupp, ‘that fell love--with barmaid--and his waistcoats took directly, though much swelled drinking.’ ‘Mrs. Crupp,’ said I, ‘I must beg connect young lady case barmaid, anything sort, please.’ ‘Mr. Copperfull,’ returned Mrs. Crupp, ‘I am mother myself, likely. I ask pardon, sir, I intrude. I never wish intrude I welcome. But young gentleman, Mr. Copperfull, adwice is, cheer up, sir, keep good heart, know walue. If take something, sir,’ said Mrs. Crupp, ‘if take skittles, now, healthy, might find divert mind, good.’ With words, Mrs. Crupp, affecting careful brandy--which gone--thanked majestic curtsey, retired. As her figure disappeared gloom entry, counsel certainly presented mind light slight liberty Mrs. Crupp’s part; but, time, I content receive it, another point view, word wise, warning future keep secret better. CHAPTER 27. TOMMY TRADDLES It may consequence Mrs. Crupp’s advice, and, perhaps, better reason certain similarity sound word skittles Traddles, came head, next day, go look Traddles. The time he mentioned out, he lived little street near Veterinary College Camden Town, principally tenanted, one clerks lived direction informed me, gentlemen students, bought live donkeys, made experiments quadrupeds private apartments. Having obtained clerk direction academic grove question, I set out, afternoon, visit old schoolfellow. I found street desirable one I could wished be, sake Traddles. The inhabitants appeared propensity throw little trifles want of, road: made rank sloppy, untidy too, account cabbage-leaves. The refuse wholly vegetable either, I saw shoe, doubled-up saucepan, black bonnet, umbrella, various stages decomposition, I looking number I wanted. The general air place reminded forcibly days I lived Mr. Mrs. Micawber. An indescribable character faded gentility attached house I sought, made unlike houses street--though built one monotonous pattern, looked like early copies blundering boy learning make houses, yet got his cramped brick-and-mortar pothooks--reminded still Mr. Mrs. Micawber. Happening arrive door opened afternoon milkman, I reminded Mr. Mrs. Micawber forcibly yet. ‘Now,’ said milkman youthful servant girl. ‘Has little bill mine heerd on?’ ‘Oh, master says he will attend immediate,’ reply. ‘Because,’ said milkman, going he received answer, speaking, I judged his tone, rather edification somebody within house, youthful servant--an impression strengthened his manner glaring passage--‘because little bill running long, I begin believe it is run away altogether, never will not heerd of. Now, I am going stand it, know!’ said milkman, still throwing his voice house, glaring passage. As his dealing mild article milk, by, never greater anomaly. His deportment would fierce butcher brandy-merchant. The voice youthful servant became faint, she seemed me, action her lips, murmur would attended immediate. ‘I tell what,’ said milkman, looking hard her first time, taking her chin, ‘are fond milk?’ ‘Yes, I likes it,’ she replied. ‘Good,’ said milkman. ‘Then will not none tomorrow. D’ye hear? Not fragment milk will not tomorrow.’ I thought she seemed, upon whole, relieved prospect today. The milkman, shaking his head her darkly, released her chin, anything rather good-will opened his can, deposited usual quantity family jug. This done, he went away, muttering, uttered cry his trade next door, vindictive shriek. ‘Does Mr. Traddles live here?’ I inquired. A mysterious voice end passage replied ‘Yes.’ Upon youthful servant replied ‘Yes.’ ‘Is he home?’ said I. Again mysterious voice replied affirmative, servant echoed it. Upon this, I walked in, pursuance servant’s directions walked upstairs; conscious, I passed back parlour-door, I surveyed mysterious eye, probably belonging mysterious voice. When I got top stairs--the house story high ground floor--Traddles landing meet me. He delighted see me, gave welcome, great heartiness, his little room. It front house, extremely neat, though sparely furnished. It his room, I saw; sofa-bedstead it, his blacking-brushes blacking among his books--on top shelf, behind dictionary. His table covered papers, he hard work old coat. I looked nothing, I know of, I saw everything, even prospect church upon his china inkstand, I sat down--and this, too, faculty confirmed old Micawber times. Various ingenious arrangements he made, disguise his chest drawers, accommodation his boots, his shaving-glass, forth, particularly impressed upon me, evidences Traddles used make models elephants’ dens writing-paper put flies in; comfort ill usage, memorable works art I often mentioned. In corner room something neatly covered large white cloth. I could make was. ‘Traddles,’ said I, shaking hands again, I sat down, ‘I delighted see you.’ ‘I delighted see YOU, Copperfield,’ he returned. ‘I glad indeed see you. It I thoroughly glad see met Ely Place, sure thoroughly glad see me, I gave address instead address chambers.’ ‘Oh! You chambers?’ said I. ‘Why, I fourth room passage, fourth clerk,’ returned Traddles. ‘Three others unite set chambers--to look business-like--and quarter clerk too. Half-a-crown week he costs me.’ His old simple character good temper, something his old unlucky fortune also, I thought, smiled smile he made explanation. ‘It is I least pride, Copperfield, understand,’ said Traddles, ‘that I do not usually give address here. It is account come me, might like come here. For myself, I fighting way world difficulties, would ridiculous I made pretence anything else.’ ‘You reading bar, Mr. Waterbrook informed me?’ said I. ‘Why, yes,’ said Traddles, rubbing his hands slowly one another. ‘I reading bar. The fact is, I begun keep terms, rather long delay. It is time since I articled, payment hundred pounds great pull. A great pull!’ said Traddles, wince, he tooth out. ‘Do know I cannot help thinking of, Traddles, I sit looking you?’ I asked him. ‘No,’ said he. ‘That sky-blue suit used wear.’ ‘Lord, sure!’ cried Traddles, laughing. ‘Tight arms legs, know? Dear me! Well! Those happy times, were not they?’ ‘I think schoolmaster might made happier, without harm us, I acknowledge,’ I returned. ‘Perhaps he might,’ said Traddles. ‘But dear me, good deal fun going on. Do remember nights bedroom? When used suppers? And used tell stories? Ha, ha, ha! And remember I got caned crying Mr. Mell? Old Creakle! I like see again, too!’ ‘He brute you, Traddles,’ said I, indignantly; his good humour made feel I seen beaten yesterday. ‘Do think so?’ returned Traddles. ‘Really? Perhaps he rather. But it is over, long while. Old Creakle!’ ‘You brought uncle, then?’ said I. ‘Of course I was!’ said Traddles. ‘The one I always going write to. And always did not, eh! Ha, ha, ha! Yes, I uncle then. He died soon I left school.’ ‘Indeed!’ ‘Yes. He retired--what call it!--draper--cloth-merchant--and made his heir. But he did not like I grew up.’ ‘Do really mean that?’ said I. He composed, I fancied he must meaning. ‘Oh dear, yes, Copperfield! I mean it,’ replied Traddles. ‘It unfortunate thing, he did not like all. He said I was not he expected, he married his housekeeper.’ ‘And do?’ I asked. ‘I did not anything particular,’ said Traddles. ‘I lived them, waiting put world, his gout unfortunately flew his stomach--and he died, she married young man, I was not provided for.’ ‘Did get nothing, Traddles, all?’ ‘Oh dear, yes!’ said Traddles. ‘I got fifty pounds. I never brought profession, first I loss myself. However, I began, assistance son professional man, Salem House--Yawler, his nose one side. Do recollect him?’ No. He me; noses straight day. ‘It do not matter,’ said Traddles. ‘I began, means his assistance, copy law writings. That did not answer well; I began state cases them, make abstracts, sort work. For I plodding kind fellow, Copperfield, learnt way things pithily. Well! That put head enter law student; ran away left fifty pounds. Yawler recommended one two offices, however--Mr. Waterbrook’s one--and I got good many jobs. I fortunate enough, too, become acquainted person publishing way, getting Encyclopaedia, he set work; and, indeed’ (glancing his table), ‘I work minute. I bad compiler, Copperfield,’ said Traddles, preserving air cheerful confidence he said, ‘but I invention all; particle. I suppose never young man less originality I have.’ As Traddles seemed expect I assent matter course, I nodded; he went on, sprightly patience--I find better expression--as before. ‘So, little little, living high, I managed scrape hundred pounds last,’ said Traddles; ‘and thank Heaven that is paid--though was--though certainly was,’ said Traddles, wincing he another tooth out, ‘a pull. I living sort work I mentioned, still, I hope, one days, get connected newspaper: would almost making fortune. Now, Copperfield, exactly used be, agreeable face, it is pleasant see you, I shall not conceal anything. Therefore must know I engaged.’ Engaged! Oh, Dora! ‘She curate’s daughter,’ said Traddles; ‘one ten, Devonshire. Yes!’ For he saw glance, involuntarily, prospect inkstand. ‘That is church! You come round left, gate,’ tracing his finger along inkstand, ‘and exactly I hold pen, stands house--facing, understand, towards church.’ The delight he entered particulars, fully present afterwards; selfish thoughts making ground-plan Mr. Spenlow’s house garden moment. ‘She dear girl!’ said Traddles; ‘a little older me, dearest girl! I told I going town? I there. I walked there, I walked back, I delightful time! I dare say likely rather long engagement, motto “Wait hope!” We always say that. “Wait hope,” always say. And she would wait, Copperfield, till she sixty--any age mention--for me!’ Traddles rose his chair, and, triumphant smile, put his hand upon white cloth I observed. ‘However,’ he said, ‘it is have not made beginning towards housekeeping. No, no; begun. We must get degrees, begun. Here,’ drawing cloth great pride care, ‘are two pieces furniture commence with. This flower-pot stand, she bought herself. You put parlour window,’ said Traddles, falling little back survey greater admiration, ‘with plant it, and--and are! This little round table marble top (it is two feet ten circumference), I bought. You want lay book down, know, somebody comes see wife, wants place stand cup tea upon, and--and again!’ said Traddles. ‘It is admirable piece workmanship--firm rock!’ I praised both, highly, Traddles replaced covering carefully he removed it. ‘It is great deal towards furnishing,’ said Traddles, ‘but it is something. The table-cloths, pillow-cases, articles kind, discourage most, Copperfield. So ironmongery--candle-boxes, gridirons, sort necessaries--because things tell, mount up. However, “wait hope!” And I assure she is dearest girl!’ ‘I quite certain it,’ said I. ‘In meantime,’ said Traddles, coming back his chair; ‘and end prosing myself, I get well I can. I do not make much, I do not spend much. In general, I board people downstairs, agreeable people indeed. Both Mr. Mrs. Micawber seen good deal life, excellent company.’ ‘My dear Traddles!’ I quickly exclaimed. ‘What talking about?’ Traddles looked me, he wondered I talking about. ‘Mr. Mrs. Micawber!’ I repeated. ‘Why, I intimately acquainted them!’ An opportune double knock door, I knew well old experience Windsor Terrace, nobody Mr. Micawber could ever knocked door, resolved doubt mind old friends. I begged Traddles ask his landlord walk up. Traddles accordingly so, banister; Mr. Micawber, bit changed--his tights, his stick, his shirt-collar, his eye-glass, ever--came room genteel youthful air. ‘I beg pardon, Mr. Traddles,’ said Mr. Micawber, old roll his voice, he checked humming soft tune. ‘I aware individual, alien tenement, sanctum.’ Mr. Micawber slightly bowed me, pulled his shirt-collar. ‘How do, Mr. Micawber?’ said I. ‘Sir,’ said Mr. Micawber, ‘you exceedingly obliging. I statu quo.’ ‘And Mrs. Micawber?’ I pursued. ‘Sir,’ said Mr. Micawber, ‘she also, thank God, statu quo.’ ‘And children, Mr. Micawber?’ ‘Sir,’ said Mr. Micawber, ‘I rejoice reply are, likewise, enjoyment salubrity.’ All time, Mr. Micawber known least, though he stood face face me. But now, seeing smile, he examined features attention, fell back, cried, ‘Is possible! Have I pleasure beholding Copperfield!’ shook hands utmost fervour. ‘Good Heaven, Mr. Traddles!’ said Mr. Micawber, ‘to think I find acquainted friend youth, companion earlier days! My dear!’ calling banisters Mrs. Micawber, Traddles looked (with reason) little amazed description me. ‘Here gentleman Mr. Traddles’s apartment, he wishes pleasure presenting you, love!’ Mr. Micawber immediately reappeared, shook hands again. ‘And good friend Doctor, Copperfield?’ said Mr. Micawber, ‘and circle Canterbury?’ ‘I none good accounts them,’ said I. ‘I delighted hear it,’ said Mr. Micawber. ‘It Canterbury last met. Within shadow, I may figuratively say, religious edifice immortalized Chaucer, anciently resort Pilgrims remotest corners of--in short,’ said Mr. Micawber, ‘in immediate neighbourhood Cathedral.’ I replied was. Mr. Micawber continued talking volubly he could; not, I thought, without showing, marks concern his countenance, he sensible sounds next room, Mrs. Micawber washing her hands, hurriedly opening shutting drawers uneasy action. ‘You find us, Copperfield,’ said Mr. Micawber, one eye Traddles, ‘at present established, may designated small unassuming scale; but, aware I have, course career, surmounted difficulties, conquered obstacles. You stranger fact, periods life, requisite I pause, certain expected events turn up; necessary I fall back, making I trust I shall accused presumption terming--a spring. The present one momentous stages life man. You find me, fallen back, FOR spring; I every reason believe vigorous leap shortly result.’ I expressing satisfaction, Mrs. Micawber came in; little slatternly she used be, she seemed now, unaccustomed eyes, still preparation herself company, pair brown gloves on. ‘My dear,’ said Mr. Micawber, leading her towards me, ‘here gentleman name Copperfield, wishes renew his acquaintance you.’ It would better, turned out, led gently announcement, Mrs. Micawber, delicate state health, overcome it, taken unwell, Mr. Micawber obliged, great trepidation, run water-butt backyard, draw basinful lave her brow with. She presently revived, however, really pleased see me. We half-an-hour’s talk, together; I asked her twins, who, she said, ‘grown great creatures’; Master Miss Micawber, she described ‘absolute giants’, produced occasion. Mr. Micawber anxious I stay dinner. I averse so, I imagined I detected trouble, calculation relative extent cold meat, Mrs. Micawber’s eye. I therefore pleaded another engagement; observing Mrs. Micawber’s spirits immediately lightened, I resisted persuasion forego it. But I told Traddles, Mr. Mrs. Micawber, I could think leaving, must appoint day would come dine me. The occupations Traddles stood pledged, rendered necessary fix somewhat distant one; appointment made purpose, suited us all, I took leave. Mr. Micawber, pretence showing nearer way I come, accompanied corner street; anxious (he explained me) say words old friend, confidence. ‘My dear Copperfield,’ said Mr. Micawber, ‘I need hardly tell beneath roof, existing circumstances, mind like gleams--if I may allowed expression--which gleams--in friend Traddles, unspeakable comfort. With washerwoman, exposes hard-bake sale her parlour-window, dwelling next door, Bow-street officer residing way, may imagine his society source consolation Mrs. Micawber. I present, dear Copperfield, engaged sale corn upon commission. It avocation remunerative description--in words, pay--and temporary embarrassments pecuniary nature consequence. I am, however, delighted add I immediate prospect something turning (I liberty say direction), I trust enable provide, permanently, friend Traddles, I unaffected interest. You may, perhaps, prepared hear Mrs. Micawber state health renders wholly improbable addition may ultimately made pledges affection which--in short, infantine group. Mrs. Micawber’s family good express dissatisfaction state things. I merely observe, I aware business theirs, I repel exhibition feeling scorn, defiance!’ Mr. Micawber shook hands again, left me. CHAPTER 28. Mr. MICAWBER’S GAUNTLET Until day arrived I entertain newly-found old friends, I lived principally Dora coffee. In love-lorn condition, appetite languished; I glad it, I felt though would act perfidy towards Dora natural relish dinner. The quantity walking exercise I took, respect attended usual consequence, disappointment counteracted fresh air. I doubts, too, founded acute experience acquired period life, whether sound enjoyment animal food develop freely human subject always torment tight boots. I think extremities require peace stomach conduct vigour. On occasion domestic little party, I repeat former extensive preparations. I merely provided pair soles, small leg mutton, pigeon-pie. Mrs. Crupp broke rebellion first bashful hint reference cooking fish joint, said, dignified sense injury, ‘No! No, sir! You ask sich thing, better acquainted suppose capable I cannot ampial satisfaction feelings!’ But, end, compromise effected; Mrs. Crupp consented achieve feat, condition I dined home fortnight afterwards. And I may remark, I underwent Mrs. Crupp, consequence tyranny she established me, dreadful. I never much afraid anyone. We made compromise everything. If I hesitated, she taken wonderful disorder always lying ambush her system, ready, shortest notice, prey upon her vitals. If I rang bell impatiently, half-a-dozen unavailing modest pulls, she appeared last--which means relied upon--she would appear reproachful aspect, sink breathless chair near door, lay her hand upon her nankeen bosom, become ill, I glad, sacrifice brandy anything else, get rid her. If I objected bed made five of the clock afternoon--which I still think uncomfortable arrangement--one motion her hand towards nankeen region wounded sensibility enough make falter apology. In short, I would done anything honourable way rather give Mrs. Crupp offence; she terror life. I bought second-hand dumb-waiter dinner-party, preference re-engaging handy young man; I conceived prejudice, consequence meeting Strand, one Sunday morning, waistcoat remarkably like one mine, missing since former occasion. The ‘young gal’ re-engaged; stipulation she bring dishes, withdraw landing-place, beyond outer door; habit sniffing she contracted would lost upon guests, her retiring plates would physical impossibility. Having laid materials bowl punch, compounded Mr. Micawber; provided bottle lavender-water, two wax-candles, paper mixed pins, pincushion, assist Mrs. Micawber her toilette dressing-table; also caused fire bedroom lighted Mrs. Micawber’s convenience; laid cloth hands, I awaited result composure. At appointed time, three visitors arrived together. Mr. Micawber shirt-collar usual, new ribbon his eye-glass; Mrs. Micawber her cap whitey-brown paper parcel; Traddles carrying parcel, supporting Mrs. Micawber his arm. They delighted residence. When I conducted Mrs. Micawber dressing-table, she saw scale prepared her, she raptures, she called Mr. Micawber come look. ‘My dear Copperfield,’ said Mr. Micawber, ‘this luxurious. This way life reminds period I state celibacy, Mrs. Micawber yet solicited plight her faith Hymeneal altar.’ ‘He means, solicited him, Mr. Copperfield,’ said Mrs. Micawber, archly. ‘He cannot answer others.’ ‘My dear,’ returned Mr. Micawber sudden seriousness, ‘I desire answer others. I well aware when, inscrutable decrees Fate, reserved me, possible may reserved one, destined, protracted struggle, length fall victim pecuniary involvements complicated nature. I understand allusion, love. I regret it, I bear it.’ ‘Micawber!’ exclaimed Mrs. Micawber, tears. ‘Have I deserved this! I, never deserted you; never WILL desert you, Micawber!’ ‘My love,’ said Mr. Micawber, much affected, ‘you forgive, old tried friend Copperfield will, I sure, forgive, momentary laceration wounded spirit, made sensitive recent collision Minion Power--in words, ribald Turncock attached water-works--and pity, condemn, excesses.’ Mr. Micawber embraced Mrs. Micawber, pressed hand; leaving infer broken allusion his domestic supply water cut afternoon, consequence default payment company’s rates. To divert his thoughts melancholy subject, I informed Mr. Micawber I relied upon bowl punch, led lemons. His recent despondency, say despair, gone moment. I never saw man thoroughly enjoy amid fragrance lemon-peel sugar, odour burning rum, steam boiling water, Mr. Micawber afternoon. It wonderful see his face shining us thin cloud delicate fumes, he stirred, mixed, tasted, looked he making, instead punch, fortune his family latest posterity. As Mrs. Micawber, I do not know whether effect cap, lavender-water, pins, fire, wax-candles, she came room, comparatively speaking, lovely. And lark never gayer excellent woman. I suppose--I never ventured inquire, I suppose--that Mrs. Crupp, frying soles, taken ill. Because broke point. The leg mutton came red within, pale without: besides foreign substance gritty nature sprinkled it, fall ashes remarkable kitchen fireplace. But condition judge fact appearance gravy, forasmuch ‘young gal’ dropped upon stairs--where remained, by, long train, worn out. The pigeon-pie bad, delusive pie: crust like disappointing head, phrenologically speaking: full lumps bumps, nothing particular underneath. In short, banquet failure I quite unhappy--about failure, I mean, I always unhappy Dora--if I relieved great good humour company, bright suggestion Mr. Micawber. ‘My dear friend Copperfield,’ said Mr. Micawber, ‘accidents occur best-regulated families; families regulated pervading influence sanctifies enhances the--a--I would say, short, influence Woman, lofty character Wife, may expected confidence, must borne philosophy. If allow take liberty remarking comestibles better, way, Devil, I believe, little division labour, could accomplish good one young person attendance could produce gridiron, I would put you, little misfortune may easily repaired.’ There gridiron pantry, morning rasher bacon cooked. We in, twinkling, immediately applied carrying Mr. Micawber’s idea effect. The division labour he referred this:--Traddles cut mutton slices; Mr. Micawber (who could anything sort perfection) covered pepper, mustard, salt, cayenne; I put gridiron, turned fork, took off, Mr. Micawber’s direction; Mrs. Micawber heated, continually stirred, mushroom ketchup little saucepan. When slices enough done begin upon, fell-to, sleeves still tucked wrist, slices sputtering blazing fire, attention divided mutton plates, mutton preparing. What novelty cookery, excellence it, bustle it, frequent starting look it, frequent sitting dispose crisp slices came gridiron hot hot, busy, flushed fire, amused, midst tempting noise savour, reduced leg mutton bone. My appetite came back miraculously. I ashamed record it, I really believe I forgot Dora little while. I satisfied Mr. Mrs. Micawber could enjoyed feast more, sold bed provide it. Traddles laughed heartily, almost whole time, he ate worked. Indeed did, once; I dare say never greater success. We height enjoyment, busily engaged, several departments, endeavouring bring last batch slices state perfection crown feast, I aware strange presence room, eyes encountered staid Littimer, standing hat hand me. ‘What is matter?’ I involuntarily asked. ‘I beg pardon, sir, I directed come in. Is master here, sir?’ ‘No.’ ‘Have seen him, sir?’ ‘No; do not come him?’ ‘Not immediately so, sir.’ ‘Did he tell would find here?’ ‘Not exactly so, sir. But I think he might tomorrow, he today.’ ‘Is he coming Oxford?’ ‘I beg, sir,’ he returned respectfully, ‘that seated, allow this.’ With he took fork unresisting hand, bent gridiron, his whole attention concentrated it. We much discomposed, I dare say, appearance Steerforth himself, became moment meekest meek his respectable serving-man. Mr. Micawber, humming tune, show he quite ease, subsided his chair, handle hastily concealed fork sticking bosom his coat, he stabbed himself. Mrs. Micawber put her brown gloves, assumed genteel languor. Traddles ran his greasy hands his hair, stood bolt upright, stared confusion table-cloth. As me, I mere infant head table; hardly ventured glance respectable phenomenon, come Heaven knows where, put establishment rights. Meanwhile he took mutton gridiron, gravely handed round. We took some, appreciation gone, merely made show eating it. As severally pushed away plates, he noiselessly removed them, set cheese. He took off, too, done with; cleared table; piled everything dumb-waiter; gave us wine-glasses; and, his accord, wheeled dumb-waiter pantry. All done perfect manner, he never raised his eyes he about. Yet his elbows, he his back towards me, seemed teem expression his fixed opinion I extremely young. ‘Can I anything more, sir?’ I thanked said, No; would he take dinner himself? ‘None, I obliged you, sir.’ ‘Is Mr. Steerforth coming Oxford?’ ‘I beg pardon, sir?’ ‘Is Mr. Steerforth coming Oxford?’ ‘I imagine he might tomorrow, sir. I rather thought he might today, sir. The mistake mine, doubt, sir.’ ‘If see first--’ said I. ‘If you will excuse me, sir, I do not think I shall see first.’ ‘In case do,’ said I, ‘pray say I sorry he today, old schoolfellow his here.’ ‘Indeed, sir!’ he divided bow Traddles, glance latter. He moving softly door, when, forlorn hope saying something naturally--which I never could, man--I said: ‘Oh! Littimer!’ ‘Sir!’ ‘Did remain long Yarmouth, time?’ ‘Not particularly so, sir.’ ‘You saw boat completed?’ ‘Yes, sir. I remained behind purpose see boat completed.’ ‘I know!’ He raised his eyes mine respectfully. ‘Mr. Steerforth seen yet, I suppose?’ ‘I really cannot say, sir. I think--but I really cannot say, sir. I wish good night, sir.’ He comprehended everybody present, respectful bow he followed words, disappeared. My visitors seemed breathe freely he gone; relief great, besides constraint, arising extraordinary sense disadvantage I always man’s presence, conscience embarrassed whispers I mistrusted his master, I could repress vague uneasy dread he might find out. How it, little reality conceal, I always DID feel man finding out? Mr. Micawber roused reflection, blended certain remorseful apprehension seeing Steerforth himself, bestowing many encomiums absent Littimer respectable fellow, thoroughly admirable servant. Mr. Micawber, I may remark, taken his full share general bow, received infinite condescension. ‘But punch, dear Copperfield,’ said Mr. Micawber, tasting it, ‘like time tide, waits man. Ah! present moment high flavour. My love, give opinion?’ Mrs. Micawber pronounced excellent. ‘Then I drink,’ said Mr. Micawber, ‘if friend Copperfield permit take social liberty, days friend Copperfield younger, fought way world side side. I may say, Copperfield, words sung together now, We twa hae run braes And pu’d gowans’ fine --in figurative point view--on several occasions. I exactly aware,’ said Mr. Micawber, old roll his voice, old indescribable air saying something genteel, ‘what gowans may be, I doubt Copperfield would frequently taken pull them, feasible.’ Mr. Micawber, present moment, took pull his punch. So did: Traddles evidently lost wondering distant time Mr. Micawber I could comrades battle world. ‘Ahem!’ said Mr. Micawber, clearing his throat, warming punch fire. ‘My dear, another glass?’ Mrs. Micawber said must little; could not allow that, glassful. ‘As quite confidential here, Mr. Copperfield,’ said Mrs. Micawber, sipping her punch, ‘Mr. Traddles part domesticity, I much like opinion Mr. Micawber’s prospects. For corn,’ said Mrs. Micawber argumentatively, ‘as I repeatedly said Mr. Micawber, may gentlemanly, remunerative. Commission extent two ninepence fortnight cannot, however limited ideas, considered remunerative.’ We agreed upon that. ‘Then,’ said Mrs. Micawber, prided herself taking clear view things, keeping Mr. Micawber straight her woman’s wisdom, he might otherwise go little crooked, ‘then I ask question. If corn relied upon, is? Are coals relied upon? Not all. We turned attention experiment, suggestion family, find fallacious.’ Mr. Micawber, leaning back his chair his hands his pockets, eyed us aside, nodded his head, much say case clearly put. ‘The articles corn coals,’ said Mrs. Micawber, still argumentatively, ‘being equally question, Mr. Copperfield, I naturally look round world, say, “What person Mr. Micawber’s talent likely succeed?” And I exclude anything commission, commission certainty. What best suited person Mr. Micawber’s peculiar temperament is, I convinced, certainty.’ Traddles I expressed, feeling murmur, great discovery doubt true Mr. Micawber, much credit. ‘I conceal you, dear Mr. Copperfield,’ said Mrs. Micawber, ‘that I long felt Brewing business particularly adapted Mr. Micawber. Look Barclay Perkins! Look Truman, Hanbury, Buxton! It extensive footing Mr. Micawber, I know knowledge him, calculated shine; profits, I told, e-NOR-MOUS! But Mr. Micawber cannot get firms--which decline answer his letters, he offers his services even inferior capacity--what use dwelling upon idea? None. I may conviction Mr. Micawber’s manners--’ ‘Hem! Really, dear,’ interposed Mr. Micawber. ‘My love, silent,’ said Mrs. Micawber, laying her brown glove his hand. ‘I may conviction, Mr. Copperfield, Mr. Micawber’s manners peculiarly qualify Banking business. I may argue within myself, I deposit banking-house, manners Mr. Micawber, representing banking-house, would inspire confidence, must extend connexion. But various banking-houses refuse avail Mr. Micawber’s abilities, receive offer contumely, use dwelling upon THAT idea? None. As originating banking-business, I may know members family who, chose place money Mr. Micawber’s hands, might found establishment description. But NOT choose place money Mr. Micawber’s hands--which do not--what use that? Again I contend farther advanced before.’ I shook head, said, ‘Not bit.’ Traddles also shook his head, said, ‘Not bit.’ ‘What I deduce this?’ Mrs. Micawber went say, still air putting case lucidly. ‘What conclusion, dear Mr. Copperfield, I irresistibly brought? Am I wrong saying, clear must live?’ I answered ‘Not all!’ Traddles answered ‘Not all!’ I found afterwards sagely adding, alone, person must either live die. ‘Just so,’ returned Mrs. Micawber, ‘It precisely that. And fact is, dear Mr. Copperfield, live without something widely different existing circumstances shortly turning up. Now I convinced, myself, I pointed Mr. Micawber several times late, things cannot expected turn themselves. We must, measure, assist turn up. I may wrong, I formed opinion.’ Both Traddles I applauded highly. ‘Very well,’ said Mrs. Micawber. ‘Then I recommend? Here Mr. Micawber variety qualifications--with great talent--’ ‘Really, love,’ said Mr. Micawber. ‘Pray, dear, allow conclude. Here Mr. Micawber, variety qualifications, great talent--I say, genius, may partiality wife--’ Traddles I murmured ‘No.’ ‘And Mr. Micawber without suitable position employment. Where responsibility rest? Clearly society. Then I would make fact disgraceful known, boldly challenge society set right. It appears me, dear Mr. Copperfield,’ said Mrs. Micawber, forcibly, ‘that Mr. Micawber do, throw gauntlet society, say, effect, “Show take up. Let party immediately step forward.”’ I ventured ask Mrs. Micawber done. ‘By advertising,’ said Mrs. Micawber--‘in papers. It appears me, Mr. Micawber do, justice himself, justice his family, I even go far say justice society, he hitherto overlooked, advertise papers; describe plainly so-and-so, qualifications put thus: “Now employ me, remunerative terms, address, post-paid, W. M., Post Office, Camden Town.”’ ‘This idea Mrs. Micawber’s, dear Copperfield,’ said Mr. Micawber, making his shirt-collar meet front his chin, glancing sideways, ‘is, fact, Leap I alluded, I last pleasure seeing you.’ ‘Advertising rather expensive,’ I remarked, dubiously. ‘Exactly so!’ said Mrs. Micawber, preserving logical air. ‘Quite true, dear Mr. Copperfield! I made identical observation Mr. Micawber. It reason especially, I think Mr. Micawber ought (as I already said, justice himself, justice his family, justice society) raise certain sum money--on bill.’ Mr. Micawber, leaning back his chair, trifled his eye-glass cast his eyes ceiling; I thought observant Traddles, too, looking fire. ‘If member family,’ said Mrs. Micawber, ‘is possessed sufficient natural feeling negotiate bill--I believe better business-term express I mean--’ Mr. Micawber, his eyes still cast ceiling, suggested ‘Discount.’ ‘To discount bill,’ said Mrs. Micawber, ‘then opinion is, Mr. Micawber go City, take bill Money Market, dispose he get. If individuals Money Market oblige Mr. Micawber sustain great sacrifice, consciences. I view it, steadily, investment. I recommend Mr. Micawber, dear Mr. Copperfield, same; regard investment sure return, make his mind sacrifice.’ I felt, I sure I do not know why, self-denying devoted Mrs. Micawber, I uttered murmur effect. Traddles, took his tone me, likewise, still looking fire. ‘I not,’ said Mrs. Micawber, finishing her punch, gathering her scarf her shoulders, preparatory her withdrawal bedroom: ‘I protract remarks subject Mr. Micawber’s pecuniary affairs. At fireside, dear Mr. Copperfield, presence Mr. Traddles, who, though old friend, quite one ourselves, I could refrain making acquainted course I advise Mr. Micawber take. I feel time arrived Mr. Micawber exert and--I add--assert himself, appears means. I aware I merely female, masculine judgement usually considered competent discussion questions; still I must forget that, I lived home papa mama, papa habit saying, “Emma’s form fragile, her grasp subject inferior none.” That papa partial, I well know; he observer character degree, duty reason equally forbid doubt.’ With words, resisting entreaties she would grace remaining circulation punch her presence, Mrs. Micawber retired bedroom. And really I felt she noble woman--the sort woman might Roman matron, done manner heroic things, times public trouble. In fervour impression, I congratulated Mr. Micawber treasure he possessed. So Traddles. Mr. Micawber extended his hand us succession, covered his face his pocket-handkerchief, I think snuff upon he aware of. He returned punch, highest state exhilaration. He full eloquence. He gave us understand children lived again, that, pressure pecuniary difficulties, accession number doubly welcome. He said Mrs. Micawber latterly her doubts point, he dispelled them, reassured her. As her family, totally unworthy her, sentiments utterly indifferent him, might--I quote his expression--go Devil. Mr. Micawber delivered warm eulogy Traddles. He said Traddles’s character, steady virtues he (Mr. Micawber) could lay claim, which, he thanked Heaven, he could admire. He feelingly alluded young lady, unknown, Traddles honoured his affection, reciprocated affection honouring blessing Traddles her affection. Mr. Micawber pledged her. So I. Traddles thanked us both, saying, simplicity honesty I sense enough quite charmed with, ‘I much obliged indeed. And I assure you, she is dearest girl!--’ Mr. Micawber took early opportunity, that, hinting, utmost delicacy ceremony, state affections. Nothing serious assurance his friend Copperfield contrary, he observed, could deprive impression his friend Copperfield loved beloved. After feeling hot uncomfortable time, good deal blushing, stammering, denying, I said, glass hand, ‘Well! I would give D.!’ excited gratified Mr. Micawber, he ran glass punch bedroom, order Mrs. Micawber might drink D., drank enthusiasm, crying within, shrill voice, ‘Hear, hear! My dear Mr. Copperfield, I delighted. Hear!’ tapping wall, way applause. Our conversation, afterwards, took worldly turn; Mr. Micawber telling us he found Camden Town inconvenient, first thing he contemplated doing, advertisement something satisfactory turning up, move. He mentioned terrace western end Oxford Street, fronting Hyde Park, he always his eye, he expect attain immediately, would require large establishment. There would probably interval, he explained, he content upper part house, respectable place business--say Piccadilly,--which would cheerful situation Mrs. Micawber; where, throwing bow-window, carrying roof another story, making little alteration sort, might live, comfortably reputably, years. Whatever reserved him, he expressly said, wherever his abode might be, might rely this--there would always room Traddles, knife fork me. We acknowledged his kindness; he begged us forgive his launched practical business-like details, excuse natural one making entirely new arrangements life. Mrs. Micawber, tapping wall know tea ready, broke particular phase friendly conversation. She made tea us agreeable manner; and, whenever I went near her, handing tea-cups bread-and-butter, asked me, whisper, whether D. fair, dark, whether she short, tall: something kind; I think I liked. After tea, discussed variety topics fire; Mrs. Micawber good enough sing us (in small, thin, flat voice, I remembered considered, I first knew her, table-beer acoustics) favourite ballads ‘The Dashing White Sergeant’, ‘Little Tafflin’. For songs Mrs. Micawber famous she lived home her papa mama. Mr. Micawber told us, he heard her sing first one, first occasion his seeing her beneath parental roof, she attracted his attention extraordinary degree; came Little Tafflin, he resolved win woman perish attempt. It ten eleven of the clock Mrs. Micawber rose replace her cap whitey-brown paper parcel, put her bonnet. Mr. Micawber took opportunity Traddles putting his great-coat, slip letter hand, whispered request I would read leisure. I also took opportunity holding candle banisters light down, Mr. Micawber going first, leading Mrs. Micawber, Traddles following cap, detain Traddles moment top stairs. ‘Traddles,’ said I, ‘Mr. Micawber do not mean harm, poor fellow: but, I you, I would not lend anything.’ ‘My dear Copperfield,’ returned Traddles, smiling, ‘I have not got anything lend.’ ‘You got name, know,’ said I. ‘Oh! You call THAT something lend?’ returned Traddles, thoughtful look. ‘Certainly.’ ‘Oh!’ said Traddles. ‘Yes, sure! I much obliged you, Copperfield; but--I afraid I lent already.’ ‘For bill certain investment?’ I inquired. ‘No,’ said Traddles. ‘Not one. This first I heard one. I thinking he likely propose one, way home. Mine’s another.’ ‘I hope nothing wrong it,’ said I. ‘I hope not,’ said Traddles. ‘I think not, though, he told me, day, provided for. That Mr. Micawber’s expression, “Provided for.”’ Mr. Micawber looking juncture standing, I time repeat caution. Traddles thanked me, descended. But I much afraid, I observed good-natured manner he went cap his hand, gave Mrs. Micawber his arm, he would carried Money Market neck heels. I returned fireside, musing, half gravely half laughing, character Mr. Micawber old relations us, I heard quick step ascending stairs. At first, I thought Traddles coming back something Mrs. Micawber left behind; step approached, I knew it, felt heart beat high, blood rush face, Steerforth’s. I never unmindful Agnes, she never left sanctuary thoughts--if I may call so--where I placed her first. But he entered, stood his hand out, darkness fallen changed light, I felt confounded ashamed doubted one I loved heartily. I loved her none less; I thought her benignant, gentle angel life; I reproached myself, her, done injury; I would made atonement I known make, make it. ‘Why, Daisy, old boy, dumb-foundered!’ laughed Steerforth, shaking hand heartily, throwing gaily away. ‘Have I detected another feast, Sybarite! These Doctors’ Commons fellows gayest men town, I believe, beat us sober Oxford people nothing!’ His bright glance went merrily round room, he took seat sofa opposite me, Mrs. Micawber recently vacated, stirred fire blaze. ‘I surprised first,’ said I, giving welcome cordiality I felt, ‘that I hardly breath greet with, Steerforth.’ ‘Well, sight good sore eyes, Scotch say,’ replied Steerforth, ‘and sight you, Daisy, full bloom. How you, Bacchanal?’ ‘I well,’ said I; ‘and Bacchanalian tonight, though I confess another party three.’ ‘All I met street, talking loud praise,’ returned Steerforth. ‘Who is friend tights?’ I gave best idea I could, words, Mr. Micawber. He laughed heartily feeble portrait gentleman, said he man know, he must know him. ‘But suppose friend is?’ said I, turn. ‘Heaven knows,’ said Steerforth. ‘Not bore, I hope? I thought he looked little like one.’ ‘Traddles!’ I replied, triumphantly. ‘Who is he?’ asked Steerforth, his careless way. ‘Do not remember Traddles? Traddles room Salem House?’ ‘Oh! That fellow!’ said Steerforth, beating lump coal top fire, poker. ‘Is he soft ever? And deuce pick up?’ I extolled Traddles reply, highly I could; I felt Steerforth rather slighted him. Steerforth, dismissing subject light nod, smile, remark he would glad see old fellow too, he always odd fish, inquired I could give anything eat? During short dialogue, he speaking wild vivacious manner, he sat idly beating lump coal poker. I observed he thing I getting remains pigeon-pie, forth. ‘Why, Daisy, here is supper king!’ he exclaimed, starting his silence burst, taking his seat table. ‘I shall justice, I come Yarmouth.’ ‘I thought came Oxford?’ I returned. ‘Not I,’ said Steerforth. ‘I seafaring--better employed.’ ‘Littimer today, inquire you,’ I remarked, ‘and I understood Oxford; though, I think it, he certainly say so.’ ‘Littimer greater fool I thought him, inquiring all,’ said Steerforth, jovially pouring glass wine, drinking me. ‘As understanding him, cleverer fellow us, Daisy, that.’ ‘That is true, indeed,’ said I, moving chair table. ‘So Yarmouth, Steerforth!’ interested know it. ‘Have long?’ ‘No,’ he returned. ‘An escapade week so.’ ‘And all? Of course, little Emily married yet?’ ‘Not yet. Going be, I believe--in many weeks, months, something other. I seen much ‘them. By by’; he laid his knife fork, he using great diligence, began feeling his pockets; ‘I letter you.’ ‘From whom?’ ‘Why, old nurse,’ he returned, taking papers his breast pocket. “‘J. Steerforth, Esquire, debtor, The Willing Mind”; that is it. Patience, we will find presently. Old what is-his-name’s bad way, it is that, I believe.’ ‘Barkis, mean?’ ‘Yes!’ still feeling his pockets, looking contents: ‘it is poor Barkis, I afraid. I saw little apothecary there--surgeon, whatever he is--who brought worship world. He mighty learned case, me; upshot his opinion was, carrier making his last journey rather fast.---Put hand breast pocket great-coat chair yonder, I think you will find letter. Is there?’ ‘Here is!’ said I. ‘That is right!’ It Peggotty; something less legible usual, brief. It informed her husband’s hopeless state, hinted his ‘a little nearer’ heretofore, consequently difficult manage his comfort. It said nothing her weariness watching, praised highly. It written plain, unaffected, homely piety I knew genuine, ended ‘my duty ever darling’--meaning myself. While I deciphered it, Steerforth continued eat drink. ‘It is bad job,’ he said, I done; ‘but sun sets every day, people die every minute, must not scared common lot. If failed hold own, equal foot men’s doors heard knocking somewhere, every object world would slip us. No! Ride on! Rough-shod need be, smooth-shod do, ride on! Ride obstacles, win race!’ ‘And win race?’ said I. ‘The race one started in,’ said he. ‘Ride on!’ I noticed, I remember, he paused, looking his handsome head little thrown back, his glass raised his hand, that, though freshness sea-wind his face, ruddy, traces it, made since I last saw it, he applied habitual strain fervent energy which, roused, passionately roused within him. I thoughts remonstrate upon his desperate way pursuing fancy he took--such buffeting rough seas, braving hard weather, example--when mind glanced immediate subject conversation again, pursued instead. ‘I tell what, Steerforth,’ said I, ‘if high spirits listen me--’ ‘They potent spirits, whatever like,’ he answered, moving table fireside again. ‘Then I tell what, Steerforth. I think I go see old nurse. It I her good, render her real service; she attached visit much effect her, I could both. She take kindly comfort support her. It great effort make, I sure, friend she me. Would not go day’s journey, place?’ His face thoughtful, he sat considering little he answered, low voice, ‘Well! Go. You harm.’ ‘You come back,’ said I, ‘and would vain ask go me?’ ‘Quite,’ he returned. ‘I Highgate tonight. I seen mother long time, lies upon conscience, it is something loved she loves her prodigal son.---Bah! Nonsense!--You mean go tomorrow, I suppose?’ he said, holding arm’s length, hand shoulders. ‘Yes, I think so.’ ‘Well, then, do not go till next day. I wanted come stay days us. Here I am, purpose bid you, fly Yarmouth!’ ‘You nice fellow talk flying off, Steerforth, always running wild unknown expedition other!’ He looked moment without speaking, rejoined, still holding before, giving shake: ‘Come! Say next day, pass much tomorrow us! Who knows may meet again, else? Come! Say next day! I want stand Rosa Dartle me, keep us asunder.’ ‘Would love much, without me?’ ‘Yes; hate,’ laughed Steerforth; ‘no matter which. Come! Say next day!’ I said next day; he put his great-coat lighted his cigar, set walk home. Finding intention, I put great-coat (but light cigar, enough one while) walked far open road: dull road, then, night. He great spirits way; parted, I looked going gallantly airily homeward, I thought his saying, ‘Ride obstacles, win race!’ wished, first time, he worthy race run. I undressing room, Mr. Micawber’s letter tumbled floor. Thus reminded it, I broke seal read follows. It dated hour half dinner. I sure whether I mentioned that, Mr. Micawber particularly desperate crisis, he used sort legal phraseology, he seemed think equivalent winding his affairs. ‘SIR--for I dare say dear Copperfield, ‘It expedient I inform undersigned Crushed.

CHAPTER 29. I VISIT STEERFORTH AT HIS HOME, AGAIN I mentioned Mr. Spenlow morning, I wanted leave absence short time; I receipt salary, consequently obnoxious implacable Jorkins, difficulty it. I took opportunity, voice sticking throat, sight failing I uttered words, express hope Miss Spenlow quite well; Mr. Spenlow replied, emotion he speaking ordinary human being, he much obliged me, she well. We articled clerks, germs patrician order proctors, treated much consideration, I almost master times. As I care, however, get Highgate one two of the clock day, another little excommunication case court morning, called The office judge promoted Tipkins Bullock his soul’s correction, I passed hour two attendance Mr. Spenlow agreeably. It arose scuffle two churchwardens, one alleged pushed pump; handle pump projecting school-house, school-house gable church-roof, made push ecclesiastical offence. It amusing case; sent Highgate, box stage-coach, thinking Commons, Mr. Spenlow said touching Commons bringing country. Mrs. Steerforth pleased see me, Rosa Dartle. I agreeably surprised find Littimer there, attended modest little parlour-maid, blue ribbons her cap, whose eye much pleasant, much less disconcerting, catch accident, eye respectable man. But I particularly observed, I half-an-hour house, close attentive watch Miss Dartle kept upon me; lurking manner she seemed compare face Steerforth’s, Steerforth’s mine, lie wait something come two. So surely I looked towards her, I see eager visage, gaunt black eyes searching brow, intent mine; passing suddenly mine Steerforth’s; comprehending us once. In lynx-like scrutiny she far faltering she saw I observed it, time she fixed her piercing look upon intent expression still. Blameless I was, knew I was, reference wrong she could possibly suspect of, I shrunk her strange eyes, quite unable endure hungry lustre. All day, she seemed pervade whole house. If I talked Steerforth his room, I heard her dress rustle little gallery outside. When he I engaged old exercises lawn behind house, I saw her face pass window window, like wandering light, fixed one, watched us. When four went walking afternoon, she closed her thin hand arm like spring, keep back, Steerforth his mother went hearing: spoke me. ‘You long time,’ she said, ‘without coming here. Is profession really engaging interesting absorb whole attention? I ask I always want informed, I ignorant. Is really, though?’ I replied I liked well enough, I certainly could claim much it. ‘Oh! I glad know that, I always like put right I wrong,’ said Rosa Dartle. ‘You mean little dry, perhaps?’ ‘Well,’ I replied; ‘perhaps little dry.’ ‘Oh! that is reason want relief change--excitement that?’ said she. ‘Ah! true! But is not little--Eh?--for him; I do not mean you?’ A quick glance her eye towards spot Steerforth walking, his mother leaning his arm, showed she meant; beyond that, I quite lost. And I looked so, I doubt. ‘Do not it--I do not say does, mind I want know--do not rather engross him? Do not make him, perhaps, little remiss usual his visits his blindly-doting--eh?’ With another quick glance them, glance seemed look innermost thoughts. ‘Miss Dartle,’ I returned, ‘pray think--’ ‘I do not!’ she said. ‘Oh dear me, do not suppose I think anything! I suspicious. I ask question. I do not state opinion. I want found opinion tell me. Then, it is so? Well! I glad know it.’ ‘It certainly fact,’ said I, perplexed, ‘that I accountable Steerforth’s away home longer usual--if he been: I really do not know moment, unless I understand you. I seen long while, last night.’ ‘No?’ ‘Indeed, Miss Dartle, no!’ As she looked full me, I saw her face grow sharper paler, marks old wound lengthen cut disfigured lip, deep nether lip, slanted face. There something positively awful this, brightness her eyes, she said, looking fixedly me: ‘What he doing?’ I repeated words, her, amazed. ‘What he doing?’ she said, eagerness seemed enough consume her like fire. ‘In man assisting him, never looks without inscrutable falsehood his eyes? If honourable faithful, I do not ask betray friend. I ask tell me, anger, hatred, pride, restlessness, wild fancy, love, it, leading him?’ ‘Miss Dartle,’ I returned, ‘how shall I tell you, believe me, I know nothing Steerforth different I first came here? I think nothing. I firmly believe nothing. I hardly understand even mean.’ As she still stood looking fixedly me, twitching throbbing, I could dissociate idea pain, came cruel mark; lifted corner her lip scorn, pity despised object. She put her hand upon hurriedly--a hand thin delicate, I seen her hold fire shade her face, I compared thoughts fine porcelain--and saying, quick, fierce, passionate way, ‘I swear secrecy this!’ said word more. Mrs. Steerforth particularly happy her son’s society, Steerforth was, occasion, particularly attentive respectful her. It interesting see together, account mutual affection, strong personal resemblance them, manner haughty impetuous softened age sex, her, gracious dignity. I thought, once, well serious division ever come them; two natures--I ought rather express it, two shades nature--might harder reconcile two extremest opposites creation. The idea originate discernment, I bound confess, speech Rosa Dartle’s. She said dinner: ‘Oh, tell me, though, somebody, I thinking day, I want know.’ ‘You want know what, Rosa?’ returned Mrs. Steerforth. ‘Pray, pray, Rosa, mysterious.’ ‘Mysterious!’ she cried. ‘Oh! really? Do consider so?’ ‘Do I constantly entreat you,’ said Mrs. Steerforth, ‘to speak plainly, natural manner?’ ‘Oh! natural manner?’ she rejoined. ‘Now must really bear me, I ask information. We never know ourselves.’ ‘It become second nature,’ said Mrs. Steerforth, without displeasure; ‘but I remember,--and must you, I think,--when manner different, Rosa; guarded, trustful.’ ‘I sure right,’ she returned; ‘and bad habits grow upon one! Really? Less guarded trustful? How I, imperceptibly, changed, I wonder! Well, that is odd! I must study regain former self.’ ‘I wish would,’ said Mrs. Steerforth, smile. ‘Oh! I really will, know!’ she answered. ‘I learn frankness from--let see--from James.’ ‘You cannot learn frankness, Rosa,’ said Mrs. Steerforth quickly--for always effect sarcasm Rosa Dartle said, though said, was, unconscious manner world--‘in better school.’ ‘That I sure of,’ she answered, uncommon fervour. ‘If I sure anything, course, know, I sure that.’ Mrs. Steerforth appeared regret little nettled; she presently said, kind tone: ‘Well, dear Rosa, heard want satisfied about?’ ‘That I want satisfied about?’ she replied, provoking coldness. ‘Oh! It whether people, like moral constitution--is phrase?’ ‘It is good phrase another,’ said Steerforth. ‘Thank you:--whether people, like moral constitution, greater danger people circumstanced, supposing serious variance arise them, divided angrily deeply?’ ‘I say yes,’ said Steerforth. ‘Should you?’ she retorted. ‘Dear me! Supposing then, instance--any unlikely thing supposition--that mother serious quarrel.’ ‘My dear Rosa,’ interposed Mrs. Steerforth, laughing good-naturedly, ‘suggest supposition! James I know duty better, I pray Heaven!’ ‘Oh!’ said Miss Dartle, nodding her head thoughtfully. ‘To sure. That would prevent it? Why, course would. Exactly. Now, I glad I foolish put case, good know duty would prevent it! Thank much.’ One little circumstance connected Miss Dartle I must omit; I reason remember thereafter, irremediable past rendered plain. During whole day, especially period it, Steerforth exerted his utmost skill, his utmost ease, charm singular creature pleasant pleased companion. That he succeed, matter surprise me. That she struggle fascinating influence his delightful art--delightful nature I thought then--did surprise either; I knew she sometimes jaundiced perverse. I saw her features her manner slowly change; I saw her look growing admiration; I saw her try, faintly, always angrily, she condemned weakness herself, resist captivating power he possessed; finally, I saw her sharp glance soften, her smile become quite gentle, I ceased afraid her I really day, sat fire, talking laughing together, little reserve children. Whether sat long, Steerforth resolved lose advantage he gained, I know; remain dining-room five minutes her departure. ‘She playing her harp,’ said Steerforth, softly, drawing-room door, ‘and nobody mother heard her that, I believe, three years.’ He said curious smile, gone directly; went room found her alone. ‘Do not get up,’ said Steerforth (which she already done)’ dear Rosa, do not! Be kind once, sing us Irish song.’ ‘What care Irish song?’ she returned. ‘Much!’ said Steerforth. ‘Much other. Here Daisy, too, loves music his soul. Sing us Irish song, Rosa! let sit listen I used do.’ He touch her, chair she risen, sat near harp. She stood beside little while, curious way, going motion playing her right hand, sounding it. At length she sat down, drew her one sudden action, played sang. I do not know was, her touch voice, made song unearthly I ever heard life, imagine. There something fearful reality it. It never written, set music, sprung passion within her; found imperfect utterance low sounds her voice, crouched still. I dumb she leaned beside harp again, playing it, sounding it, her right hand. A minute more, roused trance:--Steerforth left his seat, gone her, put his arm laughingly her, said, ‘Come, Rosa, future love much!’ And she struck him, thrown fury wild cat, burst room. ‘What matter Rosa?’ said Mrs. Steerforth, coming in. ‘She angel, mother,’ returned Steerforth, ‘for little while; run opposite extreme, since, way compensation.’ ‘You careful irritate her, James. Her temper soured, remember, ought tried.’ Rosa come back; mention made her, I went Steerforth his room say Good night. Then he laughed her, asked I ever seen fierce little piece incomprehensibility. I expressed much astonishment capable expression, asked he could guess she taken much amiss, suddenly. ‘Oh, Heaven knows,’ said Steerforth. ‘Anything like--or nothing! I told she took everything, herself included, grindstone, sharpened it. She edge-tool, requires great care dealing with. She always dangerous. Good night!’ ‘Good night!’ said I, ‘my dear Steerforth! I shall gone wake morning. Good night!’ He unwilling let go; stood, holding out, hand shoulders, he done room. ‘Daisy,’ he said, smile--‘for though that is name godfathers godmothers gave you, it is name I like best call by--and I wish, I wish, I wish, could give me!’ ‘Why I can, I choose,’ said I. ‘Daisy, anything ever separate us, must think best, old boy. Come! Let us make bargain. Think best, circumstances ever part us!’ ‘You best me, Steerforth,’ said I, ‘and worst. You always equally loved, cherished heart.’ So much compunction ever wronged him, even shapeless thought, I feel within me, confession done rising lips. But reluctance I betray confidence Agnes, uncertainty approach subject risk so, would reached he said, ‘God bless you, Daisy, good night!’ In doubt, NOT reach them; shook hands, parted. I dull dawn, and, dressed quietly I could, looked his room. He fast asleep; lying, easily, his head upon his arm, I often seen lie school. The time came season, soon, I almost wondered nothing troubled his repose, I looked him. But he slept--let think again--as I often seen sleep school; thus, silent hour, I left him. --Never more, oh God forgive you, Steerforth! touch passive hand love friendship. Never, never more! CHAPTER 30. A LOSS I got Yarmouth evening, went inn. I knew Peggotty’s spare room--my room--was likely occupation enough little while, great Visitor, whose presence living must give place, already house; I betook inn, dined there, engaged bed. It ten of the clock I went out. Many shops shut, town dull. When I came Omer Joram’s, I found shutters up, shop door standing open. As I could obtain perspective view Mr. Omer inside, smoking his pipe parlour door, I entered, asked he was. ‘Why, bless life soul!’ said Mr. Omer, ‘how find yourself? Take seat.---Smoke disagreeable, I hope?’ ‘By means,’ said I. ‘I like it--in somebody else’s pipe.’ ‘What, own, eh?’ Mr. Omer returned, laughing. ‘All better, sir. Bad habit young man. Take seat. I smoke, myself, asthma.’ Mr. Omer made room me, placed chair. He sat much breath, gasping his pipe contained supply necessary, without he must perish. ‘I sorry heard bad news Mr. Barkis,’ said I. Mr. Omer looked me, steady countenance, shook his head. ‘Do know he tonight?’ I asked. ‘The question I put you, sir,’ returned Mr. Omer, ‘but account delicacy. It is one drawbacks line business. When party’s ill, cannot ask party is.’ The difficulty occurred me; though I apprehensions too, I went in, hearing old tune. On mentioned, I recognized it, however, said much. ‘Yes, yes, understand,’ said Mr. Omer, nodding his head. ‘We dursn’t it. Bless you, would shock generality parties might not recover, say “Omer Joram’s compliments, find morning?”--or afternoon--as may be.’ Mr. Omer I nodded other, Mr. Omer recruited his wind aid his pipe. ‘It is one things cut trade attentions could often wish show,’ said Mr. Omer. ‘Take myself. If I known Barkis year, move he went by, I known forty years. But I cannot go say, “how he?”’ I felt rather hard Mr. Omer, I told so. ‘I am self-interested, I hope, another man,’ said Mr. Omer. ‘Look me! My wind may fail moment, are not likely that, knowledge, I would self-interested circumstances. I say are not likely, man knows his wind go, DOES go, pair bellows cut open; man grandfather,’ said Mr. Omer. I said, ‘Not all.’ ‘It are not I complain line business,’ said Mr. Omer. ‘It are not that. Some good bad goes, doubt, callings. What I wish is, parties brought stronger-minded.’ Mr. Omer, complacent amiable face, took several puffs silence; said, resuming his first point: ‘Accordingly we are obleeged, ascertaining Barkis goes on, limit Them’ly. She knows real objects are, she do not alarms suspicions us, many lambs. Minnie Joram stepped house, fact (she is there, hours, helping her aunt bit), ask her he tonight; please wait till come back, they would give full partic’lers. Will take something? A glass srub water, now? I smoke srub water, myself,’ said Mr. Omer, taking his glass, ‘because it is considered softening passages, troublesome breath mine gets action. But, Lord bless you,’ said Mr. Omer, huskily, ‘it are not passages that is order! “Give breath enough,” said I daughter Minnie, “and I will find passages, dear.”’ He really breath spare, alarming see laugh. When he condition talked to, I thanked proffered refreshment, I declined, I dinner; and, observing I would wait, since he good invite me, his daughter his son-in-law came back, I inquired little Emily was? ‘Well, sir,’ said Mr. Omer, removing his pipe, he might rub his chin: ‘I tell truly, I shall glad her marriage taken place.’ ‘Why so?’ I inquired. ‘Well, she is unsettled present,’ said Mr. Omer. ‘It are not she is pretty ever, she is prettier--I assure you, she prettier. It are not she do not work well ever, she does. She WAS worth six, she IS worth six. But somehow she wants heart. If understand,’ said Mr. Omer, rubbing his chin again, smoking little, ‘what I mean general way expression, “A long pull, strong pull, pull altogether, hearties, hurrah!” I say you, was--in general way--what I miss Them’ly.’ Mr. Omer’s face manner went much, I could conscientiously nod head, divining his meaning. My quickness apprehension seemed please him, he went on: ‘Now I consider principally account her unsettled state, see. We talked good deal, her uncle myself, her sweetheart myself, business; I consider principally account her unsettled. You must always recollect Them’ly,’ said Mr. Omer, shaking his head gently, ‘that she is extraordinary affectionate little thing. The proverb says, “You cannot make silk purse sow’s ear.” Well, I do not know that. I rather think may, begin early life. She made home old boat, sir, stone marble could not beat.’ ‘I sure she has!’ said I. ‘To see clinging pretty little thing her uncle,’ said Mr. Omer; ‘to see way she holds him, tighter tighter, closer closer, every day, see sight. Now, know, there is struggle going that is case. Why made longer one needful?’ I listened attentively good old fellow, acquiesced, heart, he said. ‘Therefore, I mentioned them,’ said Mr. Omer, comfortable, easy-going tone, ‘this. I said, “Now, do not consider Them’ly nailed point time, all. Make time. Her services valuable supposed; her learning quicker supposed; Omer Joram run pen remains; she is free wish. If she likes make little arrangement, afterwards, way little thing us home, well. If she do not, well still. We are losers, anyhow.” For--do not see,’ said Mr. Omer, touching his pipe, ‘it are not likely man short breath myself, grandfather too, would go strain points little bit blue-eyed blossom, like her?’ ‘Not all, I certain,’ said I. ‘Not all! You are right!’ said Mr. Omer. ‘Well, sir, her cousin--you know it is cousin she is going married to?’ ‘Oh yes,’ I replied. ‘I know well.’ ‘Of course do,’ said Mr. Omer. ‘Well, sir! Her cousin being, appears, good work, well do, thanked manly sort manner (conducting altogether, I must say, way gives high opinion him), went took comfortable little house I could wish clap eyes on. That little house furnished right through, neat complete doll’s parlour; Barkis’s illness taken bad turn, poor fellow, would man wife--I dare say, time. As is, there is postponement.’ ‘And Emily, Mr. Omer?’ I inquired. ‘Has she become settled?’ ‘Why that, know,’ he returned, rubbing his double chin again, ‘cannot naturally expected. The prospect change separation, that, is, one may say, close her far away her, once. Barkis’s death need not put much, his lingering might. Anyway, it is uncertain state matters, see.’ ‘I see,’ said I. ‘Consequently,’ pursued Mr. Omer, ‘Them’ly’s still little down, little fluttered; perhaps, upon whole, she is she was. Every day she seems get fonder fonder her uncle, loth part us. A kind word brings tears her eyes; see her daughter Minnie’s little girl, you would never forget it. Bless heart alive!’ said Mr. Omer, pondering, ‘how she loves child!’ Having favourable opportunity, occurred ask Mr. Omer, conversation interrupted return his daughter her husband, whether he knew anything Martha. ‘Ah!’ he rejoined, shaking his head, looking much dejected. ‘No good. A sad story, sir, however come know it. I never thought harm girl. I would not wish mention daughter Minnie--for she would take directly--but I never did. None us ever did.’ Mr. Omer, hearing his daughter’s footstep I heard it, touched his pipe, shut one eye, caution. She her husband came immediately afterwards. Their report was, Mr. Barkis ‘as bad bad could be’; he quite unconscious; Mr. Chillip mournfully said kitchen, going away now, College Physicians, College Surgeons, Apothecaries’ Hall, called together, could not help him. He past Colleges, Mr. Chillip said, Hall could poison him. Hearing this, learning Mr. Peggotty there, I determined go house once. I bade good night Mr. Omer, Mr. Mrs. Joram; directed steps thither, solemn feeling, made Mr. Barkis quite new different creature. My low tap door answered Mr. Peggotty. He much surprised see I expected. I remarked Peggotty, too, she came down; I seen since; I think, expectation dread surprise, changes surprises dwindle nothing. I shook hands Mr. Peggotty, passed kitchen, he softly closed door. Little Emily sitting fire, her hands her face. Ham standing near her. We spoke whispers; listening, whiles, sound room above. I thought occasion last visit, strange me, now, miss Mr. Barkis kitchen! ‘This kind you, Mas’r Davy,’ said Mr. Peggotty. ‘It is oncommon kind,’ said Ham. ‘Them’ly, dear,’ cried Mr. Peggotty. ‘See here! Here is Mas’r Davy come! What, cheer up, pretty! Not wured Mas’r Davy?’ There trembling upon her, I see now. The coldness her hand I touched it, I feel yet. Its sign animation shrink mine; she glided chair, creeping side her uncle, bowed herself, silently trembling still, upon his breast. ‘It is loving art,’ said Mr. Peggotty, smoothing her rich hair his great hard hand, ‘that cannot abear sorrer this. It is nat’ral young folk, Mas’r Davy, they are new trials, timid, like little bird,--it is nat’ral.’ She clung closer him, neither lifted her face, spoke word. ‘It is getting late, dear,’ said Mr. Peggotty, ‘and here is Ham come fur take home. Theer! Go along t’other loving art! What’ Them’ly? Eh, pretty?’ The sound her voice reached me, he bent his head he listened her, said: ‘Let stay uncle? Why, doen’t mean ask that! Stay uncle, Moppet? When husband that will soon, fur take home? Now person would not think it, fur see little thing alongside rough-weather chap like me,’ said Mr. Peggotty, looking round us, infinite pride; ‘but sea are not salt she fondness her her uncle--a foolish little Them’ly!’ ‘Them’ly’s right that, Mas’r Davy!’ said Ham. ‘Lookee here! As Them’ly wishes it, she is hurried frightened, like, besides, I will leave her till morning. Let stay too!’ ‘No, no,’ said Mr. Peggotty. ‘You doen’t ought--a married man like you--or what is good--to take hull away day’s work. And doen’t ought watch work both. That will not do. You go home turn in. You are not afeerd Them’ly took good care on, I know.’ Ham yielded persuasion, took his hat go. Even he kissed her--and I never saw approach her, I felt nature given soul gentleman--she seemed cling closer her uncle, even avoidance her chosen husband. I shut door him, might disturbance quiet prevailed; I turned back, I found Mr. Peggotty still talking her. ‘Now, I am going upstairs tell aunt Mas’r Davy’s here, that will cheer her bit,’ he said. ‘Sit ye fire, while, dear, warm mortal cold hands. You doen’t need fearsome, take much. What? You will go along me?--Well! come along me--come! If her uncle turned house home, forced lay dyke, Mas’r Davy,’ said Mr. Peggotty, less pride before, ‘it is belief she would go along him, now! But there will someone else, soon,--someone else, soon, Them’ly!’ Afterwards, I went upstairs, I passed door little chamber, dark, I indistinct impression her within it, cast upon floor. But, whether really she, whether confusion shadows room, I do not know now. I leisure think, kitchen fire, pretty little Emily’s dread death--which, added Mr. Omer told me, I took her unlike herself--and I leisure, Peggotty came down, even think leniently weakness it: I sat counting ticking clock, deepening sense solemn hush around me. Peggotty took her arms, blessed thanked comfort her (that she said) her distress. She entreated come upstairs, sobbing Mr. Barkis always liked admired me; he often talked me, he fell stupor; she believed, case his coming again, he would brighten sight me, he could brighten earthly thing. The probability his ever so, appeared me, I saw him, small. He lying his head shoulders bed, uncomfortable attitude, half resting box cost much pain trouble. I learned, that, he past creeping bed open it, past assuring safety means divining rod I seen use, he required placed chair bed-side, he ever since embraced it, night day. His arm lay now. Time world slipping beneath him, box there; last words he uttered (in explanatory tone) ‘Old clothes!’ ‘Barkis, dear!’ said Peggotty, almost cheerfully: bending him, her brother I stood bed’s foot. ‘Here is dear boy--my dear boy, Master Davy, brought us together, Barkis! That sent messages by, know! Will not speak Master Davy?’ He mute senseless box, his form derived expression had. ‘He is going tide,’ said Mr. Peggotty me, behind his hand. My eyes dim Mr. Peggotty’s; I repeated whisper, ‘With tide?’ ‘People cannot die, along coast,’ said Mr. Peggotty, ‘except tide’s pretty nigh out. They cannot born, unless it is pretty nigh in--not properly born, till flood. He is going tide. It is ebb half-arter three, slack water half hour. If he lives till turns, he will hold his till past flood, go next tide.’ We remained there, watching him, long time--hours. What mysterious influence presence upon state his senses, I shall pretend say; he last began wander feebly, certain he muttering driving school. ‘He is coming himself,’ said Peggotty. Mr. Peggotty touched me, whispered much awe reverence. ‘They a-going fast.’ ‘Barkis, dear!’ said Peggotty. ‘C. P. Barkis,’ he cried faintly. ‘No better woman anywhere!’ ‘Look! Here is Master Davy!’ said Peggotty. For he opened his eyes. I point asking he knew me, he tried stretch his arm, said me, distinctly, pleasant smile: ‘Barkis willin’!’ And, low water, he went tide. CHAPTER 31. A GREATER LOSS It difficult me, Peggotty’s solicitation, resolve stay I was, remains poor carrier made last journey Blunderstone. She long ago bought, her savings, little piece ground old churchyard near grave ‘her sweet girl’, she always called mother; rest. In keeping Peggotty company, I could her (little enough utmost), I grateful, I rejoice think, even I could wish been. But I afraid I supreme satisfaction, personal professional nature, taking charge Mr. Barkis’s will, expounding contents. I may claim merit originated suggestion looked box. After search, found box, bottom horse’s nose-bag; wherein (besides hay) discovered old gold watch, chain seals, Mr. Barkis worn his wedding-day, never seen since; silver tobacco-stopper, form leg; imitation lemon, full minute cups saucers, I idea Mr. Barkis must purchased present I child, afterwards found unable part with; eighty-seven guineas half, guineas half-guineas; two hundred ten pounds, perfectly clean Bank notes; certain receipts Bank England stock; old horseshoe, bad shilling, piece camphor, oyster-she will. From circumstance latter article much polished, displaying prismatic colours inside, I conclude Mr. Barkis general ideas pearls, never resolved anything definite. For years years, Mr. Barkis carried box, his journeys, every day. That might better escape notice, he invented fiction belonged ‘Mr. Blackboy’, ‘to left Barkis till called for’; fable he elaborately written lid, characters scarcely legible. He hoarded, years, I found, good purpose. His property money amounted nearly three thousand pounds. Of he bequeathed interest one thousand Mr. Peggotty his life; his decease, principal equally divided Peggotty, little Emily, me, survivor survivors us, share share alike. All rest he died possessed of, he bequeathed Peggotty; he left residuary legatee, sole executrix his last testament. I felt quite proctor I read document aloud possible ceremony, set forth provisions, number times, concerned. I began think Commons I supposed. I examined deepest attention, pronounced perfectly formal respects, made pencil-mark margin, thought rather extraordinary I knew much. In abstruse pursuit; making account Peggotty, property she come; arranging affairs orderly manner; her referee adviser every point, joint delight; I passed week funeral. I see little Emily interval, told she quietly married fortnight. I attend funeral character, I may venture say so. I mean I dressed black coat streamer, frighten birds; I walked Blunderstone early morning, churchyard came, attended Peggotty her brother. The mad gentleman looked on, little window; Mr. Chillip’s baby wagged heavy head, rolled goggle eyes, clergyman, nurse’s shoulder; Mr. Omer breathed short background; one else there; quiet. We walked churchyard hour, over; pulled young leaves tree mother’s grave. A dread falls here. A cloud lowering distant town, towards I retraced solitary steps. I fear approach it. I cannot bear think come, upon memorable night; must come again, I go on. It worse, I write it. It would better, I stopped unwilling hand. It done. Nothing undo it; nothing make otherwise was. My old nurse go London next day, business will. Little Emily passing day Mr. Omer’s. We meet old boathouse night. Ham would bring Emily usual hour. I would walk back leisure. The brother sister would return come, expecting us, day closed in, fireside. I parted wicket-gate, visionary Strap rested Roderick Random’s knapsack days yore; and, instead going straight back, walked little distance road Lowestoft. Then I turned, walked back towards Yarmouth. I stayed dine decent alehouse, mile two Ferry I mentioned before; thus day wore away, evening I reached it. Rain falling heavily time, wild night; moon behind clouds, dark. I soon within sight Mr. Peggotty’s house, light within shining window. A little floundering across sand, heavy, brought door, I went in. It looked comfortable indeed. Mr. Peggotty smoked his evening pipe preparations supper by. The fire bright, ashes thrown up, locker ready little Emily her old place. In her old place sat Peggotty, more, looking (but her dress) she never left it. She fallen back, already, society work-box St. Paul’s upon lid, yard-measure cottage, bit wax-candle; were, never disturbed. Mrs. Gummidge appeared fretting little, her old corner; consequently looked quite natural, too. ‘You are first lot, Mas’r Davy!’ said Mr. Peggotty happy face. ‘Doen’t keep coat, sir, it is wet.’ ‘Thank you, Mr. Peggotty,’ said I, giving outer coat hang up. ‘It is quite dry.’ ‘So ‘it is!’ said Mr. Peggotty, feeling shoulders. ‘As chip! Sit ye down, sir. It are not use saying welcome you, you are welcome, kind hearty.’ ‘Thank you, Mr. Peggotty, I sure that. Well, Peggotty!’ said I, giving her kiss. ‘And you, old woman?’ ‘Ha, ha!’ laughed Mr. Peggotty, sitting beside us, rubbing his hands his sense relief recent trouble, genuine heartiness his nature; ‘there is woman wureld, sir--as I tell her--that need feel easy her mind her! She done her dooty departed, departed know’d it; departed done right her, she done right departed;--and--and--and it is right!’ Mrs. Gummidge groaned. ‘Cheer up, pritty mawther!’ said Mr. Peggotty. (But he shook his head aside us, evidently sensible tendency late occurrences recall memory old one.) ‘Doen’t down! Cheer up, self, on’y little bit, see good deal doen’t come nat’ral!’ ‘Not me, Dan’l,’ returned Mrs. Gummidge. ‘Nothink’s nat’ral lone lorn.’ ‘No, no,’ said Mr. Peggotty, soothing her sorrows. ‘Yes, yes, Dan’l!’ said Mrs. Gummidge. ‘I are not person live money left. Things go contrary me. I better riddance.’ ‘Why, I ever spend without you?’ said Mr. Peggotty, air serious remonstrance. ‘What talking on? Doen’t I want now, ever I did?’ ‘I know’d I never wanted before!’ cried Mrs. Gummidge, pitiable whimper, ‘and I am told so! How could I expect wanted, lone lorn, contrary!’ Mr. Peggotty seemed much shocked made speech capable unfeeling construction, prevented replying, Peggotty’s pulling his sleeve, shaking her head. After looking Mrs. Gummidge moments, sore distress mind, he glanced Dutch clock, rose, snuffed candle, put window. ‘Theer!’ said Mr. Peggotty, cheerily. ‘Theer are, Missis Gummidge!’ Mrs. Gummidge slightly groaned. ‘Lighted up, accordin’ custom! You are wonderin’ that is fur, sir! Well, it is fur little Them’ly. You see, path are not light cheerful arter dark; I am hour she is comin’ home, I puts light winder. That, see,’ said Mr. Peggotty, bending great glee, ‘meets two objects. She says, says Them’ly, “Theer’s home!” she says. And likewise, says Them’ly, “My uncle’s theer!” Fur I are not theer, I never light showed.’ ‘You are baby!’ said Peggotty; fond it, she thought so. ‘Well,’ returned Mr. Peggotty, standing his legs pretty wide apart, rubbing his hands his comfortable satisfaction, he looked alternately us fire. ‘I doen’t know I am. Not, see, look at.’ ‘Not azackly,’ observed Peggotty. ‘No,’ laughed Mr. Peggotty, ‘not look at, to--to consider on, know. I doen’t care, bless you! Now I tell you. When I go looking looking theer pritty house Them’ly’s, I am--I am Gormed,’ said Mr. Peggotty, sudden emphasis--‘theer! I cannot say more--if I doen’t feel littlest things her, a’most. I takes ‘them I put ‘them down, I touches ‘them delicate Them’ly. So ‘it is her little bonnets that. I could not see one ‘them rough used purpose--not fur whole wureld. There is babby fur you, form great Sea Porkypine!’ said Mr. Peggotty, relieving his earnestness roar laughter. Peggotty I laughed, loud. ‘It is opinion, see,’ said Mr. Peggotty, delighted face, rubbing his legs, ‘as along played her much, made believe Turks, French, sharks, every wariety forinners--bless you, yes; lions whales, I doen’t know all!--when she warn’t higher knee. I have got way it, know. Why, candle, now!’ said Mr. Peggotty, gleefully holding his hand towards it, ‘I know wery well arter she is married gone, I shall put candle theer, now. I know wery well I am nights (and else I live, bless arts, whatever fortun’ I come into!) she are not I are not theer, I shall put candle winder, sit afore fire, pretending I am expecting her, like I am now. THERE IS babby you,’ said Mr. Peggotty, another roar, ‘in form Sea Porkypine! Why, present minute, I see candle sparkle up, I says myself, “She is looking it! Them’ly’s coming!” THERE IS babby you, form Sea Porkypine! Right that,’ said Mr. Peggotty, stopping his roar, smiting his hands together; ‘fur she is!’ It Ham. The night turned wet since I came in, he large sou’wester hat on, slouched his face. ‘Wheer’s Them’ly?’ said Mr. Peggotty. Ham made motion his head, she outside. Mr. Peggotty took light window, trimmed it, put table, busily stirring fire, Ham, moved, said: ‘Mas’r Davy, come minute, see Them’ly got show you?’ We went out. As I passed door, I saw, astonishment fright, he deadly pale. He pushed hastily open air, closed door upon us. Only upon us two. ‘Ham! what is matter?’ ‘Mas’r Davy!--’ Oh, his broken heart, dreadfully he wept! I paralysed sight grief. I do not know I thought, I dreaded. I could look him. ‘Ham! Poor good fellow! For Heaven’s sake, tell what is matter!’ ‘My love, Mas’r Davy--the pride hope art--her I would died for, would die now--she is gone!’ ‘Gone!’ ‘Them’ly’s run away! Oh, Mas’r Davy, think HOW she is run away, I pray good gracious God kill her (her dear things) sooner let her come ruin disgrace!’ The face he turned troubled sky, quivering his clasped hands, agony his figure, remain associated lonely waste, remembrance, hour. It always night there, he object scene. ‘You are scholar,’ he said, hurriedly, ‘and know what is right best. What I say, indoors? How I ever break him, Mas’r Davy?’ I saw door move, instinctively tried hold latch outside, gain moment’s time. It late. Mr. Peggotty thrust forth his face; never could I forget change came upon he saw us, I live five hundred years. I remember great wail cry, women hanging him, standing room; I paper hand, Ham given me; Mr. Peggotty, his vest torn open, his hair wild, his face lips quite white, blood trickling his bosom (it sprung his mouth, I think), looking fixedly me. ‘Read it, sir,’ he said, low shivering voice. ‘Slow, please. I doen’t know I understand.’ In midst silence death, I read thus, blotted letter: ‘“When you, love much better I ever deserved, even mind innocent, see this, I shall far away.”’ ‘I shall fur away,’ he repeated slowly. ‘Stop! Them’ly fur away. Well!’ ‘“When I leave dear home--my dear home--oh, dear home!--in morning,”’ letter bore date previous night: ’”--it never come back, unless he brings back lady. This found night, many hours after, instead me. Oh, knew heart torn. If even you, I wronged much, never forgive me, could know I suffer! I wicked write myself! Oh, take comfort thinking I bad. Oh, mercy’s sake, tell uncle I never loved half dear now. Oh, do not remember affectionate kind me--do not remember ever married--but try think I died I little, buried somewhere. Pray Heaven I going away from, compassion uncle! Tell I never loved half dear. Be his comfort. Love good girl I uncle, true you, worthy you, know shame me. God bless all! I will pray all, often, knees. If he do not bring back lady, I do not pray self, I will pray all. My parting love uncle. My last tears, last thanks, uncle!”’ That all. He stood, long I ceased read, still looking me. At length I ventured take his hand, entreat him, well I could, endeavour get command himself. He replied, ‘I thankee, sir, I thankee!’ without moving. Ham spoke him. Mr. Peggotty far sensible HIS affliction, he wrung his hand; but, otherwise, he remained state, one dared disturb him. Slowly, last, he moved his eyes face, he waking vision, cast round room. Then he said, low voice: ‘Who is man? I want know his name.’ Ham glanced me, suddenly I felt shock struck back. ‘There is man suspected,’ said Mr. Peggotty. ‘Who it?’ ‘Mas’r Davy!’ implored Ham. ‘Go bit, let tell I must. You doen’t ought hear it, sir.’ I felt shock again. I sank chair, tried utter reply; tongue fettered, sight weak. ‘I want know his name!’ I heard said more. ‘For time past,’ Ham faltered, ‘there is servant here, odd times. There is gen’lm’n too. Both ‘them belonged one another.’ Mr. Peggotty stood fixed before, looking him. ‘The servant,’ pursued Ham, ‘was seen along with--our poor girl--last night. He is hiding here, week over. He thought gone, he hiding. Doen’t stay, Mas’r Davy, doen’t!’ I felt Peggotty’s arm round neck, I could moved house fall upon me. ‘A strange chay hosses outside town, morning, Norwich road, a’most afore day broke,’ Ham went on. ‘The servant went it, come it, went again. When he went again, Them’ly nigh him. The t’other inside. He is man.’ ‘For Lord’s love,’ said Mr. Peggotty, falling back, putting his hand, keep he dreaded. ‘Doen’t tell his name’s Steerforth!’ ‘Mas’r Davy,’ exclaimed Ham, broken voice, ‘it are not fault yourn--and I far laying you--but his name Steerforth, he is damned villain!’ Mr. Peggotty uttered cry, she would tear, moved more, he seemed wake again, once, pulled his rough coat peg corner. ‘Bear hand this! I am struck heap, cannot it,’ he said, impatiently. ‘Bear hand help me. Well!’ somebody done so. ‘Now give theer hat!’ Ham asked whither he going. ‘I am going seek niece. I am going seek Them’ly. I am going, first, stave theer boat, sink I would drownded him, I am living soul, I one thought him! As he sat afore me,’ he said, wildly, holding his clenched right hand, ‘as he sat afore me, face face, strike dead, I would drownded him, thought right!--I am going seek niece.’ ‘Where?’ cried Ham, interposing door. ‘Anywhere! I am going seek niece wureld. I am going find poor niece her shame, bring her back. No one stop me! I tell I am going seek niece!’ ‘No, no!’ cried Mrs. Gummidge, coming them, fit crying. ‘No, no, Dan’l, now. Seek her little while, lone lorn Dan’l, that will right! now. Sit ye down, give forgiveness ever worrit you, Dan’l--what contraries ever this!--and let us speak word times she first orphan, Ham too, I poor widder woman, took in. It will soften poor heart, Dan’l,’ laying her head upon his shoulder, ‘and you will bear sorrow better; know promise, Dan’l, “As done unto one least these, done unto me”,--and never fail roof, that is shelter many, many year!’ He quite passive now; I heard crying, impulse upon go upon knees, ask pardon desolation I caused, curse Steerforth, yielded better feeling. My overcharged heart found relief, I cried too. CHAPTER 32. THE BEGINNING OF A LONG JOURNEY What natural me, natural many men, I infer, I afraid write I never loved Steerforth better ties bound broken. In keen distress discovery his unworthiness, I thought brilliant him, I softened towards good him, I justice qualities might made man noble nature great name, ever I done height devotion him. Deeply I felt unconscious part his pollution honest home, I believed I brought face face him, I could uttered one reproach. I loved well still--though he fascinated longer--I held much tenderness memory affection him, I think I weak spirit-wounded child, entertainment thought could ever re-united. That thought I never had. I felt, he felt, end us. What his remembrances were, I never known--they light enough, perhaps, easily dismissed--but mine remembrances cherished friend, dead. Yes, Steerforth, long removed scenes poor history! My sorrow may bear involuntary witness judgement Throne; angry thoughts reproaches never will, I know! The news happened soon spread town; insomuch I passed along streets next morning, I overheard people speaking doors. Many hard upon her, hard upon him, towards her second father her lover one sentiment. Among kinds people respect distress prevailed, full gentleness delicacy. The seafaring men kept apart, two seen early, walking slow steps beach; stood knots, talking compassionately among themselves. It beach, close sea, I found them. It would easy perceive slept last night, even Peggotty failed tell still sitting I left them, broad day. They looked worn; I thought Mr. Peggotty’s head bowed one night years I known him. But grave steady sea itself, lying beneath dark sky, waveless--yet heavy roll upon it, breathed rest--and touched, horizon, strip silvery light unseen sun. ‘We mort talk, sir,’ said Mr. Peggotty me, three walked little silence, ‘of ought doen’t ought do. But see course now.’ I happened glance Ham, looking sea upon distant light, frightful thought came mind--not his face angry, not; I recall nothing expression stern determination it--that ever he encountered Steerforth, he would kill him. ‘My dooty here, sir,’ said Mr. Peggotty, ‘is done. I am going seek my--’ he stopped, went firmer voice: ‘I am going seek her. That is dooty evermore.’ He shook his head I asked he would seek her, inquired I going London tomorrow? I told I gone today, fearing lose chance service him; I ready go he would. ‘I will go along you, sir,’ he rejoined, ‘if you are agreeable, tomorrow.’ We walked again, while, silence. ‘Ham,’ he presently resumed, ‘he will hold his present work, go live along sister. The old boat yonder--’ ‘Will desert old boat, Mr. Peggotty?’ I gently interposed. ‘My station, Mas’r Davy,’ he returned, ‘are not longer; ever boat foundered, since darkness face deep, one’s gone down. But no, sir, no; I doen’t mean deserted. Fur that.’ We walked while, before, he explained: ‘My wishes is, sir, shall look, day night, winter summer, always looked, since she fust know’d it. If ever she come wandering back, I would not old place seem cast her off, understand, seem tempt her draw nigher ‘t, peep in, maybe, like ghost, wind rain, old winder, old seat fire. Then, maybe, Mas’r Davy, seein’ none Missis Gummidge there, she might take heart creep in, trembling; might come laid her old bed, rest her weary head gay.’ I could speak reply, though I tried. ‘Every night,’ said Mr. Peggotty, ‘as reg’lar night comes, candle must stood old pane glass, ever she see it, may seem say “Come back, child, come back!” If ever there is knock, Ham (partic’ler soft knock), arter dark, aunt’s door, doen’t go nigh it. Let her--not you--that sees fallen child!’ He walked little front us, kept us minutes. During interval, I glanced Ham again, observing expression his face, his eyes still directed distant light, I touched his arm. Twice I called his name, tone I might tried rouse sleeper, he heeded me. When I last inquired his thoughts bent, he replied: ‘On what is afore me, Mas’r Davy; yon.’ ‘On life you, mean?’ He pointed confusedly sea. ‘Ay, Mas’r Davy. I doen’t rightly know ‘it is, yon seemed come--the end like,’ looking he waking, determined face. ‘What end?’ I asked, possessed former fear. ‘I doen’t know,’ he said, thoughtfully; ‘I calling mind beginning take place here--and end come. But it is gone! Mas’r Davy,’ he added; answering, I think, look; ‘you han’t call afeerd me: I am kiender muddled; I do not fare feel matters,’--which much say he himself, quite confounded. Mr. Peggotty stopping us join him: so, said more. The remembrance this, connexion former thought, however, haunted intervals, even inexorable end came appointed time. We insensibly approached old boat, entered. Mrs. Gummidge, longer moping her especial corner, busy preparing breakfast. She took Mr. Peggotty’s hat, placed his seat him, spoke comfortably softly, I hardly knew her. ‘Dan’l, good man,’ said she, ‘you must eat drink, keep strength, without you will nowt. Try, that is dear soul! An I disturb clicketten,’ she meant her chattering, ‘tell so, Dan’l, I will not.’ When she served us all, she withdrew window, she sedulously employed herself repairing shirts clothes belonging Mr. Peggotty, neatly folding packing old oilskin bag, sailors carry. Meanwhile, she continued talking, quiet manner: ‘All times seasons, know, Dan’l,’ said Mrs. Gummidge, ‘I shall allus here, everythink look accordin’ wishes. I am poor scholar, I shall write you, odd times, you are away, send letters Mas’r Davy. Maybe you will write too, Dan’l, odd times, tell fare feel upon lone lorn journies.’ ‘You will solitary woman heer, I am afeerd!’ said Mr. Peggotty. ‘No, no, Dan’l,’ she returned, ‘I shall not that. Doen’t mind me. I shall enough keep Beein you’ (Mrs. Gummidge meant home), ‘again come back--to keep Beein may hap come back, Dan’l. In fine time, I shall set outside door I used do. If come nigh, shall see old widder woman true ‘them, long way off.’ What change Mrs. Gummidge little time! She another woman. She devoted, she quick perception would well say, would well leave unsaid; she forgetful herself, regardful sorrow her, I held her sort veneration. The work she day! There many things brought beach stored outhouse--as oars, nets, sails, cordage, spars, lobster-pots, bags ballast, like; though abundance assistance rendered, pair working hands shore would laboured hard Mr. Peggotty, well paid asked it, yet she persisted, day long, toiling weights she quite unequal to, fagging fro sorts unnecessary errands. As deploring her misfortunes, she appeared entirely lost recollection ever any. She preserved equable cheerfulness midst her sympathy, least astonishing part change come her. Querulousness question. I even observe her voice falter, tear escape her eyes, whole day through, twilight; she I Mr. Peggotty alone together, he fallen asleep perfect exhaustion, she broke half-suppressed fit sobbing crying, taking door, said, ‘Ever bless you, Mas’r Davy, friend him, poor dear!’ Then, she immediately ran house wash her face, order she might sit quietly beside him, found work there, he awake. In short I left her, I went away night, prop staff Mr. Peggotty’s affliction; I could meditate enough upon lesson I read Mrs. Gummidge, new experience she unfolded me. It nine ten of the clock when, strolling melancholy manner town, I stopped Mr. Omer’s door. Mr. Omer taken much heart, his daughter told me, he low poorly day, gone bed without his pipe. ‘A deceitful, bad-hearted girl,’ said Mrs. Joram. ‘There good her, ever!’ ‘Do not say so,’ I returned. ‘You do not think so.’ ‘Yes, I do!’ cried Mrs. Joram, angrily. ‘No, no,’ said I. Mrs. Joram tossed her head, endeavouring stern cross; she could command her softer self, began cry. I young, sure; I thought much better her sympathy, fancied became her, virtuous wife mother, well indeed. ‘What she ever do!’ sobbed Minnie. ‘Where she go! What become her! Oh, could she cruel, herself him!’ I remembered time Minnie young pretty girl; I glad she remembered too, feelingly. ‘My little Minnie,’ said Mrs. Joram, ‘has got sleep. Even her sleep she sobbing Them’ly. All day long, little Minnie cried her, asked me, again, whether Them’ly wicked? What I say her, Them’ly tied ribbon her neck round little Minnie’s last night she here, laid her head pillow beside her till she fast asleep! The ribbon’s round little Minnie’s neck now. It ought be, perhaps, I do? Them’ly bad, fond one another. And child knows nothing!’ Mrs. Joram unhappy her husband came take care her. Leaving together, I went home Peggotty’s; melancholy myself, possible, I yet. That good creature--I mean Peggotty--all untired her late anxieties sleepless nights, her brother’s, she meant stay till morning. An old woman, employed house weeks past, Peggotty unable attend it, house’s occupant besides myself. As I occasion her services, I sent her bed, means her will, sat kitchen fire little while, think this. I blending deathbed late Mr. Barkis, driving tide towards distance Ham looked singularly morning, I recalled wanderings knock door. There knocker upon door, made sound. The tap hand, low upon door, given child. It made start much knock footman person distinction. I opened door; first looked down, amazement, nothing great umbrella appeared walking itself. But presently I discovered underneath it, Miss Mowcher. I might prepared give little creature kind reception, if, her removing umbrella, her utmost efforts unable shut up, she shown ‘volatile’ expression face made great impression first last meeting. But her face, she turned mine, earnest; I relieved her umbrella (which would inconvenient one Irish Giant), she wrung her little hands afflicted manner; I rather inclined towards her. ‘Miss Mowcher!’ said I, glancing empty street, without distinctly knowing I expected see besides; ‘how come here? What matter?’ She motioned her short right arm, shut umbrella her; passing hurriedly, went kitchen. When I closed door, followed, umbrella hand, I found her sitting corner fender--it low iron one, two flat bars top stand plates upon--in shadow boiler, swaying herself backwards forwards, chafing her hands upon her knees like person pain. Quite alarmed recipient untimely visit, spectator portentous behaviour, I exclaimed again, ‘Pray tell me, Miss Mowcher, matter! ill?’ ‘My dear young soul,’ returned Miss Mowcher, squeezing her hands upon her heart one other. ‘I ill here, I ill. To think come this, I might known perhaps prevented it, I had not thoughtless fool!’ Again her large bonnet (very disproportionate figure) went backwards forwards, her swaying her little body fro; gigantic bonnet rocked, unison it, upon wall. ‘I surprised,’ I began, ‘to see distressed serious’--when she interrupted me. ‘Yes, it is always so!’ she said. ‘They surprised, inconsiderate young people, fairly full grown, see natural feeling little thing like me! They make plaything me, use amusement, throw away tired, wonder I feel toy horse wooden soldier! Yes, yes, that is way. The old way!’ ‘It may be, others,’ I returned, ‘but I assure me. Perhaps I ought surprised see now: I know little you. I said, without consideration, I thought.’ ‘What I do?’ returned little woman, standing up, holding her arms show herself. ‘See! What I am, father was; sister is; brother is. I worked sister brother many years--hard, Mr. Copperfield--all day. I must live. I harm. If people unreflecting cruel, make jest me, left make jest myself, them, everything? If I so, time, whose fault that? Mine?’ No. Not Miss Mowcher’s, I perceived. ‘If I shown sensitive dwarf false friend,’ pursued little woman, shaking her head me, reproachful earnestness, ‘how much his help good think I ever had? If little Mowcher (who hand, young gentleman, making herself) addressed herself him, like him, her misfortunes, suppose her small voice would heard? Little Mowcher would much need live, she bitterest dullest pigmies; she could not it. No. She might whistle her bread butter till she died Air.’ Miss Mowcher sat fender again, took her handkerchief, wiped her eyes. ‘Be thankful me, kind heart, I think have,’ she said, ‘that I know well I am, I cheerful endure all. I thankful myself, rate, I find tiny way world, without beholden anyone; return thrown me, folly vanity, I go along, I throw bubbles back. If I do not brood I want, better me, worse anyone. If I plaything giants, gentle me.’ Miss Mowcher replaced her handkerchief her pocket, looking intent expression while, pursued: ‘I saw street now. You may suppose I able walk fast you, short legs short breath, I could not overtake you; I guessed came, came you. I before, today, good woman was not home.’ ‘Do know her?’ I demanded. ‘I know her, her,’ she replied, ‘from Omer Joram. I seven of the clock morning. Do remember Steerforth said unfortunate girl, time I saw inn?’ The great bonnet Miss Mowcher’s head, greater bonnet wall, began go backwards forwards she asked question. I remembered well she referred to, thoughts many times day. I told her so. ‘May Father Evil confound him,’ said little woman, holding her forefinger her sparkling eyes, ‘and ten times confound wicked servant; I believed YOU boyish passion her!’ ‘I?’ I repeated. ‘Child, child! In name blind ill-fortune,’ cried Miss Mowcher, wringing her hands impatiently, she went fro upon fender, ‘why praise her so, blush, look disturbed?’ I could conceal I done this, though reason different her supposition. ‘What I know?’ said Miss Mowcher, taking her handkerchief again, giving one little stamp ground whenever, short intervals, she applied her eyes hands once. ‘He crossing wheedling you, I saw; soft wax his hands, I saw. Had I left room minute, his man told “Young Innocence” (so he called you, may call “Old Guilt” days life) set his heart upon her, she giddy liked him, his master resolved harm come it--more sake hers--and business here? How could I BUT believe him? I saw Steerforth soothe please his praise her! You first mention her name. You owned old admiration her. You hot cold, red white, I spoke her. What could I think--what DID I think--but young libertine everything experience, fallen hands experience enough, could manage (having fancy) good? Oh! oh! oh! They afraid finding truth,’ exclaimed Miss Mowcher, getting fender, trotting kitchen her two short arms distressfully lifted up, ‘because I sharp little thing--I need be, get world all!--and deceived altogether, I gave poor unfortunate girl letter, I fully believe beginning her ever speaking Littimer, left behind purpose!’ I stood amazed revelation perfidy, looking Miss Mowcher she walked kitchen she breath: she sat upon fender again, and, drying her face her handkerchief, shook her head long time, without otherwise moving, without breaking silence. ‘My country rounds,’ she added length, ‘brought Norwich, Mr. Copperfield, night last. What I happened find there, secret way coming going, without you--which strange--led suspecting something wrong. I got coach London last night, came Norwich, morning. Oh, oh, oh! late!’ Poor little Mowcher turned chilly her crying fretting, she turned round fender, putting her poor little wet feet among ashes warm them, sat looking fire, like large doll. I sat chair side hearth, lost unhappy reflections, looking fire too, sometimes her. ‘I must go,’ she said last, rising she spoke. ‘It is late. You do not mistrust me?’ Meeting her sharp glance, sharp ever she asked me, I could short challenge answer no, quite frankly. ‘Come!’ said she, accepting offer hand help her fender, looking wistfully face, ‘you know would not mistrust me, I full-sized woman!’ I felt much truth this; I felt rather ashamed myself. ‘You young man,’ she said, nodding. ‘Take word advice, even three foot nothing. Try associate bodily defects mental, good friend, except solid reason.’ She got fender now, I got suspicion. I told her I believed she given faithful account herself, hapless instruments designing hands. She thanked me, said I good fellow. ‘Now, mind!’ she exclaimed, turning back her way door, looking shrewdly me, her forefinger again.--‘I reason suspect, I heard--my ears always open; I cannot afford spare powers I have--that gone abroad. But ever return, ever one returns, I alive, I likely another, going I do, find soon. Whatever I know, shall know. If ever I anything serve poor betrayed girl, I faithfully, please Heaven! And Littimer better bloodhound his back, little Mowcher!’ I placed implicit faith last statement, I marked look accompanied. ‘Trust more, trust less, would trust full-sized woman,’ said little creature, touching appealingly wrist. ‘If ever see again, unlike I now, like I first saw me, observe company I in. Call mind I helpless defenceless little thing. Think home brother like sister like myself, day’s work done. Perhaps will not, then, hard upon me, surprised I distressed serious. Good night!’ I gave Miss Mowcher hand, different opinion her I hitherto entertained, opened door let her out. It trifling business get great umbrella up, properly balanced her grasp; last I successfully accomplished this, saw go bobbing street rain, without least appearance anybody underneath it, except heavier fall usual over-charged water-spout sent toppling over, one side, discovered Miss Mowcher struggling violently get right. After making one two sallies her relief, rendered futile umbrella’s hopping again, like immense bird, I could reach it, I came in, went bed, slept till morning. In morning I joined Mr. Peggotty old nurse, went early hour coach office, Mrs. Gummidge Ham waiting take leave us. ‘Mas’r Davy,’ Ham whispered, drawing aside, Mr. Peggotty stowing his bag among luggage, ‘his life quite broke up. He doen’t know wheer he is going; he doen’t know--what is afore him; he is bound upon voyage that will last, off, rest his days, take wured ‘t, unless he finds he is seeking of. I sure you will friend him, Mas’r Davy?’ ‘Trust me, I indeed,’ said I, shaking hands Ham earnestly. ‘Thankee. Thankee, kind, sir. One thing furder. I am good employ, know, Mas’r Davy, I han’t way spending I gets. Money’s use more, except live. If lay him, I shall work better art. Though that, sir,’ he spoke steadily mildly, ‘you are think I shall work times, like man, act best lays power!’ I told I well convinced it; I hinted I hoped time might even come, he would cease lead lonely life he naturally contemplated now. ‘No, sir,’ he said, shaking his head, ‘all that is past me, sir. No one never fill place that is empty. But you will bear mind money, theer’s times laying him?’ Reminding fact, Mr. Peggotty derived steady, though certainly moderate income bequest his late brother-in-law, I promised so. We took leave other. I cannot leave even now, without remembering pang, his modest fortitude his great sorrow. As Mrs. Gummidge, I endeavour describe she ran street side coach, seeing nothing Mr. Peggotty roof, tears she tried repress, dashing herself people coming opposite direction, I enter task difficulty. Therefore I better leave her sitting baker’s door-step, breath, shape remaining her bonnet, one her shoes off, lying pavement considerable distance. When got journey’s end, first pursuit look little lodging Peggotty, her brother could bed. We fortunate find one, clean cheap description, chandler’s shop, two streets removed me. When engaged domicile, I bought cold meat eating-house, took fellow-travellers home tea; proceeding, I regret state, meet Mrs. Crupp’s approval, quite contrary. I ought observe, however, explanation lady’s state mind, she much offended Peggotty’s tucking her widow’s gown she ten minutes place, setting work dust bedroom. This Mrs. Crupp regarded light liberty, liberty, she said, thing she never allowed. Mr. Peggotty made communication way London I unprepared. It was, he purposed first seeing Mrs. Steerforth. As I felt bound assist this, also mediate them; view sparing mother’s feelings much possible, I wrote her night. I told her mildly I could his wrong was, share his injury. I said he man common life, gentle upright character; I ventured express hope she would refuse see his heavy trouble. I mentioned two of the clock afternoon hour coming, I sent letter first coach morning. At appointed time, stood door--the door house I been, days since, happy: youthful confidence warmth heart yielded freely: closed henceforth: waste, ruin. No Littimer appeared. The pleasanter face replaced his, occasion last visit, answered summons, went us drawing-room. Mrs. Steerforth sitting there. Rosa Dartle glided, went in, another part room stood behind her chair. I saw, directly, his mother’s face, she knew he done. It pale; bore traces deeper emotion letter alone, weakened doubts her fondness would raised upon it, would likely create. I thought her like ever I thought her; I felt, rather saw, resemblance lost companion. She sat upright her arm-chair, stately, immovable, passionless air, seemed nothing could disturb. She looked steadfastly Mr. Peggotty he stood her; he looked quite steadfastly her. Rosa Dartle’s keen glance comprehended us. For moments word spoken. She motioned Mr. Peggotty seated. He said, low voice, ‘I should not feel nat’ral, madam, sit house. I would sooner stand.’ And succeeded another silence, she broke thus: ‘I know, deep regret, brought here. What want me? What ask do?’ He put his hat his arm, feeling his breast Emily’s letter, took out, unfolded it, gave her. ‘Please read that, madam. That is niece’s hand!’ She read it, stately impassive way,--untouched contents, far I could see,--and returned him. ‘“Unless he brings back lady,”’ said Mr. Peggotty, tracing part his finger. ‘I come know, madam, whether he keep his wured?’ ‘No,’ she returned. ‘Why not?’ said Mr. Peggotty. ‘It impossible. He would disgrace himself. You cannot fail know she far him.’ ‘Raise her up!’ said Mr. Peggotty. ‘She uneducated ignorant.’ ‘Maybe she is not; maybe she is,’ said Mr. Peggotty. ‘I think not, madam; I am judge things. Teach her better!’ ‘Since oblige speak plainly, I unwilling do, her humble connexions would render thing impossible, nothing else did.’ ‘Hark this, madam,’ he returned, slowly quietly. ‘You know love child. So I. If she hundred times child, I could not love her more. You doen’t know lose child. I do. All heaps riches wureld would nowt (if mine) buy her back! But, save her disgrace, she shall never disgraced us. Not one us she is growed among, one us that is lived along her her all, many year, ever look upon her pritty face again. We will content let her be; we will content think her, far off, she underneath another sun sky; we will content trust her her husband,--to her little children, p’raps,--and bide time us shall alike quality afore God!’ The rugged eloquence he spoke, devoid effect. She still preserved her proud manner, touch softness her voice, she answered: ‘I justify nothing. I make counter-accusations. But I sorry repeat, impossible. Such marriage would irretrievably blight son’s career, ruin his prospects. Nothing certain never take place, never will. If compensation--’ ‘I looking likeness face,’ interrupted Mr. Peggotty, steady kindling eye, ‘that looked me, home, fireside, boat--wheer not?---smiling friendly, treacherous, I go half wild I think it. If likeness face do not turn burning fire, thought offering money child’s blight ruin, it is bad. I doen’t know, lady’s, it is worse.’ She changed now, moment. An angry flush overspread her features; she said, intolerant manner, grasping arm-chair tightly her hands: ‘What compensation make ME opening pit son? What love mine? What separation ours?’ Miss Dartle softly touched her, bent her head whisper, she would hear word. ‘No, Rosa, word! Let man listen I say! My son, object life, every thought devoted, I gratified child every wish, I separate existence since his birth,--to take moment miserable girl, avoid me! To repay confidence systematic deception, her sake, quit her! To set wretched fancy, his mother’s claims upon his duty, love, respect, gratitude--claims every day hour his life strengthened ties nothing could proof against! Is injury?’ Again Rosa Dartle tried soothe her; ineffectually. ‘I say, Rosa, word! If he stake his upon lightest object, I stake upon greater purpose. Let go he will, means love secured him! Does he think reduce long absence? He knows his mother little he does. Let put away his whim now, he welcome back. Let put her away now, he never shall come near me, living dying, I raise hand make sign it, unless, rid her ever, he comes humbly begs forgiveness. This right. This acknowledgement I WILL HAVE. This separation us! And this,’ she added, looking her visitor proud intolerant air she begun, ‘no injury?’ While I heard saw mother she said words, I seemed hear see son, defying them. All I ever seen unyielding, wilful spirit, I saw her. All understanding I his misdirected energy, became understanding her character too, perception was, strongest springs, same. She observed me, aloud, resuming her former restraint, useless hear more, say more, she begged put end interview. She rose air dignity leave room, Mr. Peggotty signified needless. ‘Doen’t fear hindrance you, I say, madam,’ he remarked, he moved towards door. ‘I come heer hope, I take away hope. I done I thowt done, I never looked fur good come stan’ning I do. This evil house fur mine, fur right senses expect it.’ With this, departed; leaving her standing her elbow-chair, picture noble presence handsome face. We had, way out, cross paved hall, glass sides roof, vine trained. Its leaves shoots green then, day sunny, pair glass doors leading garden thrown open. Rosa Dartle, entering way noiseless step, close them, addressed herself me: ‘You well,’ she said, ‘indeed, bring fellow here!’ Such concentration rage scorn darkened her face, flashed her jet-black eyes, I could thought compressible even face. The scar made hammer was, usual excited state her features, strongly marked. When throbbing I seen before, came I looked her, she absolutely lifted her hand, struck it. ‘This fellow,’ she said, ‘to champion bring here, he not? You true man!’ ‘Miss Dartle,’ I returned, ‘you surely unjust condemn ME!’ ‘Why bring division two mad creatures?’ she returned. ‘Do not know mad self-will pride?’ ‘Is doing?’ I returned. ‘Is doing!’ she retorted. ‘Why bring man here?’ ‘He deeply-injured man, Miss Dartle,’ I replied. ‘You may know it.’ ‘I know James Steerforth,’ she said, her hand her bosom, prevent storm raging there, loud, ‘has false, corrupt heart, traitor. But need I know care fellow, his common niece?’ ‘Miss Dartle,’ I returned, ‘you deepen injury. It sufficient already. I say, parting, great wrong.’ ‘I wrong,’ she returned. ‘They depraved, worthless set. I would her whipped!’ Mr. Peggotty passed on, without word, went door. ‘Oh, shame, Miss Dartle! shame!’ I said indignantly. ‘How bear trample his undeserved affliction!’ ‘I would trample all,’ she answered. ‘I would his house pulled down. I would her branded face, dressed rags, cast streets starve. If I power sit judgement her, I would see done. See done? I would it! I detest her. If I ever could reproach her her infamous condition, I would go anywhere so. If I could hunt her her grave, I would. If word comfort would solace her her dying hour, I possessed it, I would not part Life itself.’ The mere vehemence her words convey, I sensible, weak impression passion she possessed, made articulate her whole figure, though her voice, instead raised, lower usual. No description I could give her would justice recollection her, her entire deliverance herself her anger. I seen passion many forms, I never seen form that. When I joined Mr. Peggotty, he walking slowly thoughtfully hill. He told me, soon I came him, discharged his mind he purposed London, he meant ‘to set his travels’, night. I asked he meant go? He answered, ‘I am going, sir, seek niece.’ We went back little lodging chandler’s shop, I found opportunity repeating Peggotty he said me. She informed me, return, he said her morning. She knew I did, he going, she thought he project shaped his mind. I like leave him, circumstances, three dined together beefsteak pie--which one many good things Peggotty famous--and curiously flavoured occasion, I recollect well, miscellaneous taste tea, coffee, butter, bacon, cheese, new loaves, firewood, candles, walnut ketchup, continually ascending shop. After dinner sat hour near window, without talking much; Mr. Peggotty got up, brought his oilskin bag his stout stick, laid table. He accepted, his sister’s stock ready money, small sum account his legacy; barely enough, I thought, keep month. He promised communicate me, anything befell him; he slung his bag him, took his hat stick, bade us ‘Good-bye!’ ‘All good attend you, dear old woman,’ he said, embracing Peggotty, ‘and too, Mas’r Davy!’ shaking hands me. ‘I am a-going seek her, fur wide. If she come home I am away--but ah, are not like be!--or I bring her back, meaning is, she shall live die one cannot reproach her. If hurt come me, remember last words I left her was, “My unchanged love darling child, I forgive her!”’ He said solemnly, bare-headed; then, putting his hat, he went stairs, away. We followed door. It warm, dusty evening, time when, great main thoroughfare by-way turned, temporary lull eternal tread feet upon pavement, strong red sunshine. He turned, alone, corner shady street, glow light, lost him. Rarely hour evening come, rarely I wake night, rarely I look moon, stars, watch falling rain, hear wind, I thought his solitary figure toiling on, poor pilgrim, recalled words: ‘I am going seek her, fur wide. If hurt come me, remember last words I left her was, “My unchanged love darling child, I forgive her!”’ CHAPTER 33. BLISSFUL All time, I gone loving Dora, harder ever. Her idea refuge disappointment distress, made amends me, even loss friend. The I pitied myself, pitied others, I sought consolation image Dora. The greater accumulation deceit trouble world, brighter purer shone star Dora high world. I do not think I definite idea Dora came from, degree she related higher order beings; I quite sure I scouted notion her simply human, like young lady, indignation contempt. If I may express it, I steeped Dora. I merely head ears love her, I saturated through. Enough love might wrung me, metaphorically speaking, drown anybody in; yet would remained enough within me, me, pervade entire existence. The first thing I did, account, I came back, take night-walk Norwood, and, like subject venerable riddle childhood, go ‘round round house, without ever touching house’, thinking Dora. I believe theme incomprehensible conundrum moon. No matter was, I, moon-struck slave Dora, perambulated round round house garden two hours, looking crevices palings, getting chin dint violent exertion rusty nails top, blowing kisses lights windows, romantically calling night, intervals, shield Dora--I do not exactly know from, I suppose fire. Perhaps mice, she great objection. My love much mind natural confide Peggotty, I found her side evening old set industrial implements, busily making tour wardrobe, I imparted her, sufficiently roundabout way, great secret. Peggotty strongly interested, I could get her view case all. She audaciously prejudiced favour, quite unable understand I misgivings, low-spirited it. ‘The young lady might think herself well off,’ she observed, ‘to beau. And her Pa,’ she said, ‘what gentleman expect, gracious sake!’ I observed, however, Mr. Spenlow’s proctorial gown stiff cravat took Peggotty little, inspired her greater reverence man gradually becoming etherealized eyes every day, reflected radiance seemed beam he sat erect Court among his papers, like little lighthouse sea stationery. And by, used uncommonly strange consider, I remember, I sat Court too, dim old judges doctors would not cared Dora, known her; would not gone senses rapture, marriage Dora proposed them; Dora might sung, played upon glorified guitar, she led verge madness, yet tempted one slow-goers inch his road! I despised them, man. Frozen-out old gardeners flower-beds heart, I took personal offence all. The Bench nothing insensible blunderer. The Bar tenderness poetry it, bar public-house. Taking management Peggotty’s affairs hands, little pride, I proved will, came settlement Legacy Duty-office, took her Bank, soon got everything orderly train. We varied legal character proceedings going see perspiring Wax-work, Fleet Street (melted, I hope, twenty years); visiting Miss Linwood’s Exhibition, I remember Mausoleum needlework, favourable self-examination repentance; inspecting Tower London; going top St. Paul’s. All wonders afforded Peggotty much pleasure she able enjoy, existing circumstances: except, I think, St. Paul’s, which, her long attachment her work-box, became rival picture lid, was, particulars, vanquished, she considered, work art. Peggotty’s business, used call ‘common-form business’ Commons (and light lucrative common-form business was), settled, I took her office one morning pay her bill. Mr. Spenlow stepped out, old Tiffey said, get gentleman sworn marriage licence; I knew he would back directly, place lying close Surrogate’s, Vicar-General’s office too, I told Peggotty wait. We little like undertakers, Commons, regarded Probate transactions; generally making rule look less cut up, deal clients mourning. In similar feeling delicacy, always blithe light-hearted licence clients. Therefore I hinted Peggotty she would find Mr. Spenlow much recovered shock Mr. Barkis’s decease; indeed he came like bridegroom. But neither Peggotty I eyes him, saw, company him, Mr. Murdstone. He little changed. His hair looked thick, certainly black, ever; his glance little trusted old. ‘Ah, Copperfield?’ said Mr. Spenlow. ‘You know gentleman, I believe?’ I made gentleman distant bow, Peggotty barely recognized him. He was, first, somewhat disconcerted meet us two together; quickly decided do, came me. ‘I hope,’ he said, ‘that well?’ ‘It hardly interesting you,’ said I. ‘Yes, wish know.’ We looked other, he addressed Peggotty. ‘And you,’ said he. ‘I sorry observe lost husband.’ ‘It is first loss I life, Mr. Murdstone,’ replied Peggotty, trembling head foot. ‘I glad hope nobody blame one,--nobody answer it.’ ‘Ha!’ said he; ‘that is comfortable reflection. You done duty?’ ‘I worn anybody’s life away,’ said Peggotty, ‘I thankful think! No, Mr. Murdstone, I worrited frightened sweet creetur early grave!’ He eyed her gloomily--remorsefully I thought--for instant; said, turning his head towards me, looking feet instead face: ‘We likely encounter soon again;--a source satisfaction us both, doubt, meetings never agreeable. I expect you, always rebelled authority, exerted benefit reformation, owe good-will now. There antipathy us--’ ‘An old one, I believe?’ said I, interrupting him. He smiled, shot evil glance could come his dark eyes. ‘It rankled baby breast,’ he said. ‘It embittered life poor mother. You right. I hope may better, yet; I hope may correct yourself.’ Here he ended dialogue, carried low voice, corner outer office, passing Mr. Spenlow’s room, saying aloud, his smoothest manner: ‘Gentlemen Mr. Spenlow’s profession accustomed family differences, know complicated difficult always are!’ With that, he paid money his licence; and, receiving neatly folded Mr. Spenlow, together shake hand, polite wish his happiness lady’s, went office. I might difficulty constraining silent his words, I less difficulty impressing upon Peggotty (who angry account, good creature!) place recrimination, I besought her hold her peace. She unusually roused, I glad compound affectionate hug, elicited revival her mind old injuries, make best I could it, Mr. Spenlow clerks. Mr. Spenlow appear know connexion Mr. Murdstone was; I glad of, I could bear acknowledge him, even breast, remembering I history poor mother. Mr. Spenlow seemed think, he thought anything matter, aunt leader state party family, rebel party commanded somebody else--so I gathered least he said, waiting Mr. Tiffey make Peggotty’s bill costs. ‘Miss Trotwood,’ he remarked, ‘is firm, doubt, likely give way opposition. I admiration her character, I may congratulate you, Copperfield, right side. Differences relations much deplored--but extremely general--and great thing is, right side’: meaning, I take it, side moneyed interest. ‘Rather good marriage this, I believe?’ said Mr. Spenlow. I explained I knew nothing it. ‘Indeed!’ he said. ‘Speaking words Mr. Murdstone dropped--as man frequently occasions--and Miss Murdstone let fall, I say rather good marriage.’ ‘Do mean money, sir?’ I asked. ‘Yes,’ said Mr. Spenlow, ‘I understand there is money. Beauty too, I told.’ ‘Indeed! Is his new wife young?’ ‘Just age,’ said Mr. Spenlow. ‘So lately, I think waiting that.’ ‘Lord deliver her!’ said Peggotty. So emphatically unexpectedly, three discomposed; Tiffey came bill. Old Tiffey soon appeared, however, handed Mr. Spenlow, look over. Mr. Spenlow, settling his chin his cravat rubbing softly, went items deprecatory air--as Jorkins’s doing--and handed back Tiffey bland sigh. ‘Yes,’ he said. ‘That is right. Quite right. I extremely happy, Copperfield, limited charges actual expenditure pocket, irksome incident professional life, I liberty consult wishes. I partner--Mr. Jorkins.’ As he said gentle melancholy, next thing making charge all, I expressed acknowledgements Peggotty’s behalf, paid Tiffey banknotes. Peggotty retired her lodging, Mr. Spenlow I went Court, divorce-suit coming on, ingenious little statute (repealed now, I believe, virtue I seen several marriages annulled), merits these. The husband, whose name Thomas Benjamin, taken his marriage licence Thomas only; suppressing Benjamin, case he find comfortable he expected. NOT finding comfortable he expected, little fatigued his wife, poor fellow, he came forward, friend, married year two, declared his name Thomas Benjamin, therefore he married all. Which Court confirmed, his great satisfaction. I must say I doubts strict justice this, even frightened bushel wheat reconciles anomalies. But Mr. Spenlow argued matter me. He said, Look world, good evil that; look ecclesiastical law, good evil THAT. It part system. Very good. There were! I hardihood suggest Dora’s father possibly might even improve world little, got early morning, took coats work; I confessed I thought might improve Commons. Mr. Spenlow replied he would particularly advise dismiss idea mind, worthy gentlemanly character; he would glad hear improvement I thought Commons susceptible? Taking part Commons happened nearest us--for man unmarried time, Court, strolling past Prerogative Office--I submitted I thought Prerogative Office rather queerly managed institution. Mr. Spenlow inquired respect? I replied, due deference his experience (but deference, I afraid, his Dora’s father), perhaps little nonsensical Registry Court, containing original wills persons leaving effects within immense province Canterbury, three whole centuries, accidental building, never designed purpose, leased registrars Own private emolument, unsafe, even ascertained fire-proof, choked important documents held, positively, roof basement, mercenary speculation registrars, took great fees public, crammed public’s wills away anyhow anywhere, object get rid cheaply. That, perhaps, little unreasonable registrars receipt profits amounting eight nine thousand pounds year (to say nothing profits deputy registrars, clerks seats), obliged spend little money, finding reasonably safe place important documents classes people compelled hand them, whether would no. That, perhaps, little unjust, great offices great office magnificent sinecures, unfortunate working-clerks cold dark room upstairs worst rewarded, least considered men, important services, London. That perhaps little indecent principal registrar all, whose duty find public, constantly resorting place, needful accommodation, enormous sinecurist virtue post (and might be, besides, clergyman, pluralist, holder staff cathedral, not),--while public put inconvenience specimen every afternoon office busy, knew quite monstrous. That, perhaps, short, Prerogative Office diocese Canterbury altogether pestilent job, pernicious absurdity, squeezed away corner St. Paul’s Churchyard, people knew, must turned completely inside out, upside down, long ago. Mr. Spenlow smiled I became modestly warm subject, argued question he argued other. He said, all? It question feeling. If public felt wills safe keeping, took granted office made better, worse it? Nobody. Who better it? All Sinecurists. Very well. Then good predominated. It might perfect system; nothing perfect; he objected to, was, insertion wedge. Under Prerogative Office, country glorious. Insert wedge Prerogative Office, country would cease glorious. He considered principle gentleman take things he found them; he doubt Prerogative Office would last time. I deferred his opinion, though I great doubts myself. I find he right, however; lasted present moment, done teeth great parliamentary report made (not willingly) eighteen years ago, objections mine set forth detail, existing stowage wills described equal accumulation two years half more. What done since; whether lost many, whether sell any, then, butter shops; I do not know. I glad mine there, I hope may go there, yet awhile. I set down, present blissful chapter, comes natural place. Mr. Spenlow I falling conversation, prolonged saunter fro, diverged general topics. And came about, end, Mr. Spenlow told day week Dora’s birthday, he would glad I would come join little picnic occasion. I went senses immediately; became mere driveller next day, receipt little lace-edged sheet note-paper, ‘Favoured papa. To remind’; passed intervening period state dotage. I think I committed every possible absurdity way preparation blessed event. I turn hot I remember cravat I bought. My boots might placed collection instruments torture. I provided, sent Norwood coach night before, delicate little hamper, amounting itself, I thought, almost declaration. There crackers tenderest mottoes could got money. At six morning, I Covent Garden Market, buying bouquet Dora. At ten I horseback (I hired gallant grey, occasion), bouquet hat, keep fresh, trotting Norwood. I suppose I saw Dora garden pretended see her, rode past house pretending anxiously looking it, I committed two small fooleries young gentlemen circumstances might committed--because came natural me. But oh! I DID find house, DID dismount garden-gate, drag stony-hearted boots across lawn Dora sitting garden-seat lilac tree, spectacle she was, upon beautiful morning, among butterflies, white chip bonnet dress celestial blue! There young lady her--comparatively stricken years--almost twenty, I say. Her name Miss Mills. And Dora called her Julia. She bosom friend Dora. Happy Miss Mills! Jip there, Jip WOULD bark again. When I presented bouquet, he gnashed his teeth jealousy. Well he might. If he least idea I adored his mistress, well he might! ‘Oh, thank you, Mr. Copperfield! What dear flowers!’ said Dora. I intention saying (and studying best form words three miles) I thought beautiful I saw near HER. But I could not manage it. She bewildering. To see her lay flowers her little dimpled chin, lose presence mind power language feeble ecstasy. I wonder I did not say, ‘Kill me, heart, Miss Mills. Let die here!’ Then Dora held flowers Jip smell. Then Jip growled, would not smell them. Then Dora laughed, held little closer Jip, make him. Then Jip laid hold bit geranium his teeth, worried imaginary cats it. Then Dora beat him, pouted, said, ‘My poor beautiful flowers!’ compassionately, I thought, Jip laid hold me. I wished he had! ‘You will glad hear, Mr. Copperfield,’ said Dora, ‘that cross Miss Murdstone here. She gone her brother’s marriage, away least three weeks. Is not delightful?’ I said I sure must delightful her, delightful her delightful me. Miss Mills, air superior wisdom benevolence, smiled upon us. ‘She disagreeable thing I ever saw,’ said Dora. ‘You cannot believe ill-tempered shocking she is, Julia.’ ‘Yes, I can, dear!’ said Julia. ‘YOU can, perhaps, love,’ returned Dora, her hand Julia’s. ‘Forgive excepting you, dear, first.’ I learnt, this, Miss Mills her trials course chequered existence; these, perhaps, I might refer wise benignity manner I already noticed. I found, course day, case: Miss Mills unhappy misplaced affection, understood retired world her awful stock experience, still take calm interest unblighted hopes loves youth. But Mr. Spenlow came house, Dora went him, saying, ‘Look, papa, beautiful flowers!’ And Miss Mills smiled thoughtfully, say, ‘Ye Mayflies, enjoy brief existence bright morning life!’ And walked lawn towards carriage, getting ready. I shall never ride again. I never another. There three, hamper, hamper, guitar-case, phaeton; and, course, phaeton open; I rode behind it, Dora sat her back horses, looking towards me. She kept bouquet close her cushion, would not allow Jip sit side her all, fear he crush it. She often carried her hand, often refreshed herself fragrance. Our eyes times often met; great astonishment I did not go head gallant grey carriage. There dust, I believe. There good deal dust, I believe. I faint impression Mr. Spenlow remonstrated riding it; I knew none. I sensible mist love beauty Dora, nothing else. He stood sometimes, asked I thought prospect. I said delightful, I dare say was; Dora me. The sun shone Dora, birds sang Dora. The south wind blew Dora, wild flowers hedges Doras, bud. My comfort is, Miss Mills understood me. Miss Mills alone could enter feelings thoroughly. I do not know long going, hour I know little went. Perhaps near Guildford. Perhaps Arabian-night magician, opened place day, shut ever came away. It green spot, hill, carpeted soft turf. There shady trees, heather, and, far eye could see, rich landscape. It trying thing find people here, waiting us; jealousy, even ladies, knew bounds. But sex--especially one impostor, three four years elder, red whisker, he established amount presumption endured--were mortal foes. We unpacked baskets, employed getting dinner ready. Red Whisker pretended he could make salad (which I do not believe), obtruded public notice. Some young ladies washed lettuces him, sliced his directions. Dora among these. I felt fate pitted man, one us must fall. Red Whisker made his salad (I wondered could eat it. Nothing induced ME touch it!) voted charge wine-cellar, he constructed, ingenious beast, hollow trunk tree. By by, I saw him, majority lobster his plate, eating his dinner feet Dora! I indistinct idea happened time baleful object presented view. I merry, I know; hollow merriment. I attached young creature pink, little eyes, flirted her desperately. She received attentions favour; whether account solely, she designs Red Whisker, I cannot say. Dora’s health drunk. When I drank it, I affected interrupt conversation purpose, resume immediately afterwards. I caught Dora’s eye I bowed her, I thought looked appealing. But looked head Red Whisker, I adamant. The young creature pink mother green; I rather think latter separated us motives policy. Howbeit, general breaking party, remnants dinner put away; I strolled among trees, raging remorseful state. I debating whether I pretend I well, fly--I do not know where--upon gallant grey, Dora Miss Mills met me. ‘Mr. Copperfield,’ said Miss Mills, ‘you dull.’ I begged her pardon. Not all. ‘And Dora,’ said Miss Mills, ‘YOU dull.’ Oh dear no! Not least. ‘Mr. Copperfield Dora,’ said Miss Mills, almost venerable air. ‘Enough this. Do allow trivial misunderstanding wither blossoms spring, which, put forth blighted, cannot renewed. I speak,’ said Miss Mills, ‘from experience past--the remote, irrevocable past. The gushing fountains sparkle sun, must stopped mere caprice; oasis desert Sahara must plucked idly.’ I hardly knew I did, I burning extraordinary extent; I took Dora’s little hand kissed it--and she let me! I kissed Miss Mills’s hand; seemed, thinking, go straight seventh heaven. We come again. We stayed evening. At first strayed fro among trees: I Dora’s shy arm drawn mine: Heaven knows, folly was, would happy fate struck immortal foolish feelings, stayed among trees ever! But, much soon, heard others laughing talking, calling ‘where is Dora?’ So went back, wanted Dora sing. Red Whisker would got guitar-case carriage, Dora told nobody knew was, I. So Red Whisker done moment; I got it, I unlocked it, I took guitar out, I sat her, I held her handkerchief gloves, I drank every note her dear voice, she sang ME loved her, others might applaud much liked, nothing it! I intoxicated joy. I afraid happy real, I wake Buckingham Street presently, hear Mrs. Crupp clinking teacups getting breakfast ready. But Dora sang, others sang, Miss Mills sang--about slumbering echoes caverns Memory; she hundred years old--and evening came on; tea, kettle boiling gipsy-fashion; I still happy ever. I happier ever party broke up, people, defeated Red Whisker all, went several ways, went still evening dying light, sweet scents rising around us. Mr. Spenlow little drowsy champagne--honour soil grew grape, grape made wine, sun ripened it, merchant adulterated it!--and fast asleep corner carriage, I rode side talked Dora. She admired horse patted him--oh, dear little hand looked upon horse!--and her shawl would keep right, I drew round her arm; I even fancied Jip began see was, understand he must make his mind friends me. That sagacious Miss Mills, too; amiable, though quite used up, recluse; little patriarch something less twenty, done world, must not account slumbering echoes caverns Memory awakened; kind thing she did! ‘Mr. Copperfield,’ said Miss Mills, ‘come side carriage moment--if spare moment. I want speak you.’ Behold me, gallant grey, bending side Miss Mills, hand upon carriage door! ‘Dora coming stay me. She coming home day tomorrow. If would like call, I sure papa would happy see you.’ What could I invoke silent blessing Miss Mills’s head, store Miss Mills’s address securest corner memory! What could I tell Miss Mills, grateful looks fervent words, much I appreciated her good offices, inestimable value I set upon her friendship! Then Miss Mills benignantly dismissed me, saying, ‘Go back Dora!’ I went; Dora leaned carriage talk me, talked rest way; I rode gallant grey close wheel I grazed his near fore leg it, ‘took bark off’, his owner told me, ‘to tune three pun’ sivin’--which I paid, thought extremely cheap much joy. What time Miss Mills sat looking moon, murmuring verses--and recalling, I suppose, ancient days she earth anything common. Norwood many miles near, reached many hours soon; Mr. Spenlow came little short it, said, ‘You must come in, Copperfield, rest!’ I consenting, sandwiches wine-and-water. In light room, Dora blushing looked lovely, I could tear away, sat staring, dream, snoring Mr. Spenlow inspired sufficient consciousness take leave. So parted; I riding way London farewell touch Dora’s hand still light mine, recalling every incident word ten thousand times; lying bed last, enraptured young noodle ever carried his five wits love. When I awoke next morning, I resolute declare passion Dora, know fate. Happiness misery question. There question I knew world, Dora could give answer it. I passed three days luxury wretchedness, torturing putting every conceivable variety discouraging construction ever taken place Dora me. At last, arrayed purpose vast expense, I went Miss Mills’s, fraught declaration. How many times I went street, round square--painfully aware much better answer old riddle original one--before I could persuade go steps knock, matter now. Even when, last, I knocked, waiting door, I flurried thought asking Mr. Blackboy’s (in imitation poor Barkis), begging pardon, retreating. But I kept ground. Mr. Mills home. I expect he would be. Nobody wanted HIM. Miss Mills home. Miss Mills would do. I shown room upstairs, Miss Mills Dora were. Jip there. Miss Mills copying music (I recollect, new song, called ‘Affection’s Dirge’), Dora painting flowers. What feelings, I recognized flowers; identical Covent Garden Market purchase! I cannot say like, particularly resembled flowers ever come observation; I knew paper round accurately copied, composition was. Miss Mills glad see me, sorry her papa home: though I thought bore fortitude. Miss Mills conversational minutes, then, laying her pen upon ‘Affection’s Dirge’, got up, left room. I began think I would put till tomorrow. ‘I hope poor horse tired, he got home night,’ said Dora, lifting her beautiful eyes. ‘It long way him.’ I began think I would today. ‘It long way him,’ said I, ‘for he nothing uphold journey.’ ‘Was not he fed, poor thing?’ asked Dora. I began think I would put till tomorrow. ‘Ye-yes,’ I said, ‘he well taken care of. I mean he unutterable happiness I near you.’ Dora bent her head her drawing said, little while--I sat, interval, burning fever, legs rigid state-- ‘You did not seem sensible happiness yourself, one time day.’ I saw I it, must done spot. ‘You did not care happiness least,’ said Dora, slightly raising her eyebrows, shaking her head, ‘when sitting Miss Kitt.’ Kitt, I observe, name creature pink, little eyes. ‘Though certainly I do not know should,’ said Dora, ‘or call happiness all. But course do not mean say. And I sure one doubts liberty whatever like. Jip, naughty boy, come here!’ I do not know I it. I moment. I intercepted Jip. I Dora arms. I full eloquence. I never stopped word. I told her I loved her. I told her I die without her. I told her I idolized worshipped her. Jip barked madly time. When Dora hung her head cried, trembled, eloquence increased much more. If she would like die her, she say word, I ready. Life without Dora’s love thing terms. I could not bear it, I would not. I loved her every minute, day night, since I first saw her. I loved her minute distraction. I always love her, every minute, distraction. Lovers loved before, lovers would love again; lover loved, might, could, would, ever love, I loved Dora. The I raved, Jip barked. Each us, his way, got mad every moment. Well, well! Dora I sitting sofa by, quiet enough, Jip lying her lap, winking peacefully me. It mind. I state perfect rapture. Dora I engaged. I suppose notion end marriage. We must some, Dora stipulated never married without her papa’s consent. But, youthful ecstasy, I do not think really looked us behind us; aspiration beyond ignorant present. We keep secret Mr. Spenlow; I sure idea never entered head, then, anything dishonourable that. Miss Mills usually pensive Dora, going find her, brought her back;--I apprehend, tendency passed awaken slumbering echoes caverns Memory. But she gave us her blessing, assurance her lasting friendship, spoke us, generally, became Voice Cloister. What idle time was! What insubstantial, happy, foolish time was! When I measured Dora’s finger ring made Forget-me-nots, jeweller, I took measure, found out, laughed his order-book, charged anything he liked pretty little toy, blue stones--so associated remembrance Dora’s hand, yesterday, I saw another, chance, finger daughter, momentary stirring heart, like pain! When I walked about, exalted secret, full interest, felt dignity loving Dora, beloved, much, I walked air, I could people situated, creeping earth! When meetings garden square, sat within dingy summer-house, happy, I love London sparrows hour, nothing else, see plumage tropics smoky feathers! When first great quarrel (within week betrothal), Dora sent back ring, enclosed despairing cocked-hat note, wherein she used terrible expression ‘our love begun folly, ended madness!’ dreadful words occasioned tear hair, cry over! When, cover night, I flew Miss Mills, I saw stealth back kitchen mangle, implored Miss Mills interpose us avert insanity. When Miss Mills undertook office returned Dora, exhorting us, pulpit her bitter youth, mutual concession, avoidance Desert Sahara! When cried, made up, blest again, back kitchen, mangle all, changed Love’s temple, arranged plan correspondence Miss Mills, always comprehend least one letter side every day! What idle time! What insubstantial, happy, foolish time! Of times mine Time his grip, none one retrospect I smile half much, think half tenderly. CHAPTER 34. MY AUNT ASTONISHES ME I wrote Agnes soon Dora I engaged. I wrote her long letter, I tried make her comprehend blest I was, darling Dora was. I entreated Agnes regard thoughtless passion could ever yield other, least resemblance boyish fancies used joke about. I assured her profundity quite unfathomable, expressed belief nothing like ever known. Somehow, I wrote Agnes fine evening open window, remembrance her clear calm eyes gentle face came stealing me, she would peaceful influence upon hurry agitation I living lately, happiness partook degree, soothed tears. I remember I sat resting head upon hand, letter half done, cherishing general fancy Agnes one elements natural home. As if, retirement house made almost sacred her presence, Dora I must happier anywhere. As if, love, joy, sorrow, hope, disappointment; emotions; heart turned naturally there, found refuge best friend. Of Steerforth I said nothing. I told her sad grief Yarmouth, account Emily’s flight; made double wound, reason circumstances attending it. I knew quick she always divine truth, she would never first breathe his name. To letter, I received answer return post. As I read it, I seemed hear Agnes speaking me. It like her cordial voice ears. What I say more! While I away home lately, Traddles called twice thrice. Finding Peggotty within, informed Peggotty (who always volunteered information whomsoever would receive it), she old nurse, he established good-humoured acquaintance her, stayed little chat her me. So Peggotty said; I afraid chat her side, immoderate length, she difficult indeed stop, God bless her! she her theme. This reminds me, I expected Traddles certain afternoon his appointing, come, Mrs. Crupp resigned everything appertaining her office (the salary excepted) Peggotty cease present herself. Mrs. Crupp, holding divers conversations respecting Peggotty, high-pitched voice, staircase--with invisible Familiar would appear, corporeally speaking she quite alone times--addressed letter me, developing her views. Beginning statement universal application, fitted every occurrence her life, namely, she mother herself, she went inform she seen different days, periods her existence she constitutional objection spies, intruders, informers. She named names, she said; let cap fitted, wear it; spies, intruders, informers, especially widders’ weeds (this clause underlined), she ever accustomed herself look upon. If gentleman victim spies, intruders, informers (but still naming names), his pleasure. He right please himself; let do. All she, Mrs. Crupp, stipulated for, was, she ‘brought contract’ persons. Therefore she begged excused attendance top set, things formerly was, could wished be; mentioned her little book would found upon breakfast-table every Saturday morning, she requested immediate settlement same, benevolent view saving trouble ‘and ill-conwenience’ parties. After this, Mrs. Crupp confined herself making pitfalls stairs, principally pitchers, endeavouring delude Peggotty breaking her legs. I found rather harassing live state siege, much afraid Mrs. Crupp see way it. ‘My dear Copperfield,’ cried Traddles, punctually appearing door, spite obstacles, ‘how do?’ ‘My dear Traddles,’ said I, ‘I delighted see last, sorry I home before. But I much engaged--’ ‘Yes, yes, I know,’ said Traddles, ‘of course. Yours lives London, I think.’ ‘What say?’ ‘She--excuse me--Miss D., know,’ said Traddles, colouring his great delicacy, ‘lives London, I believe?’ ‘Oh yes. Near London.’ ‘Mine, perhaps recollect,’ said Traddles, serious look, ‘lives Devonshire--one ten. Consequently, I much engaged you--in sense.’ ‘I wonder bear,’ I returned, ‘to see her seldom.’ ‘Hah!’ said Traddles, thoughtfully. ‘It seem wonder. I suppose is, Copperfield, help it?’ ‘I suppose so,’ I replied smile, without blush. ‘And much constancy patience, Traddles.’ ‘Dear me!’ said Traddles, considering it, ‘do I strike way, Copperfield? Really I did not know I had. But she extraordinarily dear girl herself, it is possible she may imparted something virtues me. Now mention it, Copperfield, I should not wonder all. I assure she always forgetting herself, taking care nine.’ ‘Is she eldest?’ I inquired. ‘Oh dear, no,’ said Traddles. ‘The eldest Beauty.’ He saw, I suppose, I could help smiling simplicity reply; added, smile upon his ingenuous face: ‘Not, course, Sophy--pretty name, Copperfield, I always think?’ ‘Very pretty!’ said I. ‘Not, course, Sophy beautiful eyes, would one dearest girls ever was, anybody’s eyes (I think). But I say eldest Beauty, I mean she really a--’ he seemed describing clouds himself, hands: ‘Splendid, know,’ said Traddles, energetically. ‘Indeed!’ said I. ‘Oh, I assure you,’ said Traddles, ‘something uncommon, indeed! Then, know, formed society admiration, able enjoy much consequence limited means, she naturally gets little irritable exacting, sometimes. Sophy puts her good humour!’ ‘Is Sophy youngest?’ I hazarded. ‘Oh dear, no!’ said Traddles, stroking his chin. ‘The two youngest nine ten. Sophy educates ‘them.’ ‘The second daughter, perhaps?’ I hazarded. ‘No,’ said Traddles. ‘Sarah’s second. Sarah something matter her spine, poor girl. The malady wear by, doctors say, meantime she lie twelvemonth. Sophy nurses her. Sophy’s fourth.’ ‘Is mother living?’ I inquired. ‘Oh yes,’ said Traddles, ‘she alive. She superior woman indeed, damp country adapted her constitution, and--in fact, she lost use her limbs.’ ‘Dear me!’ said I. ‘Very sad, not?’ returned Traddles. ‘But merely domestic view bad might be, Sophy takes her place. She quite much mother her mother, she nine.’ I felt greatest admiration virtues young lady; and, honestly view best prevent good-nature Traddles imposed upon, detriment joint prospects life, inquired Mr. Micawber was? ‘He quite well, Copperfield, thank you,’ said Traddles. ‘I living present.’ ‘No?’ ‘No. You see truth is,’ said Traddles, whisper, ‘he changed his name Mortimer, consequence his temporary embarrassments; he do not come till dark--and spectacles. There execution put house, rent. Mrs. Micawber dreadful state I really could not resist giving name second bill spoke here. You may imagine delightful feelings, Copperfield, see matter settled it, Mrs. Micawber recover her spirits.’ ‘Hum!’ said I. ‘Not her happiness long duration,’ pursued Traddles, ‘for, unfortunately, within week another execution came in. It broke establishment. I living furnished apartment since then, Mortimers private indeed. I hope will not think selfish, Copperfield, I mention broker carried little round table marble top, Sophy’s flower-pot stand?’ ‘What hard thing!’ I exclaimed indignantly. ‘It a--it pull,’ said Traddles, his usual wince expression. ‘I do not mention reproachfully, however, motive. The fact is, Copperfield, I unable repurchase time seizure; first place, broker, idea I wanted them, ran price extravagant extent; and, second place, I--had not money. Now, I kept eye since, upon broker’s shop,’ said Traddles, great enjoyment his mystery, ‘which top Tottenham Court Road, and, last, today I find put sale. I noticed way, broker saw me, bless you, he would ask price them! What occurred me, money, is, perhaps would not object ask good nurse come shop--I show her round corner next street--and make best bargain them, herself, she can!’ The delight Traddles propounded plan me, sense he uncommon artfulness, among freshest things remembrance. I told old nurse would delighted assist him, would three take field together, one condition. That condition was, he make solemn resolution grant loans his name, anything else, Mr. Micawber. ‘My dear Copperfield,’ said Traddles, ‘I already done so, I begin feel I inconsiderate, I positively unjust Sophy. My word passed myself, longer apprehension; I pledge you, too, greatest readiness. That first unlucky obligation, I paid. I doubt Mr. Micawber would paid he could, he could not. One thing I ought mention, I like much Mr. Micawber, Copperfield. It refers second obligation, yet due. He do not tell provided for, he says WILL BE. Now, I think something fair honest that!’ I unwilling damp good friend’s confidence, therefore assented. After little conversation, went round chandler’s shop, enlist Peggotty; Traddles declining pass evening me, he endured liveliest apprehensions his property would bought somebody else he could re-purchase it, evening he always devoted writing dearest girl world. I never shall forget peeping round corner street Tottenham Court Road, Peggotty bargaining precious articles; his agitation she came slowly towards us vainly offering price, hailed relenting broker, went back again. The end negotiation was, she bought property tolerably easy terms, Traddles transported pleasure. ‘I much obliged you, indeed,’ said Traddles, hearing sent he lived, night. ‘If I might ask one favour, I hope would think absurd, Copperfield?’ I said beforehand, certainly not. ‘Then WOULD good enough,’ said Traddles Peggotty, ‘to get flower-pot now, I think I like (it Sophy’s, Copperfield) carry home myself!’ Peggotty glad get him, he overwhelmed her thanks, went his way Tottenham Court Road, carrying flower-pot affectionately his arms, one delighted expressions countenance I ever saw. We turned back towards chambers. As shops charms Peggotty I never knew possess degree anybody else, I sauntered easily along, amused her staring windows, waiting her often she chose. We thus good getting Adelphi. On way upstairs, I called her attention sudden disappearance Mrs. Crupp’s pitfalls, also prints recent footsteps. We much surprised, coming higher up, find outer door standing open (which I shut) hear voices inside. We looked one another, without knowing make this, went sitting-room. What amazement find, people upon earth, aunt there, Mr. Dick! My aunt sitting quantity luggage, her two birds her, her cat her knee, like female Robinson Crusoe, drinking tea. Mr. Dick leaning thoughtfully great kite, often together fly, luggage piled him! ‘My dear aunt!’ cried I. ‘Why, unexpected pleasure!’ We cordially embraced; Mr. Dick I cordially shook hands; Mrs. Crupp, busy making tea, could attentive, cordially said she knowed well Mr. Copperfull would his heart his mouth, he see his dear relations. ‘Holloa!’ said aunt Peggotty, quailed her awful presence. ‘How YOU?’ ‘You remember aunt, Peggotty?’ said I. ‘For love goodness, child,’ exclaimed aunt, ‘do not call woman South Sea Island name! If she married got rid it, best thing she could do, do not give her benefit change? What is name now,--P?’ said aunt, compromise obnoxious appellation. ‘Barkis, madam,’ said Peggotty, curtsey. ‘Well! That is human,’ said aunt. ‘It sounds less wanted missionary. How d’ye do, Barkis? I hope you are well?’ Encouraged gracious words, aunt’s extending her hand, Barkis came forward, took hand, curtseyed her acknowledgements. ‘We older were, I see,’ said aunt. ‘We met before, know. A nice business made then! Trot, dear, another cup.’ I handed dutifully aunt, her usual inflexible state figure; ventured remonstrance her subject her sitting box. ‘Let draw sofa here, easy-chair, aunt,’ said I. ‘Why uncomfortable?’ ‘Thank you, Trot,’ replied aunt, ‘I prefer sit upon property.’ Here aunt looked hard Mrs. Crupp, observed, ‘We need not trouble wait, madam.’ ‘Shall I put little tea pot afore I go, madam?’ said Mrs. Crupp. ‘No, I thank you, madam,’ replied aunt. ‘Would let fetch another pat butter, madam?’ said Mrs. Crupp. ‘Or would persuaded try new-laid hegg? I brile rasher? Are not nothing I could dear aunt, Mr. Copperfull?’ ‘Nothing, madam,’ returned aunt. ‘I shall well, I thank you.’ Mrs. Crupp, incessantly smiling express sweet temper, incessantly holding her head one side, express general feebleness constitution, incessantly rubbing her hands, express desire service deserving objects, gradually smiled herself, one-sided herself, rubbed herself, room. ‘Dick!’ said aunt. ‘You know I told time-servers wealth-worshippers?’ Mr. Dick--with rather scared look, he forgotten it--returned hasty answer affirmative. ‘Mrs. Crupp one them,’ said aunt. ‘Barkis, I will trouble look tea, let another cup, I do not fancy woman’s pouring-out!’ I knew aunt sufficiently well know she something importance her mind, far matter arrival stranger might supposed. I noticed her eye lighted me, she thought attention otherwise occupied; curious process hesitation appeared going within her, she preserved her outward stiffness composure. I began reflect whether I done anything offend her; conscience whispered I yet told her Dora. Could means that, I wondered! As I knew she would speak her good time, I sat near her, spoke birds, played cat, easy I could be. But I far really easy; I still so, even Mr. Dick, leaning great kite behind aunt, taken every secret opportunity shaking his head darkly me, pointing her. ‘Trot,’ said aunt last, she finished her tea, carefully smoothed her dress, wiped her lips--‘you need not go, Barkis!--Trot, got firm self-reliant?’ ‘I hope so, aunt.’ ‘What think?’ inquired Miss Betsey. ‘I think so, aunt.’ ‘Then why, love,’ said aunt, looking earnestly me, ‘why think I prefer sit upon property mine tonight?’ I shook head, unable guess. ‘Because,’ said aunt, ‘it is I have. Because I am ruined, dear!’ If house, every one us, tumbled river together, I could hardly received greater shock. ‘Dick knows it,’ said aunt, laying her hand calmly shoulder. ‘I ruined, dear Trot! All I world room, except cottage; I left Janet let. Barkis, I want get bed gentleman tonight. To save expense, perhaps make something myself. Anything do. It is tonight. We will talk this, more, tomorrow.’ I roused amazement, concern her--I sure, her--by her falling neck, moment, crying she grieved me. In another moment she suppressed emotion; said aspect triumphant dejected: ‘We must meet reverses boldly, suffer frighten us, dear. We must learn act play out. We must live misfortune down, Trot!’ CHAPTER 35. DEPRESSION As soon I could recover presence mind, quite deserted first overpowering shock aunt’s intelligence, I proposed Mr. Dick come round chandler’s shop, take possession bed Mr. Peggotty lately vacated. The chandler’s shop Hungerford Market, Hungerford Market different place days, low wooden colonnade door (not unlike house little man woman used live, old weather-glass), pleased Mr. Dick mightily. The glory lodging structure would compensated him, I dare say, many inconveniences; but, really bear, beyond compound flavours I already mentioned, perhaps want little elbow-room, he perfectly charmed his accommodation. Mrs. Crupp indignantly assured was not room swing cat there; but, Mr. Dick justly observed me, sitting foot bed, nursing his leg, ‘You know, Trotwood, I do not want swing cat. I never swing cat. Therefore, signify ME!’ I tried ascertain whether Mr. Dick understanding causes sudden great change aunt’s affairs. As I might expected, he none all. The account he could give was, aunt said him, day yesterday, ‘Now, Dick, really truly philosopher I take for?’ That he said, Yes, he hoped so. That aunt said, ‘Dick, I ruined.’ That he said, ‘Oh, indeed!’ That aunt praised highly, he glad of. And come me, bottled porter sandwiches road. Mr. Dick complacent, sitting foot bed, nursing his leg, telling this, his eyes wide open surprised smile, I sorry say I provoked explaining ruin meant distress, want, starvation; I soon bitterly reproved harshness, seeing his face turn pale, tears course his lengthened cheeks, he fixed upon look unutterable woe, might softened far harder heart mine. I took infinitely greater pains cheer I taken depress him; I soon understood (as I ought known first) he confident, merely his faith wisest wonderful women, his unbounded reliance intellectual resources. The latter, I believe, he considered match kind disaster absolutely mortal. ‘What do, Trotwood?’ said Mr. Dick. ‘There is Memorial-’ ‘To sure is,’ said I. ‘But now, Mr. Dick, keep cheerful countenance, let aunt see thinking it.’ He assented earnest manner; implored me, I see wandering inch right course, recall superior methods always command. But I regret state fright I given proved much his best attempts concealment. All evening his eyes wandered aunt’s face, expression dismal apprehension, he saw her growing thin spot. He conscious this, put constraint upon his head; his keeping immovable, sitting rolling his eyes like piece machinery, mend matter all. I saw look loaf supper (which happened small one), nothing else stood us famine; aunt insisted his making his customary repast, I detected act pocketing fragments his bread cheese; I doubt purpose reviving us savings, reached advanced stage attenuation. My aunt, hand, composed frame mind, lesson us--to me, I sure. She extremely gracious Peggotty, except I inadvertently called her name; and, strange I knew she felt London, appeared quite home. She bed, I lie sitting-room, keep guard her. She made great point near river, case conflagration; I suppose really find satisfaction circumstance. ‘Trot, dear,’ said aunt, she saw making preparations compounding her usual night-draught, ‘No!’ ‘Nothing, aunt?’ ‘Not wine, dear. Ale.’ ‘But wine here, aunt. And always made wine.’ ‘Keep that, case sickness,’ said aunt. ‘We must not use carelessly, Trot. Ale me. Half pint.’ I thought Mr. Dick would fallen, insensible. My aunt resolute, I went got ale myself. As growing late, Peggotty Mr. Dick took opportunity repairing chandler’s shop together. I parted him, poor fellow, corner street, his great kite his back, monument human misery. My aunt walking room I returned, crimping borders her nightcap her fingers. I warmed ale made toast usual infallible principles. When ready her, she ready it, her nightcap on, skirt her gown turned back her knees. ‘My dear,’ said aunt, taking spoonful it; ‘it is great deal better wine. Not half bilious.’ I suppose I looked doubtful, she added: ‘Tut, tut, child. If nothing worse Ale happens us, well off.’ ‘I think myself, aunt, I sure,’ said I. ‘Well, then, DO NOT think so?’ said aunt. ‘Because I different people,’ I returned. ‘Stuff nonsense, Trot!’ replied aunt. My aunt went quiet enjoyment, little affectation, any; drinking warm ale tea-spoon, soaking her strips toast it. ‘Trot,’ said she, ‘I do not care strange faces general, I rather like Barkis yours, know!’ ‘It is better hundred pounds hear say so!’ said I. ‘It is extraordinary world,’ observed aunt, rubbing her nose; ‘how woman ever got name, unaccountable me. It would much easy born Jackson, something sort, one would think.’ ‘Perhaps she thinks so, too; it is her fault,’ said I. ‘I suppose not,’ returned aunt, rather grudging admission; ‘but it is aggravating. However, she is Barkis now. That is comfort. Barkis uncommonly fond you, Trot.’ ‘There nothing she would leave undone prove it,’ said I. ‘Nothing, I believe,’ returned aunt. ‘Here, poor fool begging praying handing her money--because she got much it. A simpleton!’ My aunt’s tears pleasure positively trickling warm ale. ‘She is ridiculous creature ever born,’ said aunt. ‘I knew, first moment I saw her poor dear blessed baby mother yours, she ridiculous mortals. But good points Barkis!’ Affecting laugh, she got opportunity putting her hand her eyes. Having availed herself it, she resumed her toast her discourse together. ‘Ah! Mercy upon us!’ sighed aunt. ‘I know it, Trot! Barkis quite gossip Dick. I know it. I do not know wretched girls expect go to, part. I wonder do not knock brains against--against mantelpieces,’ said aunt; idea probably suggested her her contemplation mine. ‘Poor Emily!’ said I. ‘Oh, do not talk poor,’ returned aunt. ‘She thought that, she caused much misery! Give kiss, Trot. I sorry early experience.’ As I bent forward, she put her tumbler knee detain me, said: ‘Oh, Trot, Trot! And fancy love! Do you?’ ‘Fancy, aunt!’ I exclaimed, red I could be. ‘I adore her whole soul!’ ‘Dora, indeed!’ returned aunt. ‘And mean say little thing fascinating, I suppose?’ ‘My dear aunt,’ I replied, ‘no one form least idea she is!’ ‘Ah! And silly?’ said aunt. ‘Silly, aunt!’ I seriously believe never entered head single moment, consider whether she not. I resented idea, course; I manner struck it, new one altogether. ‘Not light-headed?’ said aunt. ‘Light-headed, aunt!’ I could repeat daring speculation kind feeling I repeated preceding question. ‘Well, well!’ said aunt. ‘I ask. I do not depreciate her. Poor little couple! And think formed one another, go party-supper-table kind life, like two pretty pieces confectionery, you, Trot?’ She asked kindly, gentle air, half playful half sorrowful, I quite touched. ‘We young inexperienced, aunt, I know,’ I replied; ‘and I dare say say think good deal rather foolish. But love one another truly, I sure. If I thought Dora could ever love anybody else, cease love me; I could ever love anybody else, cease love her; I do not know I do--go mind, I think!’ ‘Ah, Trot!’ said aunt, shaking her head, smiling gravely; ‘blind, blind, blind!’ ‘Someone I know, Trot,’ aunt pursued, pause, ‘though pliant disposition, earnestness affection reminds poor Baby. Earnestness Somebody must look for, sustain improve him, Trot. Deep, downright, faithful earnestness.’ ‘If knew earnestness Dora, aunt!’ I cried. ‘Oh, Trot!’ she said again; ‘blind, blind!’ without knowing why, I felt vague unhappy loss want something overshadow like cloud. ‘However,’ said aunt, ‘I do not want put two young creatures conceit themselves, make unhappy; so, though girl boy attachment, girl boy attachments often--mind! I do not say always!--come nothing, still we will serious it, hope prosperous issue one days. There is time enough come anything!’ This upon whole comforting rapturous lover; I glad aunt confidence, I mindful her fatigued. So I thanked her ardently mark her affection, her kindnesses towards me; tender good night, she took her nightcap bedroom. How miserable I was, I lay down! How I thought thought poor, Mr. Spenlow’s eyes; I thought I was, I proposed Dora; chivalrous necessity telling Dora worldly condition was, releasing her her engagement she thought fit; I contrive live, long term articles, I earning nothing; something assist aunt, seeing way anything; coming money pocket, wear shabby coat, able carry Dora little presents, ride gallant greys, show agreeable light! Sordid selfish I knew was, I tortured knowing was, let mind run distress much, I devoted Dora I could help it. I knew base think aunt, less myself; but, far, selfishness inseparable Dora, I could put Dora one side mortal creature. How exceedingly miserable I was, night! As sleep, I dreams poverty sorts shapes, I seemed dream without previous ceremony going sleep. Now I ragged, wanting sell Dora matches, six bundles halfpenny; I office nightgown boots, remonstrated Mr. Spenlow appearing clients airy attire; I hungrily picking crumbs fell old Tiffey’s daily biscuit, regularly eaten St. Paul’s struck one; I hopelessly endeavouring get licence marry Dora, nothing one Uriah Heep’s gloves offer exchange, whole Commons rejected; still, less conscious room, I always tossing like distressed ship sea bed-clothes. My aunt restless, too, I frequently heard her walking fro. Two three times course night, attired long flannel wrapper she looked seven feet high, she appeared, like disturbed ghost, room, came side sofa I lay. On first occasion I started alarm, learn she inferred particular light sky, Westminster Abbey fire; consulted reference probability igniting Buckingham Street, case wind changed. Lying still, that, I found she sat near me, whispering herself ‘Poor boy!’ And made twenty times wretched, know unselfishly mindful she me, selfishly mindful I myself. It difficult believe night long me, could short anybody else. This consideration set thinking thinking imaginary party people dancing hours away, became dream too, I heard music incessantly playing one tune, saw Dora incessantly dancing one dance, without taking least notice me. The man playing harp night, trying vain cover ordinary-sized nightcap, I awoke; I rather say, I left trying go sleep, saw sun shining window last. There old Roman bath days bottom one streets Strand--it may still--in I many cold plunge. Dressing quietly I could, leaving Peggotty look aunt, I tumbled head foremost it, went walk Hampstead. I hope brisk treatment might freshen wits little; I think good, I soon came conclusion first step I ought take was, try articles could cancelled premium recovered. I got breakfast Heath, walked back Doctors’ Commons, along watered roads pleasant smell summer flowers, growing gardens carried town hucksters’ heads, intent first effort meet altered circumstances. I arrived office soon, all, I half hour’s loitering Commons, old Tiffey, always first, appeared his key. Then I sat shady corner, looking sunlight opposite chimney-pots, thinking Dora; Mr. Spenlow came in, crisp curly. ‘How you, Copperfield?’ said he. ‘Fine morning!’ ‘Beautiful morning, sir,’ said I. ‘Could I say word go Court?’ ‘By means,’ said he. ‘Come room.’ I followed his room, he began putting his gown, touching little glass he had, hanging inside closet door. ‘I sorry say,’ said I, ‘that I rather disheartening intelligence aunt.’ ‘No!’ said he. ‘Dear me! Not paralysis, I hope?’ ‘It reference her health, sir,’ I replied. ‘She met large losses. In fact, she little left, indeed.’ ‘You as-tound me, Copperfield!’ cried Mr. Spenlow. I shook head. ‘Indeed, sir,’ said I, ‘her affairs changed, I wished ask whether would possible--at sacrifice part portion premium, course,’ I put this, spur moment, warned blank expression his face--‘to cancel articles?’ What cost make proposal, nobody knows. It like asking, favour, sentenced transportation Dora. ‘To cancel articles, Copperfield? Cancel?’ I explained tolerable firmness, I really know means subsistence come from, unless I could earn myself. I fear future, I said--and I laid great emphasis that, imply I still decidedly eligible son-in-law one days--but, present, I thrown upon resources. ‘I extremely sorry hear this, Copperfield,’ said Mr. Spenlow. ‘Extremely sorry. It usual cancel articles reason. It professional course proceeding. It convenient precedent all. Far it. At time--’ ‘You good, sir,’ I murmured, anticipating concession. ‘Not all. Do not mention it,’ said Mr. Spenlow. ‘At time, I going say, lot hands unfettered--if I partner--Mr. Jorkins--’ My hopes dashed moment, I made another effort. ‘Do think, sir,’ said I, ‘if I mention Mr. Jorkins--’ Mr. Spenlow shook his head discouragingly. ‘Heaven forbid, Copperfield,’ he replied, ‘that I man injustice: still less, Mr. Jorkins. But I know partner, Copperfield. Mr. Jorkins man respond proposition peculiar nature. Mr. Jorkins difficult move beaten track. You know he is!’ I sure I knew nothing him, except he originally alone business, lived house near Montagu Square, fearfully want painting; he came late day, went away early; he never appeared consulted anything; he dingy little black-hole his upstairs, business ever done, yellow old cartridge-paper pad upon his desk, unsoiled ink, reported twenty years age. ‘Would object mentioning him, sir?’ I asked. ‘By means,’ said Mr. Spenlow. ‘But I experience Mr. Jorkins, Copperfield. I wish otherwise, I happy meet views respect. I cannot objection mentioning Mr. Jorkins, Copperfield, think worth while.’ Availing permission, given warm shake hand, I sat thinking Dora, looking sunlight stealing chimney-pots wall opposite house, Mr. Jorkins came. I went Mr. Jorkins’s room, evidently astonished Mr. Jorkins much making appearance there. ‘Come in, Mr. Copperfield,’ said Mr. Jorkins. ‘Come in!’ I went in, sat down; stated case Mr. Jorkins pretty much I stated Mr. Spenlow. Mr. Jorkins means awful creature one might expected, large, mild, smooth-faced man sixty, took much snuff tradition Commons he lived principally stimulant, little room his system article diet. ‘You mentioned Mr. Spenlow, I suppose?’ said Mr. Jorkins; he heard me, restlessly, end. I answered Yes, told Mr. Spenlow introduced his name. ‘He said I object?’ asked Mr. Jorkins. I obliged admit Mr. Spenlow considered probable. ‘I sorry say, Mr. Copperfield, I cannot advance object,’ said Mr. Jorkins, nervously. ‘The fact is--but I appointment Bank, you will goodness excuse me.’ With he rose great hurry, going room, I made bold say I feared, then, way arranging matter? ‘No!’ said Mr. Jorkins, stopping door shake his head. ‘Oh, no! I object, know,’ he said rapidly, went out. ‘You must aware, Mr. Copperfield,’ he added, looking restlessly door again, ‘if Mr. Spenlow objects--’ ‘Personally, he object, sir,’ said I. ‘Oh! Personally!’ repeated Mr. Jorkins, impatient manner. ‘I assure there is objection, Mr. Copperfield. Hopeless! What wish done, cannot done. I--I really got appointment Bank.’ With he fairly ran away; best knowledge, three days he showed Commons again. Being anxious leave stone unturned, I waited Mr. Spenlow came in, described passed; giving understand I hopeless his able soften adamantine Jorkins, he would undertake task. ‘Copperfield,’ returned Mr. Spenlow, gracious smile, ‘you known partner, Mr. Jorkins, long I have. Nothing farther thoughts attribute degree artifice Mr. Jorkins. But Mr. Jorkins way stating his objections often deceives people. No, Copperfield!’ shaking his head. ‘Mr. Jorkins moved, believe me!’ I completely bewildered Mr. Spenlow Mr. Jorkins, really objecting partner; I saw sufficient clearness obduracy somewhere firm, recovery aunt’s thousand pounds question. In state despondency, I remember anything satisfaction, I know still much reference (though always connexion Dora), I left office, went homeward. I trying familiarize mind worst, present arrangements make future sternest aspect, hackney-chariot coming me, stopping feet, occasioned look up. A fair hand stretched forth window; face I never seen without feeling serenity happiness, moment first turned back old oak staircase great broad balustrade, I associated softened beauty stained-glass window church, smiling me. ‘Agnes!’ I joyfully exclaimed. ‘Oh, dear Agnes, people world, pleasure see you!’ ‘Is it, indeed?’ she said, her cordial voice. ‘I want talk much!’ said I. ‘It is lightening heart, look you! If I conjuror’s cap, one I wished you!’ ‘What?’ returned Agnes. ‘Well! perhaps Dora first,’ I admitted, blush. ‘Certainly, Dora first, I hope,’ said Agnes, laughing. ‘But next!’ said I. ‘Where going?’ She going rooms see aunt. The day fine, she glad come chariot, smelt (I head time) like stable put cucumber-frame. I dismissed coachman, she took arm, walked together. She like Hope embodied, me. How different I felt one short minute, Agnes side! My aunt written her one odd, abrupt notes--very little longer Bank note--to her epistolary efforts usually limited. She stated therein she fallen adversity, leaving Dover good, quite made her mind it, well nobody need uncomfortable her. Agnes come London see aunt, herself mutual liking many years: indeed, dated time taking residence Mr. Wickfield’s house. She alone, she said. Her papa her--and Uriah Heep. ‘And partners,’ said I. ‘Confound him!’ ‘Yes,’ said Agnes. ‘They business here; I took advantage coming, come too. You must think visit friendly disinterested, Trotwood, for--I afraid I may cruelly prejudiced--I like let papa go away alone, him.’ ‘Does he exercise influence Mr. Wickfield still, Agnes?’ Agnes shook her head. ‘There change home,’ said she, ‘that would scarcely know dear old house. They live us now.’ ‘They?’ said I. ‘Mr. Heep his mother. He sleeps old room,’ said Agnes, looking face. ‘I wish I ordering his dreams,’ said I. ‘He would not sleep long.’ ‘I keep little room,’ said Agnes, ‘where I used learn lessons. How time goes! You remember? The little panelled room opens drawing-room?’ ‘Remember, Agnes? When I saw you, first time, coming door, quaint little basket keys hanging side?’ ‘It same,’ said Agnes, smiling. ‘I glad think pleasantly. We happy.’ ‘We were, indeed,’ said I. ‘I keep room still; I cannot always desert Mrs. Heep, know. And so,’ said Agnes, quietly, ‘I feel obliged bear her company, I might prefer alone. But I reason complain her. If she tires me, sometimes, her praises her son, natural mother. He good son her.’ I looked Agnes she said words, without detecting her consciousness Uriah’s design. Her mild earnest eyes met mine beautiful frankness, change her gentle face. ‘The chief evil presence house,’ said Agnes, ‘is I cannot near papa I could wish--Uriah Heep much us--and cannot watch him, bold thing say, closely I would. But fraud treachery practising him, I hope simple love truth strong end. I hope real love truth stronger end evil misfortune world.’ A certain bright smile, I never saw face, died away, even I thought good was, familiar me; she asked me, quick change expression (we drawing near street), I knew reverse aunt’s circumstances brought about. On replying no, she told yet, Agnes became thoughtful, I fancied I felt her arm tremble mine. We found aunt alone, state excitement. A difference opinion arisen herself Mrs. Crupp, abstract question (the propriety chambers inhabited gentler sex); aunt, utterly indifferent spasms part Mrs. Crupp, cut dispute short, informing lady she smelt brandy, she would trouble her walk out. Both expressions Mrs. Crupp considered actionable, expressed her intention bringing ‘British Judy’--meaning, supposed, bulwark national liberties. My aunt, however, time cool, Peggotty showing Mr. Dick soldiers Horse Guards--and being, besides, greatly pleased see Agnes--rather plumed herself affair otherwise, received us unimpaired good humour. When Agnes laid her bonnet table, sat beside her, I could think, looking her mild eyes her radiant forehead, natural seemed her there; trustfully, although she young inexperienced, aunt confided her; strong she was, indeed, simple love truth. We began talk aunt’s losses, I told I tried morning. ‘Which injudicious, Trot,’ said aunt, ‘but well meant. You generous boy--I suppose I must say, young man, now--and I proud you, dear. So far, good. Now, Trot Agnes, let us look case Betsey Trotwood face, see stands.’ I observed Agnes turn pale, she looked attentively aunt. My aunt, patting her cat, looked attentively Agnes. ‘Betsey Trotwood,’ said aunt, always kept her money matters herself. ‘--I do not mean sister, Trot, dear, myself--had certain property. It do not matter much; enough live on. More; she saved little, added it. Betsey funded her property time, then, advice her man business, laid landed security. That well, returned good interest, till Betsey paid off. I talking Betsey she man-of-war. Well! Then, Betsey look her, new investment. She thought she wiser, now, her man business, good man business time, he used be--I alluding father, Agnes--and she took her head lay herself. So she took her pigs,’ said aunt, ‘to foreign market; bad market turned be. First, she lost mining way, she lost diving way--fishing treasure, Tom Tiddler nonsense,’ explained aunt, rubbing her nose; ‘and she lost mining way again, and, last all, set thing entirely rights, she lost banking way. I do not know Bank shares worth little while,’ said aunt; ‘cent per cent lowest it, I believe; Bank end world, tumbled space, I know; anyhow, fell pieces, never never pay sixpence; Betsey’s sixpences there, there is end them. Least said, soonest mended!’ My aunt concluded philosophical summary, fixing her eyes kind triumph Agnes, whose colour gradually returning. ‘Dear Miss Trotwood, history?’ said Agnes. ‘I hope it is enough, child,’ said aunt. ‘If money lose, would not all, I dare say. Betsey would contrived throw rest, make another chapter, I little doubt. But money, there is story.’ Agnes listened first suspended breath. Her colour still came went, she breathed freely. I thought I knew why. I thought she fear her unhappy father might way blame happened. My aunt took her hand hers, laughed. ‘Is all?’ repeated aunt. ‘Why, yes, that is all, except, “And she lived happy ever afterwards.” Perhaps I may add Betsey yet, one days. Now, Agnes, wise head. So you, Trot, things, though I cannot compliment always’; aunt shook her me, energy peculiar herself. ‘What is done? Here is cottage, taking one time another, produce say seventy pounds year. I think may safely put that. Well!--That is we have got,’ said aunt; idiosyncrasy, horses, stop short she appeared fair way going long while. ‘Then,’ said aunt, rest, ‘there is Dick. He is good hundred a-year, course must expended himself. I would sooner send away, though I know I person appreciates him, him, spend his money himself. How Trot I best, upon means? What say, Agnes?’ ‘I say, aunt,’ I interposed, ‘that I must something!’ ‘Go soldier, mean?’ returned aunt, alarmed; ‘or go sea? I will not hear it. You proctor. We are going knockings head THIS family, please, sir.’ I explain I desirous introducing mode provision family, Agnes inquired rooms held long term? ‘You come point, dear,’ said aunt. ‘They got rid of, six months least, unless could underlet, I do not believe. The last man died here. Five people six would die--of course--of woman nankeen flannel petticoat. I little ready money; I agree you, best thing do, is, live term here, get bedroom hard by.’ I thought duty hint discomfort aunt would sustain, living continual state guerilla warfare Mrs. Crupp; she disposed objection summarily declaring that, first demonstration hostilities, she prepared astonish Mrs. Crupp whole remainder her natural life. ‘I thinking, Trotwood,’ said Agnes, diffidently, ‘that time--’ ‘I good deal time, Agnes. I always disengaged four five of the clock, I time early morning. In one way another,’ said I, conscious reddening little I thought hours hours I devoted fagging town, fro upon Norwood Road, ‘I abundance time.’ ‘I know would mind,’ said Agnes, coming me, speaking low voice, full sweet hopeful consideration I hear now, ‘the duties secretary.’ ‘Mind, dear Agnes?’ ‘Because,’ continued Agnes, ‘Doctor Strong acted his intention retiring, come live London; he asked papa, I know, he could recommend one. Do not think he would rather his favourite old pupil near him, anybody else?’ ‘Dear Agnes!’ said I. ‘What I without you! You always good angel. I told so. I never think light.’ Agnes answered her pleasant laugh, one good Angel (meaning Dora) enough; went remind Doctor used occupy his study, early morning, evening--and probably leisure would suit his requirements well. I scarcely delighted prospect earning bread, hope earning old master; short, acting advice Agnes, I sat wrote letter Doctor, stating object, appointing call next day ten forenoon. This I addressed Highgate--for place, memorable me, he lived--and went posted, myself, without losing minute. Wherever Agnes was, agreeable token her noiseless presence seemed inseparable place. When I came back, I found aunt’s birds hanging, hung long parlour window cottage; easy-chair imitating aunt’s much easier chair position open window; even round green fan, aunt brought away her, screwed window-sill. I knew done this, seeming quietly done itself; I known moment arranged neglected books old order school days, even I supposed Agnes miles away, instead seeing her busy them, smiling disorder fallen. My aunt quite gracious subject Thames (it really look well sun upon it, though like sea cottage), she could relent towards London smoke, which, she said, ‘peppered everything’. A complete revolution, Peggotty bore prominent part, effected every corner rooms, regard pepper; I looking on, thinking little even Peggotty seemed good deal bustle, much Agnes without bustle all, knock came door. ‘I think,’ said Agnes, turning pale, ‘it is papa. He promised he would come.’ I opened door, admitted, Mr. Wickfield, Uriah Heep. I seen Mr. Wickfield time. I prepared great change him, I heard Agnes, his appearance shocked me. It he looked many years older, though still dressed old scrupulous cleanliness; unwholesome ruddiness upon his face; his eyes full bloodshot; nervous trembling his hand, I knew, years seen work. It he lost his good looks, his old bearing gentleman--for he not--but thing struck most, was, evidences his native superiority still upon him, he submit crawling impersonation meanness, Uriah Heep. The reversal two natures, relative positions, Uriah’s power Mr. Wickfield’s dependence, sight painful I express. If I seen Ape taking command Man, I hardly thought degrading spectacle. He appeared conscious himself. When he came in, he stood still; his head bowed, he felt it. This moment; Agnes softly said him, ‘Papa! Here Miss Trotwood--and Trotwood, seen long while!’ he approached, constrainedly gave aunt his hand, shook hands cordially me. In moment’s pause I speak of, I saw Uriah’s countenance form ill-favoured smile. Agnes saw too, I think, she shrank him. What aunt saw, see, I defy science physiognomy made out, without her consent. I believe never anybody imperturbable countenance she chose. Her face might dead-wall occasion question, light threw upon her thoughts; she broke silence her usual abruptness. ‘Well, Wickfield!’ said aunt; he looked her first time. ‘I telling daughter well I disposing money myself, I could not trust you, growing rusty business matters. We taking counsel together, getting well, things considered. Agnes worth whole firm, opinion.’ ‘If I may umbly make remark,’ said Uriah Heep, writhe, ‘I fully agree Miss Betsey Trotwood, appy Miss Agnes partner.’ ‘You are partner yourself, know,’ returned aunt, ‘and that is enough you, I expect. How find yourself, sir?’ In acknowledgement question, addressed extraordinary curtness, Mr. Heep, uncomfortably clutching blue bag he carried, replied he pretty well, he thanked aunt, hoped she same. ‘And you, Master--I say, Mister Copperfield,’ pursued Uriah. ‘I hope I see well! I rejoiced see you, Mister Copperfield, even present circumstances.’ I believed that; he seemed relish much. ‘Present circumstances friends would wish you, Mister Copperfield, is not money makes man: it is--I really unequal umble powers express is,’ said Uriah, fawning jerk, ‘but is not money!’ Here he shook hands me: common way, standing good distance me, lifting hand like pump handle, he little afraid of. ‘And think looking, Master Copperfield,--I say, Mister?’ fawned Uriah. ‘Do not find Mr. Wickfield blooming, sir? Years do not tell much firm, Master Copperfield, except raising umble, namely, mother self--and developing,’ he added, afterthought, ‘the beautiful, namely, Miss Agnes.’ He jerked about, compliment, intolerable manner, aunt, sat looking straight him, lost patience. ‘Deuce take man!’ said aunt, sternly, ‘what is he about? Do not galvanic, sir!’ ‘I ask pardon, Miss Trotwood,’ returned Uriah; ‘I am aware you are nervous.’ ‘Go along you, sir!’ said aunt, anything appeased. ‘Do not presume say so! I nothing sort. If you are eel, sir, conduct like one. If you are man, control limbs, sir! Good God!’ said aunt, great indignation, ‘I going serpentined corkscrewed senses!’ Mr. Heep rather abashed, people might been, explosion; derived great additional force indignant manner aunt afterwards moved her chair, shook her head she making snaps bounces him. But he said aside meek voice: ‘I well aware, Master Copperfield, Miss Trotwood, though excellent lady, quick temper (indeed I think I pleasure knowing her, I numble clerk, did, Master Copperfield), it is natural, I sure, made quicker present circumstances. The wonder is, is not much worse! I called say anything could do, present circumstances, mother self, Wickfield Heep,--we really glad. I may go far?’ said Uriah, sickly smile his partner. ‘Uriah Heep,’ said Mr. Wickfield, monotonous forced way, ‘is active business, Trotwood. What he says, I quite concur in. You know I old interest you. Apart that, Uriah says I quite concur in!’ ‘Oh, reward is,’ said Uriah, drawing one leg, risk bringing upon another visitation aunt, ‘to trusted in! But I hope I able something relieve fatigues business, Master Copperfield!’ ‘Uriah Heep great relief me,’ said Mr. Wickfield, dull voice. ‘It is load mind, Trotwood, partner.’ The red fox made say this, I knew, exhibit light he indicated night he poisoned rest. I saw ill-favoured smile upon his face again, saw he watched me. ‘You going, papa?’ said Agnes, anxiously. ‘Will walk back Trotwood me?’ He would looked Uriah, I believe, replying, worthy anticipated him. ‘I bespoke myself,’ said Uriah, ‘on business; otherwise I appy kept friends. But I leave partner represent firm. Miss Agnes, ever yours! I wish good-day, Master Copperfield, leave umble respects Miss Betsey Trotwood.’ With words, he retired, kissing his great hand, leering us like mask. We sat there, talking pleasant old Canterbury days, hour two. Mr. Wickfield, left Agnes, soon became like his former self; though settled depression upon him, he never shook off. For that, he brightened; evident pleasure hearing us recall little incidents old life, many he remembered well. He said like times, alone Agnes again; he wished Heaven never changed. I sure influence placid face Agnes, touch her hand upon his arm, wonders him. My aunt (who busy nearly Peggotty, inner room) would accompany us place staying, insisted going; I went. We dined together. After dinner, Agnes sat beside him, old, poured his wine. He took she gave him, more--like child--and three sat together window evening gathered in. When almost dark, he lay sofa, Agnes pillowing his head bending little while; she came back window, dark I could see tears glittering her eyes. I pray Heaven I never may forget dear girl her love truth, time life; I should, I must drawing near end, I would desire remember her best! She filled heart good resolutions, strengthened weakness so, her example, directed--I know how, she modest gentle advise many words--the wandering ardour unsettled purpose within me, little good I done, harm I forborne, I solemnly believe I may refer her. And she spoke Dora, sitting window dark; listened praises her; praised again; round little fairy-figure she would glimpses her pure light, made yet precious innocent me! Oh, Agnes, sister boyhood, I known then, I knew long afterwards--! There beggar street, I went down; I turned head towards window, thinking her calm seraphic eyes, he made start muttering, he echo morning: ‘Blind! Blind! Blind!’ CHAPTER 36. ENTHUSIASM I began next day another dive Roman bath, started Highgate. I dispirited now. I afraid shabby coat, yearnings gallant greys. My whole manner thinking late misfortune changed. What I do, was, show aunt her past goodness thrown away insensible, ungrateful object. What I do, was, turn painful discipline younger days account, going work resolute steady heart. What I do, was, take woodman’s axe hand, clear way forest difficulty, cutting trees I came Dora. And I went mighty rate, could done walking. When I found familiar Highgate road, pursuing different errand old one pleasure, associated, seemed complete change come whole life. But discourage me. With new life, came new purpose, new intention. Great labour; priceless reward. Dora reward, Dora must won. I got transport, I felt quite sorry coat little shabby already. I wanted cutting trees forest difficulty, circumstances prove strength. I good mind ask old man, wire spectacles, breaking stones upon road, lend his hammer little while, let begin beat path Dora granite. I stimulated heat, got breath, I felt I earning I do not know much. In state, I went cottage I saw let, examined narrowly,--for I felt necessary practical. It would Dora admirably: little front garden Jip run in, bark tradespeople railings, capital room upstairs aunt. I came again, hotter faster ever, dashed Highgate, rate I hour early; and, though I been, obliged stroll cool myself, I presentable. My first care, putting necessary course preparation, find Doctor’s house. It part Highgate Mrs. Steerforth lived, quite opposite side little town. When I made discovery, I went back, attraction I could resist, lane Mrs. Steerforth’s, looked corner garden wall. His room shut close. The conservatory doors standing open, Rosa Dartle walking, bareheaded, quick, impetuous step, gravel walk one side lawn. She gave idea fierce thing, dragging length chain fro upon beaten track, wearing heart out. I came softly away place observation, avoiding part neighbourhood, wishing I gone near it, strolled ten of the clock. The church slender spire, stands top hill now, tell time. An old red-brick mansion, used school, place; fine old house must go school at, I recollect it. When I approached Doctor’s cottage--a pretty old place, he seemed expended money, I might judge embellishments repairs look completed--I saw walking garden side, gaiters all, he never left walking since days pupilage. He his old companions him, too; plenty high trees neighbourhood, two three rooks grass, looking him, written Canterbury rooks, observing closely consequence. Knowing utter hopelessness attracting his attention distance, I made bold open gate, walk him, meet he turn round. When he did, came towards me, he looked thoughtfully moments, evidently without thinking all; his benevolent face expressed extraordinary pleasure, he took hands. ‘Why, dear Copperfield,’ said Doctor, ‘you man! How do? I delighted see you. My dear Copperfield, much improved! You quite--yes--dear me!’ I hoped he well, Mrs. Strong too. ‘Oh dear, yes!’ said Doctor; ‘Annie’s quite well, she will delighted see you. You always her favourite. She said so, last night, I showed her letter. And--yes, sure--you recollect Mr. Jack Maldon, Copperfield?’ ‘Perfectly, sir.’ ‘Of course,’ said Doctor. ‘To sure. He is pretty well, too.’ ‘Has he come home, sir?’ I inquired. ‘From India?’ said Doctor. ‘Yes. Mr. Jack Maldon could not bear climate, dear. Mrs. Markleham--you forgotten Mrs. Markleham?’ Forgotten Old Soldier! And short time! ‘Mrs. Markleham,’ said Doctor, ‘was quite vexed him, poor thing; got home again; bought little Patent place, agrees much better.’ I knew enough Mr. Jack Maldon suspect account place much do, pretty well paid. The Doctor, walking his hand shoulder, his kind face turned encouragingly mine, went on: ‘Now, dear Copperfield, reference proposal yours. It is gratifying agreeable me, I sure; do not think could better? You achieved distinction, know, us. You qualified many good things. You laid foundation edifice may raised upon; pity devote spring-time life poor pursuit I offer?’ I became glowing again, and, expressing rhapsodical style, I afraid, urged request strongly; reminding Doctor I already profession. ‘Well, well,’ said Doctor, ‘that is true. Certainly, profession, actually engaged studying it, makes difference. But, good young friend, what is seventy pounds year?’ ‘It doubles income, Doctor Strong,’ said I. ‘Dear me!’ replied Doctor. ‘To think that! Not I mean say it is rigidly limited seventy pounds a-year, I always contemplated making young friend I might thus employ, present too. Undoubtedly,’ said Doctor, still walking his hand shoulder. ‘I always taken annual present account.’ ‘My dear tutor,’ said I (now, really, without nonsense), ‘to I owe obligations already I ever acknowledge--’ ‘No, no,’ interposed Doctor. ‘Pardon me!’ ‘If take time I have, mornings evenings, think worth seventy pounds year, service I cannot express.’ ‘Dear me!’ said Doctor, innocently. ‘To think little go much! Dear, dear! And better, will? On word, now?’ said Doctor,--which he always made grave appeal honour us boys. ‘On word, sir!’ I returned, answering old school manner. ‘Then so,’ said Doctor, clapping shoulder, still keeping his hand there, still walked down. ‘And I shall twenty times happier, sir,’ said I, little--I hope innocent--flattery, ‘if employment Dictionary.’ The Doctor stopped, smilingly clapped shoulder again, exclaimed, triumph delightful behold, I penetrated profoundest depths mortal sagacity, ‘My dear young friend, hit it. It IS Dictionary!’ How could anything else! His pockets full his head. It sticking directions. He told since his retirement scholastic life, he advancing wonderfully; nothing could suit better proposed arrangements morning evening work, his custom walk daytime his considering cap on. His papers little confusion, consequence Mr. Jack Maldon lately proffered his occasional services amanuensis, accustomed occupation; soon put right amiss, go swimmingly. Afterwards, fairly work, I found Mr. Jack Maldon’s efforts troublesome I expected, he confined making numerous mistakes, sketched many soldiers, ladies’ heads, Doctor’s manuscript, I often became involved labyrinths obscurity. The Doctor quite happy prospect going work together wonderful performance, settled begin next morning seven of the clock. We work two hours every morning, two three hours every night, except Saturdays, I rest. On Sundays, course, I rest also, I considered easy terms. Our plans thus arranged mutual satisfaction, Doctor took house present Mrs. Strong, found Doctor’s new study, dusting his books,--a freedom he never permitted anybody else take sacred favourites. They postponed breakfast account, sat table together. We seated long, I saw approaching arrival Mrs. Strong’s face, I heard sound it. A gentleman horseback came gate, leading his horse little court, bridle his arm, he quite home, tied ring empty coach-house wall, came breakfast parlour, whip hand. It Mr. Jack Maldon; Mr. Jack Maldon improved India, I thought. I state ferocious virtue, however, young men cutting trees forest difficulty; impression must received due allowance. ‘Mr. Jack!’ said Doctor. ‘Copperfield!’ Mr. Jack Maldon shook hands me; warmly, I believed; air languid patronage, I secretly took great umbrage. But his languor altogether quite wonderful sight; except he addressed his cousin Annie. ‘Have breakfasted morning, Mr. Jack?’ said Doctor. ‘I hardly ever take breakfast, sir,’ he replied, his head thrown back easy-chair. ‘I find bores me.’ ‘Is news today?’ inquired Doctor. ‘Nothing all, sir,’ replied Mr. Maldon. ‘There is account people hungry discontented North, always hungry discontented somewhere.’ The Doctor looked grave, said, though he wished change subject, ‘Then there is news all; news, say, good news.’ ‘There is long statement papers, sir, murder,’ observed Mr. Maldon. ‘But somebody always murdered, I did not read it.’ A display indifference actions passions mankind supposed distinguished quality time, I think, I observed considered since. I known fashionable indeed. I seen displayed success, I encountered fine ladies gentlemen might well born caterpillars. Perhaps impressed then, new me, certainly tend exalt opinion of, strengthen confidence in, Mr. Jack Maldon. ‘I came inquire whether Annie would like go opera tonight,’ said Mr. Maldon, turning her. ‘It is last good night be, season; there is singer there, she really ought hear. She perfectly exquisite. Besides which, she charmingly ugly,’ relapsing languor. The Doctor, ever pleased likely please his young wife, turned her said: ‘You must go, Annie. You must go.’ ‘I would rather not,’ she said Doctor. ‘I prefer remain home. I would much rather remain home.’ Without looking her cousin, she addressed me, asked Agnes, whether she see her, whether she likely come day; much disturbed, I wondered even Doctor, buttering his toast, could blind obvious. But he saw nothing. He told her, good-naturedly, she young ought amused entertained, must allow herself made dull dull old fellow. Moreover, he said, he wanted hear her sing new singer’s songs him; could she well, unless she went? So Doctor persisted making engagement her, Mr. Jack Maldon come back dinner. This concluded, he went his Patent place, I suppose; events went away his horse, looking idle. I curious find next morning, whether she been. She not, sent London put her cousin off; gone afternoon see Agnes, prevailed upon Doctor go her; walked home fields, Doctor told me, evening delightful. I wondered then, whether she would gone Agnes town, whether Agnes good influence her too! She look happy, I thought; good face, false one. I often glanced it, she sat window time work; made breakfast, took snatches employed. When I left, nine of the clock, she kneeling ground Doctor’s feet, putting his shoes gaiters him. There softened shade upon her face, thrown green leaves overhanging open window low room; I thought way Doctors’ Commons, night I seen looking he read. I pretty busy now; five morning, home nine ten night. But I infinite satisfaction closely engaged, never walked slowly account, felt enthusiastically I tired myself, I deserve Dora. I revealed altered character Dora yet, she coming see Miss Mills days, I deferred I tell her then; merely informing her letters (all communications secretly forwarded Miss Mills), I much tell her. In meantime, I put short allowance bear’s grease, wholly abandoned scented soap lavender water, sold three waistcoats prodigious sacrifice, luxurious stern career. Not satisfied proceedings, burning impatience something more, I went see Traddles, lodging behind parapet house Castle Street, Holborn. Mr. Dick, Highgate twice already, resumed his companionship Doctor, I took me. I took Mr. Dick me, because, acutely sensitive aunt’s reverses, sincerely believing galley-slave convict worked I did, he begun fret worry spirits appetite, nothing useful do. In condition, he felt incapable finishing Memorial ever; harder he worked it, oftener unlucky head King Charles First got it. Seriously apprehending his malady would increase, unless put innocent deception upon caused believe he useful, unless could put way really useful (which would better), I made mind try Traddles could help us. Before went, I wrote Traddles full statement happened, Traddles wrote back capital answer, expressive his sympathy friendship. We found hard work his inkstand papers, refreshed sight flower-pot stand little round table corner small apartment. He received us cordially, made friends Mr. Dick moment. Mr. Dick professed absolute certainty seen before, said, ‘Very likely.’ The first subject I consult Traddles this,--I heard many men distinguished various pursuits begun life reporting debates Parliament. Traddles mentioned newspapers me, one his hopes, I put two things together, told Traddles letter I wished know I could qualify pursuit. Traddles informed me, result his inquiries, mere mechanical acquisition necessary, except rare cases, thorough excellence it, say, perfect entire command mystery short-hand writing reading, equal difficulty mastery six languages; might perhaps attained, dint perseverance, course years. Traddles reasonably supposed would settle business; I, feeling indeed tall trees hewn down, immediately resolved work way Dora thicket, axe hand. ‘I much obliged you, dear Traddles!’ said I. ‘I will begin tomorrow.’ Traddles looked astonished, he well might; he notion yet rapturous condition. ‘I will buy book,’ said I, ‘with good scheme art it; I will work Commons, I have not half enough do; I will take speeches court practice--Traddles, dear fellow, I will master it!’ ‘Dear me,’ said Traddles, opening his eyes, ‘I idea determined character, Copperfield!’ I do not know he had, new enough me. I passed off, brought Mr. Dick carpet. ‘You see,’ said Mr. Dick, wistfully, ‘if I could exert myself, Mr. Traddles--if I could beat drum--or blow anything!’ Poor fellow! I little doubt he would preferred employment his heart others. Traddles, would smiled world, replied composedly: ‘But good penman, sir. You told so, Copperfield?’ ‘Excellent!’ said I. And indeed he was. He wrote extraordinary neatness. ‘Do not think,’ said Traddles, ‘you could copy writings, sir, I got you?’ Mr. Dick looked doubtfully me. ‘Eh, Trotwood?’ I shook head. Mr. Dick shook his, sighed. ‘Tell Memorial,’ said Mr. Dick. I explained Traddles difficulty keeping King Charles First Mr. Dick’s manuscripts; Mr. Dick meanwhile looking deferentially seriously Traddles, sucking his thumb. ‘But writings, know, I speak of, already drawn finished,’ said Traddles little consideration. ‘Mr. Dick nothing them. Would not make difference, Copperfield? At events, would not well try?’ This gave us new hope. Traddles I laying heads together apart, Mr. Dick anxiously watched us his chair, concocted scheme virtue got work next day, triumphant success. On table window Buckingham Street, set work Traddles procured him--which make, I forget many copies legal document right way--and another table spread last unfinished original great Memorial. Our instructions Mr. Dick he copy exactly he him, without least departure original; he felt necessary make slightest allusion King Charles First, he fly Memorial. We exhorted resolute this, left aunt observe him. My aunt reported us, afterwards, that, first, he like man playing kettle-drums, constantly divided his attentions two; that, finding confuse fatigue him, his copy there, plainly his eyes, he soon sat orderly business-like manner, postponed Memorial convenient time. In word, although took great care he good him, although he begin beginning week, he earned following Saturday night ten shillings nine-pence; never, I live, shall I forget his going shops neighbourhood change treasure sixpences, his bringing aunt arranged form heart upon waiter, tears joy pride his eyes. He like one propitious influence charm, moment his usefully employed; happy man world, Saturday night, grateful creature thought aunt wonderful woman existence, wonderful young man. ‘No starving now, Trotwood,’ said Mr. Dick, shaking hands corner. ‘I will provide her, Sir!’ he flourished his ten fingers air, ten banks. I hardly know better pleased, Traddles I. ‘It really,’ said Traddles, suddenly, taking letter his pocket, giving me, ‘put Mr. Micawber quite head!’ The letter (Mr. Micawber never missed possible opportunity writing letter) addressed me, ‘By kindness T. Traddles, Esquire, Inner Temple.’ It ran thus:-- ‘MY DEAR COPPERFIELD, ‘You may possibly unprepared receive intimation something turned up. I may mentioned former occasion I expectation event. ‘I establish one provincial towns favoured island (where society may described happy admixture agricultural clerical), immediate connexion one learned professions. Mrs. Micawber offspring accompany me. Our ashes, future period, probably found commingled cemetery attached venerable pile, spot I refer acquired reputation, shall I say China Peru? ‘In bidding adieu modern Babylon, undergone many vicissitudes, I trust ignobly, Mrs. Micawber cannot disguise minds part, may years may ever, individual linked strong associations altar domestic life. If, eve departure, accompany mutual friend, Mr. Thomas Traddles, present abode, reciprocate wishes natural occasion, confer Boon ‘On ‘One ‘Who ‘Is ‘Ever yours, ‘WILKINS MICAWBER.’ I glad find Mr. Micawber got rid his dust ashes, something really turned last. Learning Traddles invitation referred evening wearing away, I expressed readiness honour it; went together lodging Mr. Micawber occupied Mr. Mortimer, situated near top Gray’s Inn Road. The resources lodging limited, found twins, eight nine years old, reposing turn-up bedstead family sitting-room, Mr. Micawber prepared, wash-hand-stand jug, he called ‘a Brew’ agreeable beverage he famous. I pleasure, occasion, renewing acquaintance Master Micawber, I found promising boy twelve thirteen, subject restlessness limb unfrequent phenomenon youths his age. I also became known his sister, Miss Micawber, whom, Mr. Micawber told us, ‘her mother renewed her youth, like Phoenix’. ‘My dear Copperfield,’ said Mr. Micawber, ‘yourself Mr. Traddles find us brink migration, excuse little discomforts incidental position.’ Glancing round I made suitable reply, I observed family effects already packed, amount luggage means overwhelming. I congratulated Mrs. Micawber approaching change. ‘My dear Mr. Copperfield,’ said Mrs. Micawber, ‘of friendly interest affairs, I well assured. My family may consider banishment, please; I wife mother, I never desert Mr. Micawber.’ Traddles, appealed Mrs. Micawber’s eye, feelingly acquiesced. ‘That,’ said Mrs. Micawber, ‘that, least, view, dear Mr. Copperfield Mr. Traddles, obligation I took upon I repeated irrevocable words, “I, Emma, take thee, Wilkins.” I read service flat-candle previous night, conclusion I derived was, I never could desert Mr. Micawber. And,’ said Mrs. Micawber, ‘though possible I may mistaken view ceremony, I never will!’ ‘My dear,’ said Mr. Micawber, little impatiently, ‘I conscious expected anything sort.’ ‘I aware, dear Mr. Copperfield,’ pursued Mrs. Micawber, ‘that I cast lot among strangers; I also aware various members family, Mr. Micawber written gentlemanly terms, announcing fact, taken least notice Mr. Micawber’s communication. Indeed I may superstitious,’ said Mrs. Micawber, ‘but appears Mr. Micawber destined never receive answers whatever great majority communications he writes. I may augur, silence family, object resolution I taken; I allow swerved path duty, Mr. Copperfield, even papa mama, still living.’ I expressed opinion going right direction. ‘It may sacrifice,’ said Mrs. Micawber, ‘to immure one’s-self Cathedral town; surely, Mr. Copperfield, sacrifice me, much sacrifice man Mr. Micawber’s abilities.’ ‘Oh! You going Cathedral town?’ said I. Mr. Micawber, helping us all, wash-hand-stand jug, replied: ‘To Canterbury. In fact, dear Copperfield, I entered arrangements, virtue I stand pledged contracted friend Heep, assist serve capacity of--and be--his confidential clerk.’ I stared Mr. Micawber, greatly enjoyed surprise. ‘I bound state you,’ he said, official air, ‘that business habits, prudent suggestions, Mrs. Micawber, great measure conduced result. The gauntlet, Mrs. Micawber referred upon former occasion, thrown form advertisement, taken friend Heep, led mutual recognition. Of friend Heep,’ said Mr. Micawber, ‘who man remarkable shrewdness, I desire speak possible respect. My friend Heep fixed positive remuneration high figure, he made great deal, way extrication pressure pecuniary difficulties, contingent value services; value services I pin faith. Such address intelligence I chance possess,’ said Mr. Micawber, boastfully disparaging himself, old genteel air, ‘will devoted friend Heep’s service. I already acquaintance law--as defendant civil process--and I shall immediately apply Commentaries one eminent remarkable English jurists. I believe unnecessary add I allude Mr. justice Blackstone.’ These observations, indeed greater part observations made evening, interrupted Mrs. Micawber’s discovering Master Micawber sitting his boots, holding his head arms he felt loose, accidentally kicking Traddles table, shuffling his feet one another, producing distances apparently outrageous nature, lying sideways his hair among wine-glasses, developing his restlessness limb form incompatible general interests society; Master Micawber’s receiving discoveries resentful spirit. I sat while, amazed Mr. Micawber’s disclosure, wondering meant; Mrs. Micawber resumed thread discourse, claimed attention. ‘What I particularly request Mr. Micawber careful of, is,’ said Mrs. Micawber, ‘that he not, dear Mr. Copperfield, applying subordinate branch law, place his power rise, ultimately, top tree. I convinced Mr. Micawber, giving his mind profession adapted his fertile resources, his flow language, must distinguish himself. Now, example, Mr. Traddles,’ said Mrs. Micawber, assuming profound air, ‘a judge, even say Chancellor. Does individual place beyond pale preferments entering office Mr. Micawber accepted?’ ‘My dear,’ observed Mr. Micawber--but glancing inquisitively Traddles, too; ‘we time enough us, consideration questions.’ ‘Micawber,’ she returned, ‘no! Your mistake life is, look forward far enough. You bound, justice family, yourself, take comprehensive glance extremest point horizon abilities may lead you.’ Mr. Micawber coughed, drank his punch air exceeding satisfaction--still glancing Traddles, he desired his opinion. ‘Why, plain state case, Mrs. Micawber,’ said Traddles, mildly breaking truth her. ‘I mean real prosaic fact, know--’ ‘Just so,’ said Mrs. Micawber, ‘my dear Mr. Traddles, I wish prosaic literal possible subject much importance.’ ‘--Is,’ said Traddles, ‘that branch law, even Mr. Micawber regular solicitor--’ ‘Exactly so,’ returned Mrs. Micawber. [‘Wilkins, squinting, able get eyes back.’) ‘--Has nothing,’ pursued Traddles, ‘to that. Only barrister eligible preferments; Mr. Micawber could barrister, without entered inn court student, five years.’ ‘Do I follow you?’ said Mrs. Micawber, her affable air business. ‘Do I understand, dear Mr. Traddles, that, expiration period, Mr. Micawber would eligible Judge Chancellor?’ ‘He would ELIGIBLE,’ returned Traddles, strong emphasis word. ‘Thank you,’ said Mrs. Micawber. ‘That quite sufficient. If case, Mr. Micawber forfeits privilege entering duties, anxiety set rest. I speak,’ said Mrs. Micawber, ‘as female, necessarily; I always opinion Mr. Micawber possesses I heard papa call, I lived home, judicial mind; I hope Mr. Micawber entering field mind develop itself, take commanding station.’ I quite believe Mr. Micawber saw himself, his judicial mind’s eye, woolsack. He passed his hand complacently his bald head, said ostentatious resignation: ‘My dear, anticipate decrees fortune. If I reserved wear wig, I least prepared, externally,’ allusion his baldness, ‘for distinction. I not,’ said Mr. Micawber, ‘regret hair, I may deprived specific purpose. I cannot say. It intention, dear Copperfield, educate son Church; I deny I happy, his account, attain eminence.’ ‘For Church?’ said I, still pondering, whiles, Uriah Heep. ‘Yes,’ said Mr. Micawber. ‘He remarkable head-voice, commence chorister. Our residence Canterbury, local connexion, will, doubt, enable take advantage vacancy may arise Cathedral corps.’ On looking Master Micawber again, I saw he certain expression face, his voice behind his eyebrows; presently appeared be, his singing us (as alternative bed) ‘The Wood-Pecker tapping’. After many compliments performance, fell general conversation; I full desperate intentions keep altered circumstances myself, I made known Mr. Mrs. Micawber. I cannot express extremely delighted were, idea aunt’s difficulties; comfortable friendly made them. When nearly come last round punch, I addressed Traddles, reminded must separate, without wishing friends health, happiness, success new career. I begged Mr. Micawber fill us bumpers, proposed toast due form: shaking hands across table, kissing Mrs. Micawber, commemorate eventful occasion. Traddles imitated first particular, consider sufficiently old friend venture second. ‘My dear Copperfield,’ said Mr. Micawber, rising one his thumbs his waistcoat pockets, ‘the companion youth: I may allowed expression--and esteemed friend Traddles: I may permitted call so--will allow me, part Mrs. Micawber, myself, offspring, thank warmest uncompromising terms good wishes. It may expected eve migration consign us perfectly new existence,’ Mr. Micawber spoke going five hundred thousand miles, ‘I offer valedictory remarks two friends I see me. But I say way, I said. Whatever station society I may attain, medium learned profession I become unworthy member, I shall endeavour disgrace, Mrs. Micawber safe adorn. Under temporary pressure pecuniary liabilities, contracted view immediate liquidation, remaining unliquidated combination circumstances, I necessity assuming garb natural instincts recoil--I allude spectacles--and possessing cognomen, I establish legitimate pretensions. All I say score is, cloud passed dreary scene, God Day high upon mountain tops. On Monday next, arrival four of the clock afternoon coach Canterbury, foot native heath--my name, Micawber!’ Mr. Micawber resumed his seat close remarks, drank two glasses punch grave succession. He said much solemnity: ‘One thing I do, separation complete, perform act justice. My friend Mr. Thomas Traddles has, two several occasions, “put his name”, I may use common expression, bills exchange accommodation. On first occasion Mr. Thomas Traddles left--let say, short, lurch. The fulfilment second yet arrived. The amount first obligation,’ Mr. Micawber carefully referred papers, ‘was, I believe, twenty-three, four, nine half, second, according entry transaction, eighteen, six, two. These sums, united, make total, calculation correct, amounting forty-one, ten, eleven half. My friend Copperfield perhaps favour check total?’ I found correct. ‘To leave metropolis,’ said Mr. Micawber, ‘and friend Mr. Thomas Traddles, without acquitting pecuniary part obligation, would weigh upon mind insupportable extent. I have, therefore, prepared friend Mr. Thomas Traddles, I hold hand, document, accomplishes desired object. I beg hand friend Mr. Thomas Traddles I.O.YOU. forty-one, ten, eleven half, I happy recover moral dignity, know I walk erect fellow man!’ With introduction (which greatly affected him), Mr. Micawber placed his I.O.YOU. hands Traddles, said he wished well every relation life. I persuaded, quite Mr. Micawber paying money, Traddles hardly knew difference he time think it. Mr. Micawber walked erect his fellow man, strength virtuous action, his chest looked half broad he lighted us downstairs. We parted great heartiness sides; I seen Traddles his door, going home alone, I thought, among odd contradictory things I mused upon, that, slippery Mr. Micawber was, I probably indebted compassionate recollection he retained his boy-lodger, never asked money. I certainly moral courage refuse it; I doubt he knew (to his credit written), quite well I did. CHAPTER 37. A LITTLE COLD WATER My new life lasted week, I stronger ever tremendous practical resolutions I felt crisis required. I continued walk extremely fast, general idea I getting on. I made rule take much I possibly could, way everything I applied energies. I made perfect victim myself. I even entertained idea putting vegetable diet, vaguely conceiving that, becoming graminivorous animal, I sacrifice Dora. As yet, little Dora quite unconscious desperate firmness, otherwise letters darkly shadowed forth. But another Saturday came, Saturday evening she Miss Mills’s; Mr. Mills gone his whist-club (telegraphed street, bird-cage drawing-room middle window), I go tea. By time, quite settled Buckingham Street, Mr. Dick continued his copying state absolute felicity. My aunt obtained signal victory Mrs. Crupp, paying her off, throwing first pitcher she planted stairs window, protecting person, staircase, supernumerary she engaged outer world. These vigorous measures struck terror breast Mrs. Crupp, she subsided her kitchen, impression aunt mad. My aunt supremely indifferent Mrs. Crupp’s opinion everybody else’s, rather favouring discouraging idea, Mrs. Crupp, late bold, became within days faint-hearted, rather encounter aunt upon staircase, she would endeavour hide her portly form behind doors--leaving visible, however, wide margin flannel petticoat--or would shrink dark corners. This gave aunt unspeakable satisfaction, I believe she took delight prowling down, her bonnet insanely perched top her head, times Mrs. Crupp likely way. My aunt, uncommonly neat ingenious, made many little improvements domestic arrangements, I seemed richer instead poorer. Among rest, she converted pantry dressing-room me; purchased embellished bedstead occupation, looked like bookcase daytime bedstead could. I object her constant solicitude; poor mother herself could loved better, studied make happy. Peggotty considered herself highly privileged allowed participate labours; and, although she still retained something her old sentiment awe reference aunt, received many marks encouragement confidence, best friends possible. But time come (I speaking Saturday I take tea Miss Mills’s) necessary her return home, enter discharge duties she undertaken behalf Ham. ‘So good-bye, Barkis,’ said aunt, ‘and take care yourself! I sure I never thought I could sorry lose you!’ I took Peggotty coach office saw her off. She cried parting, confided her brother friendship Ham done. We heard nothing since he went away, sunny afternoon. ‘And now, dear Davy,’ said Peggotty, ‘if, you are prentice, want money spend; if, you are time, dear, want set (and must one other, both, darling); good right ask leave lend you, sweet girl’s old stupid me!’ I savagely independent say anything reply, ever I borrowed money anyone, I would borrow her. Next accepting large sum spot, I believe gave Peggotty comfort anything I could done. ‘And, dear!’ whispered Peggotty, ‘tell pretty little angel I liked see her, minute! And tell her she marries boy, I will come make house beautiful you, you will let me!’ I declared nobody else touch it; gave Peggotty delight she went away good spirits. I fatigued much I possibly could Commons day, variety devices, appointed time evening repaired Mr. Mills’s street. Mr. Mills, terrible fellow fall asleep dinner, yet gone out, bird-cage middle window. He kept waiting long, I fervently hoped Club would fine late. At last he came out; I saw Dora hang bird-cage, peep balcony look me, run she saw I there, Jip remained behind, bark injuriously immense butcher’s dog street, could taken like pill. Dora came drawing-room door meet me; Jip came scrambling out, tumbling his growls, impression I Bandit; three went in, happy loving could be. I soon carried desolation bosom joys--not I meant it, I full subject--by asking Dora, without smallest preparation, she could love beggar? My pretty, little, startled Dora! Her association word yellow face nightcap, pair crutches, wooden leg, dog decanter-stand his mouth, something kind; she stared delightful wonder. ‘How ask anything foolish?’ pouted Dora. ‘Love beggar!’ ‘Dora, dearest!’ said I. ‘I beggar!’ ‘How silly thing,’ replied Dora, slapping hand, ‘as sit there, telling stories? I will make Jip bite you!’ Her childish way delicious way world me, necessary explicit, I solemnly repeated: ‘Dora, life, I ruined David!’ ‘I declare I will make Jip bite you!’ said Dora, shaking her curls, ‘if ridiculous.’ But I looked serious, Dora left shaking her curls, laid her trembling little hand upon shoulder, first looked scared anxious, began cry. That dreadful. I fell upon knees sofa, caressing her, imploring her rend heart; but, time, poor little Dora nothing exclaim Oh dear! Oh dear! And oh, she frightened! And Julia Mills! And oh, take her Julia Mills, go away, please! I almost beside myself. At last, agony supplication protestation, I got Dora look me, horrified expression face, I gradually soothed loving, her soft, pretty cheek lying mine. Then I told her, arms clasped round her, I loved her, dearly, dearly; I felt right offer release her her engagement, I poor; I never could bear it, recover it, I lost her; I fears poverty, she none, arm nerved heart inspired her; I already working courage none lovers knew; I begun practical, look future; crust well earned sweeter far feast inherited; much purpose, I delivered burst passionate eloquence quite surprising myself, though I thinking it, day night, ever since aunt astonished me. ‘Is heart mine still, dear Dora?’ said I, rapturously, I knew her clinging was. ‘Oh, yes!’ cried Dora. ‘Oh, yes, it is yours. Oh, do not dreadful!’ I dreadful! To Dora! ‘Do not talk poor, working hard!’ said Dora, nestling closer me. ‘Oh, do not, do not!’ ‘My dearest love,’ said I, ‘the crust well-earned--’ ‘Oh, yes; I do not want hear crusts!’ said Dora. ‘And Jip must mutton-chop every day twelve, he will die.’ I charmed her childish, winning way. I fondly explained Dora Jip his mutton-chop his accustomed regularity. I drew picture frugal home, made independent labour--sketching little house I seen Highgate, aunt her room upstairs. ‘I dreadful now, Dora?’ said I, tenderly. ‘Oh, no, no!’ cried Dora. ‘But I hope aunt keep her room good deal. And I hope she is scolding old thing!’ If possible love Dora ever, I sure I did. But I felt she little impracticable. It damped new-born ardour, find ardour difficult communication her. I made another trial. When she quite herself again, curling Jip’s ears, he lay upon her lap, I became grave, said: ‘My own! May I mention something?’ ‘Oh, please do not practical!’ said Dora, coaxingly. ‘Because frightens so!’ ‘Sweetheart!’ I returned; ‘there nothing alarm this. I want think quite differently. I want make nerve you, inspire you, Dora!’ ‘Oh, that is shocking!’ cried Dora. ‘My love, no. Perseverance strength character enable us bear much worse things.’ ‘But I have not got strength all,’ said Dora, shaking her curls. ‘Have I, Jip? Oh, kiss Jip, agreeable!’ It impossible resist kissing Jip, she held purpose, putting her bright, rosy little mouth kissing form, she directed operation, she insisted performed symmetrically, centre his nose. I she bade me--rewarding afterwards obedience--and she charmed graver character I do not know long. ‘But, Dora, beloved!’ said I, last resuming it; ‘I going mention something.’ The judge Prerogative Court might fallen love her, see her fold her little hands hold up, begging praying dreadful more. ‘Indeed I going be, darling!’ I assured her. ‘But, Dora, love, sometimes think,--not despondingly, know; far that!--but sometimes think--just encourage yourself--that engaged poor man--’ ‘Do not, do not! Pray do not!’ cried Dora. ‘It is dreadful!’ ‘My soul, all!’ said I, cheerfully. ‘If sometimes think that, look papa’s housekeeping, endeavour acquire little habit--of accounts, instance--’ Poor little Dora received suggestion something half sob half scream. ‘--It would useful us afterwards,’ I went on. ‘And would promise read little--a little Cookery Book I would send you, would excellent us. For path life, Dora,’ said I, warming subject, ‘is stony rugged now, rests us smooth it. We must fight way onward. We must brave. There obstacles met, must meet, crush them!’ I going great rate, clenched hand, enthusiastic countenance; quite unnecessary proceed. I said enough. I done again. Oh, she frightened! Oh, Julia Mills! Oh, take her Julia Mills, go away, please! So that, short, I quite distracted, raved drawing-room. I thought I killed her, time. I sprinkled water her face. I went knees. I plucked hair. I denounced remorseless brute ruthless beast. I implored her forgiveness. I besought her look up. I ravaged Miss Mills’s work-box smelling-bottle, agony mind applied ivory needle-case instead, dropped needles Dora. I shook fists Jip, frantic myself. I every wild extravagance could done, long way beyond end wits Miss Mills came room. ‘Who done this?’ exclaimed Miss Mills, succouring her friend. I replied, ‘I, Miss Mills! I done it! Behold destroyer!’--or words effect--and hid face light, sofa cushion. At first Miss Mills thought quarrel, verging Desert Sahara; she soon found matters stood, dear affectionate little Dora, embracing her, began exclaiming I ‘a poor labourer’; cried me, embraced me, asked would I let her give her money keep, fell Miss Mills’s neck, sobbing her tender heart broken. Miss Mills must born blessing us. She ascertained words about, comforted Dora, gradually convinced her I labourer--from manner stating case I believe Dora concluded I navigator, went balancing plank day wheelbarrow--and brought us together peace. When quite composed, Dora gone up-stairs put rose-water her eyes, Miss Mills rang tea. In ensuing interval, I told Miss Mills she evermore friend, heart must cease vibrate ere I could forget her sympathy. I expounded Miss Mills I endeavoured, unsuccessfully, expound Dora. Miss Mills replied, general principles, Cottage content better Palace cold splendour, love was, was. I said Miss Mills true, know better I, loved Dora love never mortal experienced yet? But Miss Mills observing, despondency, well indeed hearts so, I explained I begged leave restrict observation mortals masculine gender. I put Miss Mills, say whether she considered practical merit suggestion I anxious make, concerning accounts, housekeeping, Cookery Book? Miss Mills, consideration, thus replied: ‘Mr. Copperfield, I plain you. Mental suffering trial supply, natures, place years, I plain I Lady Abbess. No. The suggestion appropriate Dora. Our dearest Dora favourite child nature. She thing light, airiness, joy. I free confess could done, might well, but--’ And Miss Mills shook her head. I encouraged closing admission part Miss Mills ask her, whether, Dora’s sake, she opportunity luring her attention preparations earnest life, she would avail herself it? Miss Mills replied affirmative readily, I asked her she would take charge Cookery Book; and, she ever could insinuate upon Dora’s acceptance, without frightening her, undertake crowning service. Miss Mills accepted trust, too; sanguine. And Dora returned, looking lovely little creature, I really doubted whether she ought troubled anything ordinary. And she loved much, captivating (particularly she made Jip stand his hind legs toast, she pretended hold nose his hot teapot punishment he would not), I felt like sort Monster got Fairy’s bower, I thought frightened her, made her cry. After tea guitar; Dora sang dear old French songs impossibility ever account leaving dancing, La ra la, La ra la, I felt much greater Monster before. We one check pleasure, happened little I took leave, when, Miss Mills chancing make allusion tomorrow morning, I unluckily let that, obliged exert now, I got five of the clock. Whether Dora idea I Private Watchman, I unable say; made great impression her, she neither played sang more. It still her mind I bade her adieu; she said me, her pretty coaxing way--as I doll, I used think: ‘Now do not get five of the clock, naughty boy. It is nonsensical!’ ‘My love,’ said I, ‘I work do.’ ‘But do not it!’ returned Dora. ‘Why you?’ It impossible say sweet little surprised face, otherwise lightly playfully, must work live. ‘Oh! How ridiculous!’ cried Dora. ‘How shall live without, Dora?’ said I. ‘How? Any how!’ said Dora. She seemed think she quite settled question, gave triumphant little kiss, direct her innocent heart, I would hardly put her conceit her answer, fortune. Well! I loved her, I went loving her, absorbingly, entirely, completely. But going on, too, working pretty hard, busily keeping red-hot irons I fire, I would sit sometimes night, opposite aunt, thinking I frightened Dora time, I could best make way guitar-case forest difficulty, I used fancy head turning quite grey. CHAPTER 38. A DISSOLUTION OF PARTNERSHIP I allow resolution, respect Parliamentary Debates, cool. It one irons I began heat immediately, one irons I kept hot, hammered at, perseverance I may honestly admire. I bought approved scheme noble art mystery stenography (which cost ten sixpence); plunged sea perplexity brought me, weeks, confines distraction. The changes rung upon dots, position meant thing, another position something else, entirely different; wonderful vagaries played circles; unaccountable consequences resulted marks like flies’ legs; tremendous effects curve wrong place; troubled waking hours, reappeared sleep. When I groped way, blindly, difficulties, mastered alphabet, Egyptian Temple itself, appeared procession new horrors, called arbitrary characters; despotic characters I ever known; insisted, instance, thing like beginning cobweb, meant expectation, pen-and-ink sky-rocket, stood disadvantageous. When I fixed wretches mind, I found driven everything else it; then, beginning again, I forgot them; I picking up, I dropped fragments system; short, almost heart-breaking. It might quite heart-breaking, Dora, stay anchor tempest-driven bark. Every scratch scheme gnarled oak forest difficulty, I went cutting down, one another, vigour, three four months I condition make experiment one crack speakers Commons. Shall I ever forget crack speaker walked I began, left imbecile pencil staggering paper fit! This would do, quite clear. I flying high, never get on, so. I resorted Traddles advice; suggested he dictate speeches me, pace, occasional stoppages, adapted weakness. Very grateful friendly aid, I accepted proposal; night night, almost every night, long time, sort Private Parliament Buckingham Street, I came home Doctor’s. I like see Parliament anywhere else! My aunt Mr. Dick represented Government Opposition (as case might be), Traddles, assistance Enfield’s Speakers, volume parliamentary orations, thundered astonishing invectives them. Standing table, his finger page keep place, his right arm flourishing his head, Traddles, Mr. Pitt, Mr. Fox, Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Burke, Lord Castlereagh, Viscount Sidmouth, Mr. Canning, would work violent heats, deliver withering denunciations profligacy corruption aunt Mr. Dick; I used sit, little distance, notebook knee, fagging might main. The inconsistency recklessness Traddles exceeded real politician. He description policy, compass week; nailed sorts colours every denomination mast. My aunt, looking like immovable Chancellor Exchequer, would occasionally throw interruption two, ‘Hear!’ ‘No!’ ‘Oh!’ text seemed require it: always signal Mr. Dick (a perfect country gentleman) follow lustily cry. But Mr. Dick got taxed things course his Parliamentary career, made responsible awful consequences, he became uncomfortable his mind sometimes. I believe he actually began afraid he really something, tending annihilation British constitution, ruin country. Often often pursued debates clock pointed midnight, candles burning down. The result much good practice was, I began keep pace Traddles pretty well, quite triumphant I least idea notes about. But, reading I got them, I might well copied Chinese inscriptions immense collection tea-chests, golden characters great red green bottles chemists’ shops! There nothing it, turn back begin again. It hard, I turned back, though heavy heart, began laboriously methodically plod tedious ground snail’s pace; stopping examine minutely every speck way, sides, making desperate efforts know elusive characters sight wherever I met them. I always punctual office; Doctor’s too: I really work, common expression is, like cart-horse. One day, I went Commons usual, I found Mr. Spenlow doorway looking extremely grave, talking himself. As he habit complaining pains his head--he naturally short throat, I seriously believe he over-starched himself--I first alarmed idea he quite right direction; he soon relieved uneasiness. Instead returning ‘Good morning’ his usual affability, he looked distant, ceremonious manner, coldly requested accompany certain coffee-house, which, days, door opening Commons, within little archway St. Paul’s Churchyard. I complied, uncomfortable state, warm shooting me, apprehensions breaking buds. When I allowed go little before, account narrowness way, I observed he carried his head lofty air particularly unpromising; mind misgave he found darling Dora. If I guessed this, way coffee-house, I could hardly failed know matter I followed upstairs room, found Miss Murdstone there, supported background sideboard, several inverted tumblers sustaining lemons, two extraordinary boxes, corners flutings, sticking knives forks in, which, happily mankind, obsolete. Miss Murdstone gave her chilly finger-nails, sat severely rigid. Mr. Spenlow shut door, motioned chair, stood hearth-rug front fireplace. ‘Have goodness show Mr. Copperfield,’ said Mr. Spenlow, reticule, Miss Murdstone.’ I believe old identical steel-clasped reticule childhood, shut like bite. Compressing her lips, sympathy snap, Miss Murdstone opened it--opening her mouth little time--and produced last letter Dora, teeming expressions devoted affection. ‘I believe writing, Mr. Copperfield?’ said Mr. Spenlow. I hot, voice I heard unlike mine, I said, ‘It is, sir!’ ‘If I mistaken,’ said Mr. Spenlow, Miss Murdstone brought parcel letters her reticule, tied round dearest bit blue ribbon, ‘those also pen, Mr. Copperfield?’ I took her desolate sensation; and, glancing phrases top, ‘My ever dearest Dora,’ ‘My best beloved angel,’ ‘My blessed one ever,’ like, blushed deeply, inclined head. ‘No, thank you!’ said Mr. Spenlow, coldly, I mechanically offered back him. ‘I deprive them. Miss Murdstone, good proceed!’ That gentle creature, moment’s thoughtful survey carpet, delivered herself much dry unction follows. ‘I must confess entertained suspicions Miss Spenlow, reference David Copperfield, time. I observed Miss Spenlow David Copperfield, first met; impression made upon agreeable. The depravity human heart such--’ ‘You oblige me, madam,’ interrupted Mr. Spenlow, ‘by confining facts.’ Miss Murdstone cast her eyes, shook her head protesting unseemly interruption, frowning dignity resumed: ‘Since I confine facts, I state dryly I can. Perhaps considered acceptable course proceeding. I already said, sir, I suspicions Miss Spenlow, reference David Copperfield, time. I frequently endeavoured find decisive corroboration suspicions, without effect. I therefore forborne mention Miss Spenlow’s father’; looking severely him--‘knowing little disposition usually cases, acknowledge conscientious discharge duty.’ Mr. Spenlow seemed quite cowed gentlemanly sternness Miss Murdstone’s manner, deprecated her severity conciliatory little wave his hand. ‘On return Norwood, period absence occasioned brother’s marriage,’ pursued Miss Murdstone disdainful voice, ‘and return Miss Spenlow her visit her friend Miss Mills, I imagined manner Miss Spenlow gave greater occasion suspicion before. Therefore I watched Miss Spenlow closely.’ Dear, tender little Dora, unconscious Dragon’s eye! ‘Still,’ resumed Miss Murdstone, ‘I found proof last night. It appeared Miss Spenlow received many letters her friend Miss Mills; Miss Mills her friend her father’s full concurrence,’ another telling blow Mr. Spenlow, ‘it interfere. If I may permitted allude natural depravity human heart, least I may--I must--be permitted, far refer misplaced confidence.’ Mr. Spenlow apologetically murmured his assent. ‘Last evening tea,’ pursued Miss Murdstone, ‘I observed little dog starting, rolling, growling drawing-room, worrying something. I said Miss Spenlow, “Dora, dog his mouth? It is paper.” Miss Spenlow immediately put her hand her frock, gave sudden cry, ran dog. I interposed, said, “Dora, love, must permit me.”’ Oh Jip, miserable Spaniel, wretchedness, then, work! ‘Miss Spenlow endeavoured,’ said Miss Murdstone, ‘to bribe kisses, work-boxes, small articles jewellery--that, course, I pass over. The little dog retreated sofa approaching him, great difficulty dislodged fire-irons. Even dislodged, he still kept letter his mouth; endeavouring take him, imminent risk bitten, he kept his teeth pertinaciously suffer held suspended air means document. At length I obtained possession it. After perusing it, I taxed Miss Spenlow many letters her possession; ultimately obtained her packet David Copperfield’s hand.’ Here she ceased; snapping her reticule again, shutting her mouth, looked she might broken, could never bent. ‘You heard Miss Murdstone,’ said Mr. Spenlow, turning me. ‘I beg ask, Mr. Copperfield, anything say reply?’ The picture I me, beautiful little treasure heart, sobbing crying night--of her alone, frightened, wretched, then--of her piteously begged prayed stony-hearted woman forgive her--of her vainly offered her kisses, work-boxes, trinkets--of her grievous distress, me--very much impaired little dignity I able muster. I afraid I tremulous state minute so, though I best disguise it. ‘There nothing I say, sir,’ I returned, ‘except blame mine. Dora--’ ‘Miss Spenlow, please,’ said her father, majestically. ‘--was induced persuaded me,’ I went on, swallowing colder designation, ‘to consent concealment, I bitterly regret it.’ ‘You much blame, sir,’ said Mr. Spenlow, walking fro upon hearth-rug, emphasizing he said his whole body instead his head, account stiffness his cravat spine. ‘You done stealthy unbecoming action, Mr. Copperfield. When I take gentleman house, matter whether he nineteen, twenty-nine, ninety, I take spirit confidence. If he abuses confidence, he commits dishonourable action, Mr. Copperfield.’ ‘I feel it, sir, I assure you,’ I returned. ‘But I never thought so, before. Sincerely, honestly, indeed, Mr. Spenlow, I never thought so, before. I love Miss Spenlow extent--’ ‘Pooh! nonsense!’ said Mr. Spenlow, reddening. ‘Pray do not tell face love daughter, Mr. Copperfield!’ ‘Could I defend conduct I not, sir?’ I returned, humility. ‘Can defend conduct do, sir?’ said Mr. Spenlow, stopping short upon hearth-rug. ‘Have considered years, daughter’s years, Mr. Copperfield? Have considered undermine confidence subsist daughter myself? Have considered daughter’s station life, projects I may contemplate her advancement, testamentary intentions I may reference her? Have considered anything, Mr. Copperfield?’ ‘Very little, sir, I afraid;’ I answered, speaking respectfully sorrowfully I felt; ‘but pray believe me, I considered worldly position. When I explained you, already engaged--’ ‘I BEG,’ said Mr. Spenlow, like Punch I ever seen him, he energetically struck one hand upon other--I could help noticing even despair; ‘that YOU Will NOT talk engagements, Mr. Copperfield!’ The otherwise immovable Miss Murdstone laughed contemptuously one short syllable. ‘When I explained altered position you, sir,’ I began again, substituting new form expression unpalatable him, ‘this concealment, I unhappy led Miss Spenlow, begun. Since I altered position, I strained every nerve, I exerted every energy, improve it. I sure I shall improve time. Will grant time--any length time? We young, sir,--’ ‘You right,’ interrupted Mr. Spenlow, nodding his head great many times, frowning much, ‘you young. It is nonsense. Let end nonsense. Take away letters, throw fire. Give Miss Spenlow’s letters throw fire; although future intercourse must, aware, restricted Commons here, agree make mention past. Come, Mr. Copperfield, do not want sense; sensible course.’ No. I could not think agreeing it. I sorry, higher consideration sense. Love earthly considerations, I loved Dora idolatry, Dora loved me. I did not exactly say so; I softened much I could; I implied it, I resolute upon it. I do not think I made ridiculous, I know I resolute. ‘Very well, Mr. Copperfield,’ said Mr. Spenlow, ‘I must try influence daughter.’ Miss Murdstone, expressive sound, long drawn respiration, neither sigh moan, like both, gave her opinion he done first. ‘I must try,’ said Mr. Spenlow, confirmed support, ‘my influence daughter. Do decline take letters, Mr. Copperfield?’ For I laid table. Yes. I told I hoped he would think wrong, I could not possibly take Miss Murdstone. ‘Nor me?’ said Mr. Spenlow. No, I replied profoundest respect; him. ‘Very well!’ said Mr. Spenlow. A silence succeeding, I undecided whether go stay. At length I moving quietly towards door, intention saying perhaps I consult his feelings best withdrawing: he said, his hands his coat pockets, much he could get them; I call, upon whole, decidedly pious air: ‘You probably aware, Mr. Copperfield, I altogether destitute worldly possessions, daughter nearest dearest relative?’ I hurriedly made reply effect, I hoped error I betrayed desperate nature love, induce think mercenary too? ‘I do not allude matter light,’ said Mr. Spenlow. ‘It would better yourself, us, WERE mercenary, Mr. Copperfield--I mean, discreet less influenced youthful nonsense. No. I merely say, quite another view, probably aware I property bequeath child?’ I certainly supposed so. ‘And hardly think,’ said Mr. Spenlow, ‘having experience see, Commons here, every day, various unaccountable negligent proceedings men, respect testamentary arrangements--of subjects, one perhaps strangest revelations human inconsistency met with--but mine made?’ I inclined head acquiescence. ‘I allow,’ said Mr. Spenlow, evident increase pious sentiment, slowly shaking his head he poised upon his toes heels alternately, ‘my suitable provision child influenced piece youthful folly like present. It mere folly. Mere nonsense. In little while, weigh lighter feather. But I might--I might--if silly business completely relinquished altogether, induced anxious moment guard her from, surround her protections against, consequences foolish step way marriage. Now, Mr. Copperfield, I hope render necessary open, even quarter hour, closed page book life, unsettle, even quarter hour, grave affairs long since composed.’ There serenity, tranquillity, calm sunset air him, quite affected me. He peaceful resigned--clearly his affairs perfect train, systematically wound up--that he man feel touched contemplation of. I really think I saw tears rise his eyes, depth his feeling this. But could I do? I could deny Dora heart. When he told I better take week consider he said, could I say I would not take week, yet could I fail know amount weeks could influence love mine? ‘In meantime, confer Miss Trotwood, person knowledge life,’ said Mr. Spenlow, adjusting his cravat hands. ‘Take week, Mr. Copperfield.’ I submitted; and, countenance expressive I able make dejected despairing constancy, came room. Miss Murdstone’s heavy eyebrows followed door--I say her eyebrows rather her eyes, much important her face--and she looked exactly she used look, hour morning, parlour Blunderstone, I could fancied I breaking lessons again, dead weight mind horrible old spelling-book, oval woodcuts, shaped, youthful fancy, like glasses spectacles. When I got office, and, shutting old Tiffey rest hands, sat desk, particular nook, thinking earthquake taken place unexpectedly, bitterness spirit cursing Jip, I fell state torment Dora, I wonder I take hat rush insanely Norwood. The idea frightening her, making her cry, comfort her, excruciating, impelled write wild letter Mr. Spenlow, beseeching visit upon her consequences awful destiny. I implored spare her gentle nature--not crush fragile flower--and addressed generally, best remembrance, if, instead her father, he Ogre, Dragon Wantley. This letter I sealed laid upon his desk he returned; he came in, I saw him, half-opened door his room, take read it. He said nothing morning; he went away afternoon he called in, told I need make uneasy his daughter’s happiness. He assured her, he said, nonsense; he nothing say her. He believed he indulgent father (as indeed he was), I might spare solicitude her account. ‘You may make necessary, foolish obstinate, Mr. Copperfield,’ he observed, ‘for send daughter abroad again, term; I better opinion you. I hope wiser that, days. As Miss Murdstone,’ I alluded her letter, ‘I respect lady’s vigilance, feel obliged her; she strict charge avoid subject. All I desire, Mr. Copperfield, is, forgotten. All got do, Mr. Copperfield, forget it.’ All! In note I wrote Miss Mills, I bitterly quoted sentiment. All I do, I said, gloomy sarcasm, forget Dora. That all, that! I entreated Miss Mills see me, evening. If could done Mr. Mills’s sanction concurrence, I besought clandestine interview back kitchen Mangle was. I informed her reason tottering throne, she, Miss Mills, could prevent deposed. I signed myself, distractedly; I could not help feeling, I read composition over, sending porter, something style Mr. Micawber. However, I sent it. At night I repaired Miss Mills’s street, walked down, I stealthily fetched Miss Mills’s maid, taken area way back kitchen. I since seen reason believe nothing earth prevent going front door, shown drawing-room, except Miss Mills’s love romantic mysterious. In back kitchen, I raved became me. I went there, I suppose, make fool myself, I quite sure I it. Miss Mills received hasty note Dora, telling her discovered, saying. ‘Oh pray come me, Julia, do, do!’ But Miss Mills, mistrusting acceptability her presence higher powers, yet gone; benighted Desert Sahara. Miss Mills wonderful flow words, liked pour out. I could help feeling, though she mingled her tears mine, she dreadful luxury afflictions. She petted them, I may say, made them. A deep gulf, she observed, opened Dora me, Love could span rainbow. Love must suffer stern world; ever so, ever would so. No matter, Miss Mills remarked. Hearts confined cobwebs would burst last, Love avenged. This small consolation, Miss Mills would not encourage fallacious hopes. She made much wretched I before, I felt (and told her deepest gratitude) she indeed friend. We resolved she go Dora first thing morning, find means assuring her, either looks words, devotion misery. We parted, overwhelmed grief; I think Miss Mills enjoyed herself completely. I confided aunt I got home; spite she could say me, went bed despairing. I got despairing, went despairing. It Saturday morning, I went straight Commons. I surprised, I came within sight office-door, see ticket-porters standing outside talking together, half-dozen stragglers gazing windows shut up. I quickened pace, and, passing among them, wondering looks, went hurriedly in. The clerks there, nobody anything. Old Tiffey, first time his life I think, sitting somebody else’s stool, hung his hat. ‘This dreadful calamity, Mr. Copperfield,’ said he, I entered. ‘What is?’ I exclaimed. ‘What is matter?’ ‘Do not know?’ cried Tiffey, rest them, coming round me. ‘No!’ said I, looking face face. ‘Mr. Spenlow,’ said Tiffey. ‘What him!’ ‘Dead!’ I thought office reeling, I, one clerks caught hold me. They sat chair, untied neck-cloth, brought water. I idea whether took time. ‘Dead?’ said I. ‘He dined town yesterday, drove phaeton himself,’ said Tiffey, ‘having sent his groom home coach, he sometimes did, know--’ ‘Well?’ ‘The phaeton went home without him. The horses stopped stable-gate. The man went lantern. Nobody carriage.’ ‘Had run away?’ ‘They hot,’ said Tiffey, putting his glasses; ‘no hotter, I understand, would been, going usual pace. The reins broken, dragging ground. The house roused directly, three went along road. They found mile off.’ ‘More mile off, Mr. Tiffey,’ interposed junior. ‘Was it? I believe right,’ said Tiffey,--‘more mile off--not far church--lying partly roadside, partly path, upon his face. Whether he fell fit, got out, feeling ill fit came on--or even whether he quite dead then, though doubt he quite insensible--no one appears know. If he breathed, certainly he never spoke. Medical assistance got soon possible, quite useless.’ I cannot describe state mind I thrown intelligence. The shock event happening suddenly, happening one I respect variance--the appalling vacancy room he occupied lately, his chair table seemed wait him, his handwriting yesterday like ghost--the indefinable impossibility separating place, feeling, door opened, he might come in--the lazy hush rest office, insatiable relish people talked it, people came day, gorged subject--this easily intelligible anyone. What I cannot describe is, how, innermost recesses heart, I lurking jealousy even Death. How I felt might would push ground Dora’s thoughts. How I was, grudging way I words for, envious her grief. How made restless think her weeping others, consoled others. How I grasping, avaricious wish shut everybody her myself, her, unseasonable time times. In trouble state mind--not exclusively own, I hope, known others--I went Norwood night; finding one servants, I made inquiries door, Miss Mills there, got aunt direct letter her, I wrote. I deplored untimely death Mr. Spenlow, sincerely, she would tears so. I entreated her tell Dora, Dora state hear it, he spoken utmost kindness consideration; coupled nothing tenderness, single reproachful word, her name. I know I selfishly, name brought her; I tried believe act justice his memory. Perhaps I believe it. My aunt received lines next day reply; addressed, outside, her; within, me. Dora overcome grief; her friend asked her she send her love me, cried, she always crying, ‘Oh, dear papa! oh, poor papa!’ But she said No, I made of. Mr. Jorkins, Norwood since occurrence, came office days afterwards. He Tiffey closeted together moments, Tiffey looked door beckoned in. ‘Oh!’ said Mr. Jorkins. ‘Mr. Tiffey myself, Mr. Copperfield, examine desks, drawers, repositories deceased, view sealing his private papers, searching Will. There trace any, elsewhere. It may well assist us, please.’ I agony obtain knowledge circumstances Dora would placed--as, whose guardianship, forth--and something towards it. We began search once; Mr. Jorkins unlocking drawers desks, taking papers. The office-papers placed one side, private papers (which numerous) other. We grave; came stray seal, pencil-case, ring, little article kind associated personally him, spoke low. We sealed several packets; still going dustily quietly, Mr. Jorkins said us, applying exactly words his late partner his late partner applied him: ‘Mr. Spenlow difficult move beaten track. You know he was! I disposed think he made will.’ ‘Oh, I know he had!’ said I. They stopped looked me. ‘On day I last saw him,’ said I, ‘he told he had, his affairs long since settled.’ Mr. Jorkins old Tiffey shook heads one accord. ‘That looks unpromising,’ said Tiffey. ‘Very unpromising,’ said Mr. Jorkins. ‘Surely do not doubt--’ I began. ‘My good Mr. Copperfield!’ said Tiffey, laying his hand upon arm, shutting his eyes he shook his head: ‘if Commons long I have, would know subject men inconsistent, little trusted.’ ‘Why, bless soul, he made remark!’ I replied persistently. ‘I call almost final,’ observed Tiffey. ‘My opinion is--no will.’ It appeared wonderful thing me, turned will. He never much thought making one, far his papers afforded evidence; kind hint, sketch, memorandum, testamentary intention whatever. What scarcely less astonishing me, was, his affairs disordered state. It extremely difficult, I heard, make he owed, he paid, he died possessed. It considered likely years he could clear opinion subjects himself. By little little came out, that, competition points appearance gentility running high Commons, he spent his professional income, large one, reduced his private means, ever great (which exceedingly doubtful), low ebb indeed. There sale furniture lease, Norwood; Tiffey told me, little thinking interested I story, that, paying debts deceased, deducting his share outstanding bad doubtful debts due firm, he would not give thousand pounds assets remaining. This expiration six weeks. I suffered tortures time; thought I really must laid violent hands upon myself, Miss Mills still reported me, broken-hearted little Dora would say nothing, I mentioned, ‘Oh, poor papa! Oh, dear papa!’ Also, she relations two aunts, maiden sisters Mr. Spenlow, lived Putney, held chance communication brother many years. Not ever quarrelled (Miss Mills informed me); been, occasion Dora’s christening, invited tea, considered privileged invited dinner, expressed opinion writing, ‘better happiness parties’ stay away. Since gone road, brother gone his. These two ladies emerged retirement, proposed take Dora live Putney. Dora, clinging both, weeping, exclaimed, ‘O yes, aunts! Please take Julia Mills Jip Putney!’ So went, soon funeral. How I found time haunt Putney, I sure I do not know; I contrived, means other, prowl neighbourhood pretty often. Miss Mills, exact discharge duties friendship, kept journal; she used meet sometimes, Common, read it, (if she time that) lend me. How I treasured entries, I subjoin sample--! ‘Monday.

To see her, seen Dora little before--to trace initial letter Dora’s name her sympathetic pages--to made miserable her--were comforts. I felt I living palace cards, tumbled down, leaving Miss Mills among ruins; I felt grim enchanter drawn magic circle round innocent goddess heart, nothing indeed strong pinions, capable carrying many people much, would enable enter! CHAPTER 39. WICKFIELD AND HEEP My aunt, beginning, I imagine, made seriously uncomfortable prolonged dejection, made pretence anxious I go Dover, see working well cottage, let; conclude agreement, tenant, longer term occupation. Janet drafted service Mrs. Strong, I saw her every day. She undecided, leaving Dover, whether give finishing touch renunciation mankind she educated, marrying pilot; she decided venture. Not much sake principle, I believe, she happened like him. Although required effort leave Miss Mills, I fell rather willingly aunt’s pretence, means enabling pass tranquil hours Agnes. I consulted good Doctor relative absence three days; Doctor wishing take relaxation,--he wished take more; energy could bear that,--I made mind go. As Commons, I great occasion particular duties quarter. To say truth, getting good odour among tip-top proctors, rapidly sliding doubtful position. The business indifferent Mr. Jorkins, Mr. Spenlow’s time; although quickened infusion new blood, display Mr. Spenlow made, still established sufficiently strong basis bear, without shaken, blow sudden loss active manager. It fell much. Mr. Jorkins, notwithstanding his reputation firm, easy-going, incapable sort man, whose reputation doors calculated back up. I turned now, I saw take his snuff let business go, I regretted aunt’s thousand pounds ever. But worst it. There number hangers-on outsiders Commons, who, without proctors themselves, dabbled common-form business, got done real proctors, lent names consideration share spoil;--and good many too. As house wanted business terms, joined noble band; threw lures hangers-on outsiders, bring business us. Marriage licences small probates looked for, paid us best; competition ran high indeed. Kidnappers inveiglers planted avenues entrance Commons, instructions utmost cut persons mourning, gentlemen anything bashful appearance, entice offices respective employers interested; instructions well observed, I myself, I known sight, twice hustled premises principal opponent. The conflicting interests touting gentlemen nature irritate feelings, personal collisions took place; Commons even scandalized principal inveigler (who formerly wine trade, afterwards sworn brokery line) walking days black eye. Any one scouts used think nothing politely assisting old lady black vehicle, killing proctor she inquired for, representing his employer lawful successor representative proctor, bearing old lady (sometimes greatly affected) his employer’s office. Many captives brought way. As marriage licences, competition rose pitch, shy gentleman want one, nothing submit first inveigler, fought for, become prey strongest. One clerks, outsider, used, height contest, sit his hat on, he might ready rush swear surrogate victim brought in. The system inveigling continues, I believe, day. The last time I Commons, civil able-bodied person white apron pounced upon doorway, whispering word ‘Marriage-licence’ ear, great difficulty prevented taking his arms lifting proctor’s. From digression, let proceed Dover. I found everything satisfactory state cottage; enabled gratify aunt exceedingly reporting tenant inherited her feud, waged incessant war donkeys. Having settled little business I transact there, slept one night, I walked Canterbury early morning. It winter again; fresh, cold windy day, sweeping downland, brightened hopes little. Coming Canterbury, I loitered old streets sober pleasure calmed spirits, eased heart. There old signs, old names shops, old people serving them. It appeared long, since I schoolboy there, I wondered place little changed, I reflected little I changed myself. Strange say, quiet influence inseparable mind Agnes, seemed pervade even city she dwelt. The venerable cathedral towers, old jackdaws rooks whose airy voices made retired perfect silence would done; battered gateways, one stuck full statues, long thrown down, crumbled away, like reverential pilgrims gazed upon them; still nooks, ivied growth centuries crept gabled ends ruined walls; ancient houses, pastoral landscape field, orchard, garden; everywhere--on everything--I felt serener air, calm, thoughtful, softening spirit. Arrived Mr. Wickfield’s house, I found, little lower room ground floor, Uriah Heep old accustomed sit, Mr. Micawber plying his pen great assiduity. He dressed legal-looking suit black, loomed, burly large, small office. Mr. Micawber extremely glad see me, little confused too. He would conducted immediately presence Uriah, I declined. ‘I know house old, recollect,’ said I, ‘and find way upstairs. How like law, Mr. Micawber?’ ‘My dear Copperfield,’ he replied. ‘To man possessed higher imaginative powers, objection legal studies amount detail involve. Even professional correspondence,’ said Mr. Micawber, glancing letters he writing, ‘the mind liberty soar exalted form expression. Still, great pursuit. A great pursuit!’ He told he become tenant Uriah Heep’s old house; Mrs. Micawber would delighted receive me, more, her roof. ‘It humble,’ said Mr. Micawber, ‘--to quote favourite expression friend Heep; may prove stepping-stone ambitious domiciliary accommodation.’ I asked whether he reason, far, satisfied his friend Heep’s treatment him? He got ascertain door close shut, he replied, lower voice: ‘My dear Copperfield, man labours pressure pecuniary embarrassments, is, generality people, disadvantage. That disadvantage diminished, pressure necessitates drawing stipendiary emoluments, emoluments strictly due payable. All I say is, friend Heep responded appeals I need particularly refer, manner calculated redound equally honour his head, his heart.’ ‘I supposed free his money either,’ I observed. ‘Pardon me!’ said Mr. Micawber, air constraint, ‘I speak friend Heep I experience.’ ‘I glad experience favourable,’ I returned. ‘You obliging, dear Copperfield,’ said Mr. Micawber; hummed tune. ‘Do see much Mr. Wickfield?’ I asked, change subject. ‘Not much,’ said Mr. Micawber, slightingly. ‘Mr. Wickfield is, I dare say, man excellent intentions; he is--in short, he obsolete.’ ‘I afraid his partner seeks make so,’ said I. ‘My dear Copperfield!’ returned Mr. Micawber, uneasy evolutions his stool, ‘allow offer remark! I here, capacity confidence. I here, position trust. The discussion topics, even Mrs. Micawber herself (so long partner various vicissitudes, woman remarkable lucidity intellect), is, I led consider, incompatible functions devolving me. I would therefore take liberty suggesting friendly intercourse--which I trust never disturbed!--we draw line. On one side line,’ said Mr. Micawber, representing desk office ruler, ‘is whole range human intellect, trifling exception; other, IS exception; say, affairs Messrs Wickfield Heep, belonging appertaining thereunto. I trust I give offence companion youth, submitting proposition his cooler judgement?’ Though I saw uneasy change Mr. Micawber, sat tightly him, his new duties misfit, I felt I right offended. My telling so, appeared relieve him; he shook hands me. ‘I charmed, Copperfield,’ said Mr. Micawber, ‘let assure you, Miss Wickfield. She superior young lady, remarkable attractions, graces, virtues. Upon honour,’ said Mr. Micawber, indefinitely kissing his hand bowing his genteelest air, ‘I Homage Miss Wickfield! Hem!’ ‘I glad that, least,’ said I. ‘If assured us, dear Copperfield, occasion agreeable afternoon happiness passing you, D. favourite letter,’ said Mr. Micawber, ‘I unquestionably supposed A. so.’ We experience feeling, comes us occasionally, saying said done before, remote time--of surrounded, dim ages ago, faces, objects, circumstances--of knowing perfectly said next, suddenly remembered it! I never mysterious impression strongly life, he uttered words. I took leave Mr. Micawber, time, charging best remembrances home. As I left him, resuming his stool his pen, rolling his head his stock, get easier writing order, I clearly perceived something interposed me, since he come his new functions, prevented getting used do, quite altered character intercourse. There one quaint old drawing-room, though presented tokens Mrs. Heep’s whereabouts. I looked room still belonging Agnes, saw her sitting fire, pretty old-fashioned desk she had, writing. My darkening light made her look up. What pleasure bright change her attentive face, object sweet regard welcome! ‘Ah, Agnes!’ said I, sitting together, side side; ‘I missed much, lately!’ ‘Indeed?’ she replied. ‘Again! And soon?’ I shook head. ‘I do not know is, Agnes; I seem want faculty mind I ought have. You much habit thinking me, happy old days here, I came naturally counsel support, I really think I missed acquiring it.’ ‘And it?’ said Agnes, cheerfully. ‘I do not know call it,’ I replied. ‘I think I earnest persevering?’ ‘I sure it,’ said Agnes. ‘And patient, Agnes?’ I inquired, little hesitation. ‘Yes,’ returned Agnes, laughing. ‘Pretty well.’ ‘And yet,’ said I, ‘I get miserable worried, unsteady irresolute power assuring myself, I know I must want--shall I call it--reliance, kind?’ ‘Call so, will,’ said Agnes. ‘Well!’ I returned. ‘See here! You come London, I rely you, I object course once. I driven it, I come here, moment I feel altered person. The circumstances distressed changed, since I came room; influence comes short interval alters me, oh, much better! What it? What secret, Agnes?’ Her head bent down, looking fire. ‘It is old story,’ said I. ‘Do not laugh, I say always little things greater ones. My old troubles nonsense, serious; whenever I gone away adopted sister--’ Agnes looked up--with Heavenly face!--and gave her hand, I kissed. ‘Whenever I you, Agnes, advise approve beginning, I seemed go wild, get sorts difficulty. When I come you, last (as I always done), I come peace happiness. I come home, now, like tired traveller, find blessed sense rest!’ I felt deeply I said, affected sincerely, voice failed, I covered face hand, broke tears. I write truth. Whatever contradictions inconsistencies within me, within many us; whatever might different, much better; whatever I done, I perversely wandered away voice heart; I knew nothing of. I knew I fervently earnest, I felt rest peace Agnes near me. In her placid sisterly manner; her beaming eyes; her tender voice; sweet composure, long ago made house held her quite sacred place me; she soon weakness, led tell happened since last meeting. ‘And another word tell, Agnes,’ said I, I made end confidence. ‘Now, reliance you.’ ‘But must me, Trotwood,’ returned Agnes, pleasant smile. ‘It must someone else.’ ‘On Dora?’ said I. ‘Assuredly.’ ‘Why, I mentioned, Agnes,’ said I, little embarrassed, ‘that Dora rather difficult to--I would not, world, say, rely upon, she soul purity truth--but rather difficult to--I hardly know express it, really, Agnes. She timid little thing, easily disturbed frightened. Some time ago, her father’s death, I thought right mention her--but I will tell you, bear me, was.’ Accordingly, I told Agnes declaration poverty, cookery-book, housekeeping accounts, rest it. ‘Oh, Trotwood!’ she remonstrated, smile. ‘Just old headlong way! You might earnest striving get world, without sudden timid, loving, inexperienced girl. Poor Dora!’ I never heard sweet forbearing kindness expressed voice, she expressed making reply. It I seen her admiringly tenderly embracing Dora, tacitly reproving me, her considerate protection, hot haste fluttering little heart. It I seen Dora, her fascinating artlessness, caressing Agnes, thanking her, coaxingly appealing me, loving her childish innocence. I felt grateful Agnes, admired her so! I saw two together, bright perspective, well-associated friends, adorning much! ‘What ought I then, Agnes?’ I inquired, looking fire little while. ‘What would right do?’ ‘I think,’ said Agnes, ‘that honourable course take, would write two ladies. Do not think secret course unworthy one?’ ‘Yes. If YOU think so,’ said I. ‘I poorly qualified judge matters,’ replied Agnes, modest hesitation, ‘but I certainly feel--in short, I feel secret clandestine, like yourself.’ ‘Like myself, high opinion me, Agnes, I afraid,’ said I. ‘Like yourself, candour nature,’ she returned; ‘and therefore I would write two ladies. I would relate, plainly openly possible, taken place; I would ask permission visit sometimes, house. Considering young, striving place life, I think would well say would readily abide conditions might impose upon you. I would entreat dismiss request, without reference Dora; discuss her think time suitable. I would vehement,’ said Agnes, gently, ‘or propose much. I would trust fidelity perseverance--and Dora.’ ‘But frighten Dora again, Agnes, speaking her,’ said I. ‘And Dora cry, say nothing me!’ ‘Is likely?’ inquired Agnes, sweet consideration her face. ‘God bless her, she easily scared bird,’ said I. ‘It might be! Or two Miss Spenlows (elderly ladies sort odd characters sometimes) likely persons address way!’ ‘I do not think, Trotwood,’ returned Agnes, raising her soft eyes mine, ‘I would consider that. Perhaps would better consider whether right this; and, is, it.’ I longer doubt subject. With lightened heart, though profound sense weighty importance task, I devoted whole afternoon composition draft letter; great purpose, Agnes relinquished her desk me. But first I went downstairs see Mr. Wickfield Uriah Heep. I found Uriah possession new, plaster-smelling office, built garden; looking extraordinarily mean, midst quantity books papers. He received his usual fawning way, pretended heard arrival Mr. Micawber; pretence I took liberty disbelieving. He accompanied Mr. Wickfield’s room, shadow former self--having divested variety conveniences, accommodation new partner--and stood fire, warming his back, shaving his chin his bony hand, Mr. Wickfield I exchanged greetings. ‘You stay us, Trotwood, remain Canterbury?’ said Mr. Wickfield, without glance Uriah his approval. ‘Is room me?’ said I. ‘I sure, Master Copperfield--I say Mister, comes natural,’ said Uriah,--‘I would turn old room pleasure, would agreeable.’ ‘No, no,’ said Mr. Wickfield. ‘Why inconvenienced? There is another room. There is another room.’ ‘Oh, know,’ returned Uriah, grin, ‘I really delighted!’ To cut matter short, I said I would room none all; settled I room; and, taking leave firm dinner, I went upstairs again. I hoped companion Agnes. But Mrs. Heep asked permission bring herself her knitting near fire, room; pretence aspect favourable her rheumatics, wind was, drawing-room dining-parlour. Though I could almost consigned her mercies wind topmost pinnacle Cathedral, without remorse, I made virtue necessity, gave her friendly salutation. ‘I am umbly thankful you, sir,’ said Mrs. Heep, acknowledgement inquiries concerning her health, ‘but I am pretty well. I have not much boast of. If I could see Uriah well settled life, I could not expect much I think. How think Ury looking, sir?’ I thought looking villainous ever, I replied I saw change him. ‘Oh, do not think he is changed?’ said Mrs. Heep. ‘There I must umbly beg leave differ you. Do not see thinness him?’ ‘Not usual,’ I replied. ‘Do not though!’ said Mrs. Heep. ‘But do not take notice mother’s eye!’ His mother’s eye evil eye rest world, I thought met mine, howsoever affectionate him; I believe she her son devoted one another. It passed me, went Agnes. ‘Do not YOU see wasting wearing him, Miss Wickfield?’ inquired Mrs. Heep. ‘No,’ said Agnes, quietly pursuing work she engaged. ‘You solicitous him. He well.’ Mrs. Heep, prodigious sniff, resumed her knitting. She never left off, left us moment. I arrived early day, still three four hours dinner; she sat there, plying her knitting-needles monotonously hour-glass might poured sands. She sat one side fire; I sat desk front it; little beyond me, side, sat Agnes. Whensoever, slowly pondering letter, I lifted eyes, meeting thoughtful face Agnes, saw clear, beam encouragement upon me, angelic expression, I conscious presently evil eye passing me, going her, coming back again, dropping furtively upon knitting. What knitting was, I do not know, learned art; looked like net; she worked away Chinese chopsticks knitting-needles, she showed firelight like ill-looking enchantress, baulked yet radiant goodness opposite, getting ready cast her net by. At dinner she maintained her watch, unwinking eyes. After dinner, her son took his turn; Mr. Wickfield, himself, I left alone together, leered me, writhed I could hardly bear it. In drawing-room, mother knitting watching again. All time Agnes sang played, mother sat piano. Once she asked particular ballad, she said her Ury (who yawning great chair) doted on; intervals she looked round him, reported Agnes he raptures music. But she hardly ever spoke--I question she ever did--without making mention him. It evident duty assigned her. This lasted bedtime. To seen mother son, like two great bats hanging whole house, darkening ugly forms, made uncomfortable, I would rather remained downstairs, knitting all, gone bed. I hardly got sleep. Next day knitting watching began again, lasted day. I opportunity speaking Agnes, ten minutes. I could barely show her letter. I proposed her walk me; Mrs. Heep repeatedly complaining she worse, Agnes charitably remained within, bear her company. Towards twilight I went myself, musing I ought do, whether I justified withholding Agnes, longer, Uriah Heep told London; began trouble again, much. I walked far enough quite clear town, upon Ramsgate road, good path, I hailed, dust, somebody behind me. The shambling figure, scanty great-coat, mistaken. I stopped, Uriah Heep came up. ‘Well?’ said I. ‘How fast walk!’ said he. ‘My legs pretty long, you have given ‘them quite job.’ ‘Where going?’ said I. ‘I going you, Master Copperfield, you will allow pleasure walk old acquaintance.’ Saying this, jerk his body, might either propitiatory derisive, he fell step beside me. ‘Uriah!’ said I, civilly I could, silence. ‘Master Copperfield!’ said Uriah. ‘To tell truth (at offended), I came Out walk alone, I much company.’ He looked sideways, said his hardest grin, ‘You mean mother.’ ‘Why yes, I do,’ said I. ‘Ah! But know we are umble,’ he returned. ‘And knowledge umbleness, must really take care we are pushed wall is not umble. All stratagems fair love, sir.’ Raising his great hands touched his chin, he rubbed softly, softly chuckled; looking like malevolent baboon, I thought, anything human could look. ‘You see,’ he said, still hugging unpleasant way, shaking his head me, ‘you are quite dangerous rival, Master Copperfield. You always was, know.’ ‘Do set watch upon Miss Wickfield, make her home home, me?’ said I. ‘Oh! Master Copperfield! Those arsh words,’ he replied. ‘Put meaning words like,’ said I. ‘You know is, Uriah, well I do.’ ‘Oh no! You must put words,’ he said. ‘Oh, really! I could not myself.’ ‘Do suppose,’ said I, constraining temperate quiet him, account Agnes, ‘that I regard Miss Wickfield otherwise dear sister?’ ‘Well, Master Copperfield,’ he replied, ‘you perceive I bound answer question. You may not, know. But then, see, may!’ Anything equal low cunning his visage, his shadowless eyes without ghost eyelash, I never saw. ‘Come then!’ said I. ‘For sake Miss Wickfield--’ ‘My Agnes!’ he exclaimed, sickly, angular contortion himself. ‘Would good call her Agnes, Master Copperfield!’ ‘For sake Agnes Wickfield--Heaven bless her!’ ‘Thank blessing, Master Copperfield!’ he interposed. ‘I tell I should, circumstances, soon thought telling to--Jack Ketch.’ ‘To who, sir?’ said Uriah, stretching his neck, shading his ear his hand. ‘To hangman,’ I returned. ‘The unlikely person I could think of,’--though his face suggested allusion quite natural sequence. ‘I engaged another young lady. I hope contents you.’ ‘Upon soul?’ said Uriah. I indignantly give assertion confirmation he required, he caught hold hand, gave squeeze. ‘Oh, Master Copperfield!’ he said. ‘If condescension return confidence I poured fulness art, night I put much way sleeping sitting-room fire, I never doubted you. As is, I am sure I will take mother directly, appy. I know you will excuse precautions affection, will not you? What pity, Master Copperfield, did not condescend return confidence! I am sure I gave every opportunity. But never condescended me, much I could wished. I know never liked me, I liked you!’ All time he squeezing hand his damp fishy fingers, I made every effort I decently could get away. But I quite unsuccessful. He drew sleeve his mulberry-coloured great-coat, I walked on, almost upon compulsion, arm-in-arm him. ‘Shall turn?’ said Uriah, wheeling face towards town, early moon shining, silvering distant windows. ‘Before leave subject, ought understand,’ said I, breaking pretty long silence, ‘that I believe Agnes Wickfield far you, far removed aspirations, moon herself!’ ‘Peaceful! Are not she!’ said Uriah. ‘Very! Now confess, Master Copperfield, have not liked quite I liked you. All along you have thought umble now, I should not wonder?’ ‘I fond professions humility,’ I returned, ‘or professions anything else.’ ‘There now!’ said Uriah, looking flabby lead-coloured moonlight. ‘Did not I know it! But little think rightful umbleness person station, Master Copperfield! Father brought foundation school boys; mother, she likewise brought public, sort charitable, establishment. They taught us deal umbleness--not much else I know of, morning night. We umble person, umble that; pull caps here, make bows there; always know place, abase betters. And lot betters! Father got monitor-medal umble. So I. Father got made sexton umble. He character, among gentlefolks, well-behaved man, determined bring in. “Be umble, Uriah,” says father me, “and you will get on. It always dinned school; it is goes best. Be umble,” says father, “and you will do!” And really are not done bad!’ It first time ever occurred me, detestable cannot false humility might originated Heep family. I seen harvest, never thought seed. ‘When I quite young boy,’ said Uriah, ‘I got know umbleness did, I took it. I ate umble pie appetite. I stopped umble point learning, says I, “Hold hard!” When offered teach Latin, I knew better. “People like you,” says father, “keep down.” I umble present moment, Master Copperfield, I have got little power!’ And he said this--I knew, I saw his face moonlight--that I might understand he resolved recompense using his power. I never doubted his meanness, his craft malice; I fully comprehended now, first time, base, unrelenting, revengeful spirit, must engendered early, long, suppression. His account far attended agreeable result, led his withdrawing his hand order he might another hug chin. Once apart him, I determined keep apart; walked back, side side, saying little way. Whether his spirits elevated communication I made him, his indulged retrospect, I do not know; raised influence. He talked dinner usual him; asked his mother (off duty, moment re-entering house) whether he growing old bachelor; looked Agnes so, I would given I had, leave knock down. When three males left alone dinner, he got adventurous state. He taken little wine; I presume mere insolence triumph upon him, flushed perhaps temptation presence furnished exhibition. I observed yesterday, he tried entice Mr. Wickfield drink; and, interpreting look Agnes given she went out, limited one glass, proposed follow her. I would done today; Uriah quick me. ‘We seldom see present visitor, sir,’ he said, addressing Mr. Wickfield, sitting, contrast him, end table, ‘and I propose give welcome another glass two wine, objections. Mr. Copperfield, elth appiness!’ I obliged make show taking hand he stretched across me; then, different emotions, I took hand broken gentleman, his partner. ‘Come, fellow-partner,’ said Uriah, ‘if I may take liberty,--now, suppose give us something another appropriate Copperfield!’ I pass Mr. Wickfield’s proposing aunt, his proposing Mr. Dick, his proposing Doctors’ Commons, his proposing Uriah, his drinking everything twice; his consciousness his weakness, ineffectual effort he made it; struggle his shame Uriah’s deportment, his desire conciliate him; manifest exultation Uriah twisted turned, held me. It made sick heart see, hand recoils writing it. ‘Come, fellow-partner!’ said Uriah, last, ‘I will give another one, I umbly ask bumpers, seeing I intend make divinest her sex.’ Her father his empty glass his hand. I saw set down, look picture she like, put his hand his forehead, shrink back his elbow-chair. ‘I am umble individual give her elth,’ proceeded Uriah, ‘but I admire--adore her.’ No physical pain her father’s grey head could borne, I think, could terrible me, mental endurance I saw compressed within his hands. ‘Agnes,’ said Uriah, either regarding him, knowing nature his action was, ‘Agnes Wickfield is, I safe say, divinest her sex. May I speak out, among friends? To her father proud distinction, her usband--’ Spare ever hearing cry, her father rose table! ‘What is matter?’ said Uriah, turning deadly colour. ‘You gone mad, all, Mr. Wickfield, I hope? If I say I have ambition make Agnes Agnes, I good right another man. I better right man!’ I arms round Mr. Wickfield, imploring everything I could think of, oftenest his love Agnes, calm little. He mad moment; tearing his hair, beating his head, trying force him, force me, answering word, looking seeing anyone; blindly striving he knew what, his face staring distorted--a frightful spectacle. I conjured him, incoherently, impassioned manner, abandon wildness, hear me. I besought think Agnes, connect Agnes, recollect Agnes I grown together, I honoured her loved her, she his pride joy. I tried bring her idea form; I even reproached firmness spare her knowledge scene this. I may effected something, his wildness may spent itself; degrees he struggled less, began look me--strangely first, recognition his eyes. At length he said, ‘I know, Trotwood! My darling child you--I know! But look him!’ He pointed Uriah, pale glowering corner, evidently much his calculations, taken surprise. ‘Look torturer,’ he replied. ‘Before I step step abandoned name reputation, peace quiet, house home.’ ‘I kept name reputation you, peace quiet, house home too,’ said Uriah, sulky, hurried, defeated air compromise. ‘Do not foolish, Mr. Wickfield. If I gone little beyond prepared for, I go back, I suppose? There is harm done.’ ‘I looked single motives everyone,’ said Mr. Wickfield, ‘and I satisfied I bound motives interest. But see he is--oh, see he is!’ ‘You better stop him, Copperfield, can,’ cried Uriah, his long forefinger pointing towards me. ‘He will say something presently--mind you!--he will sorry said afterwards, you will sorry heard!’ ‘I will say anything!’ cried Mr. Wickfield, desperate air. ‘Why I world’s power I yours?’ ‘Mind! I tell you!’ said Uriah, continuing warn me. ‘If do not stop his mouth, you are his friend! Why should not world’s power, Mr. Wickfield? Because got daughter. You know know, do not we? Let sleeping dogs lie--who wants rouse ‘them? I do not. Cannot see I umble I be? I tell you, I have gone far, I am sorry. What would have, sir?’ ‘Oh, Trotwood, Trotwood!’ exclaimed Mr. Wickfield, wringing his hands. ‘What I come be, since I first saw house! I downward way then, dreary, dreary road I traversed since! Weak indulgence ruined me. Indulgence remembrance, indulgence forgetfulness. My natural grief child’s mother turned disease; natural love child turned disease. I infected everything I touched. I brought misery I dearly love, I know--you know! I thought possible I could truly love one creature world, love rest; I thought possible I could truly mourn one creature gone world, part grief mourned. Thus lessons life perverted! I preyed morbid coward heart, preyed me. Sordid grief, sordid love, sordid miserable escape darker side both, oh see ruin I am, hate me, shun me!’ He dropped chair, weakly sobbed. The excitement he roused leaving him. Uriah came his corner. ‘I do not know I done, fatuity,’ said Mr. Wickfield, putting his hands, deprecate condemnation. ‘He knows best,’ meaning Uriah Heep, ‘for he always elbow, whispering me. You see millstone he neck. You find house, find business. You heard him, little time ago. What need I say more!’ ‘You have not need say much, half much, anything all,’ observed Uriah, half defiant, half fawning. ‘You would not took so, had not wine. You will think better tomorrow, sir. If I said much, I meant, it? I have not stood it!’ The door opened, Agnes, gliding in, without vestige colour her face, put her arm round his neck, steadily said, ‘Papa, well. Come me!’ He laid his head upon her shoulder, he oppressed heavy shame, went her. Her eyes met mine instant, yet I saw much she knew passed. ‘I did not expect he would cut rough, Master Copperfield,’ said Uriah. ‘But it is nothing. I will friends tomorrow. It is his good. I am umbly anxious his good.’ I gave answer, went upstairs quiet room Agnes often sat beside books. Nobody came near late night. I took book, tried read. I heard clocks strike twelve, still reading, without knowing I read, Agnes touched me. ‘You going early morning, Trotwood! Let us say good-bye, now!’ She weeping, her face calm beautiful! ‘Heaven bless you!’ she said, giving her hand. ‘Dearest Agnes!’ I returned, ‘I see ask speak tonight--but nothing done?’ ‘There God trust in!’ she replied. ‘Can I nothing--I, come poor sorrows?’ ‘And make mine much lighter,’ she replied. ‘Dear Trotwood, no!’ ‘Dear Agnes,’ I said, ‘it presumptuous me, poor rich--goodness, resolution, noble qualities--to doubt direct you; know much I love you, much I owe you. You never sacrifice mistaken sense duty, Agnes?’ More agitated moment I ever seen her, she took her hands me, moved step back. ‘Say thought, dear Agnes! Much sister! Think priceless gift heart yours, love yours!’ Oh! long, long afterwards, I saw face rise me, momentary look, wondering, accusing, regretting. Oh, long, long afterwards, I saw look subside, now, lovely smile, she told she fear herself--I need none her--and parted name Brother, gone! It dark morning, I got upon coach inn door. The day breaking start, then, I sat thinking her, came struggling coach side, mingled day night, Uriah’s head. ‘Copperfield!’ said he, croaking whisper, he hung iron roof, ‘I thought you would glad hear went off, squares broke us. I have his room already, we have made smooth. Why, though I am umble, I am useful him, know; he understands his interest he is not liquor! What agreeable man he is, all, Master Copperfield!’ I obliged say I glad he made his apology. ‘Oh, sure!’ said Uriah. ‘When person’s umble, know, what is apology? So easy! I say! I suppose,’ jerk, ‘you sometimes plucked pear ripe, Master Copperfield?’ ‘I suppose I have,’ I replied. ‘I last night,’ said Uriah; ‘but it will ripen yet! It wants attending to. I wait!’ Profuse his farewells, he got coachman got up. For anything I know, he eating something keep raw morning air out; he made motions his mouth pear ripe already, he smacking his lips it. CHAPTER 40. THE WANDERER We serious conversation Buckingham Street night, domestic occurrences I detailed last chapter. My aunt deeply interested them, walked room her arms folded, two hours afterwards. Whenever she particularly discomposed, she always performed one pedestrian feats; amount her discomposure might always estimated duration her walk. On occasion she much disturbed mind find necessary open bedroom door, make course herself, comprising full extent bedrooms wall wall; Mr. Dick I sat quietly fire, she kept passing out, along measured track, unchanging pace, regularity clock-pendulum. When aunt I left Mr. Dick’s going bed, I sat write letter two old ladies. By time she tired walking, sat fire her dress tucked usual. But instead sitting her usual manner, holding her glass upon her knee, she suffered stand neglected chimney-piece; and, resting her left elbow her right arm, her chin her left hand, looked thoughtfully me. As often I raised eyes I about, I met hers. ‘I lovingest tempers, dear,’ she would assure nod, ‘but I fidgeted sorry!’ I busy observe, she gone bed, she left her night-mixture, she always called it, untasted chimney-piece. She came her door, even her usual affection manner, I knocked acquaint her discovery; said, ‘I heart take it, Trot, tonight,’ shook her head, went again. She read letter two old ladies, morning, approved it. I posted it, nothing then, wait, patiently I could, reply. I still state expectation, been, nearly week; I left Doctor’s one snowy night, walk home. It bitter day, cutting north-east wind blown time. The wind gone light, snow come on. It heavy, settled fall, I recollect, great flakes; lay thick. The noise wheels tread people hushed, streets strewn depth feathers. My shortest way home,--and I naturally took shortest way night--was St. Martin’s Lane. Now, church gives name lane, stood less free situation time; open space it, lane winding Strand. As I passed steps portico, I encountered, corner, woman’s face. It looked mine, passed across narrow lane, disappeared. I knew it. I seen somewhere. But I could remember where. I association it, struck upon heart directly; I thinking anything else came upon me, confused. On steps church, stooping figure man, put burden smooth snow, adjust it; seeing face, seeing him, simultaneous. I do not think I stopped surprise; but, case, I went on, he rose, turned, came towards me. I stood face face Mr. Peggotty! Then I remembered woman. It Martha, Emily given money night kitchen. Martha Endell--side side whom, he would seen his dear niece, Ham told me, treasures wrecked sea. We shook hands heartily. At first, neither us could speak word. ‘Mas’r Davy!’ he said, gripping tight, ‘it art good see you, sir. Well met, well met!’ ‘Well met, dear old friend!’ said I. ‘I thowts coming make inquiration you, sir, tonight,’ he said, ‘but knowing aunt living along wi’ you--fur I have yonder--Yarmouth way--I afeerd late. I come early morning, sir, afore going away.’ ‘Again?’ said I. ‘Yes, sir,’ he replied, patiently shaking his head, ‘I am away tomorrow.’ ‘Where going now?’ I asked. ‘Well!’ he replied, shaking snow his long hair, ‘I a-going turn somewheers.’ In days side-entrance stable-yard Golden Cross, inn memorable connexion his misfortune, nearly opposite stood. I pointed gateway, put arm his, went across. Two three public-rooms opened stable-yard; looking one them, finding empty, good fire burning, I took there. When I saw light, I observed, his hair long ragged, his face burnt dark sun. He greyer, lines his face forehead deeper, he every appearance toiled wandered varieties weather; he looked strong, like man upheld steadfastness purpose, nothing could tire out. He shook snow his hat clothes, brushed away his face, I inwardly making remarks. As he sat opposite table, his back door entered, he put his rough hand again, grasped mine warmly. ‘I will tell you, Mas’r Davy,’ he said,--‘wheer I have been, what-all we have heerd. I have fur, we have heerd little; I will tell you!’ I rang bell something hot drink. He would nothing stronger ale; brought, warmed fire, he sat thinking. There fine, massive gravity his face, I venture disturb. ‘When she child,’ he said, lifting his head soon left alone, ‘she used talk deal sea, coasts sea got dark blue, lay a-shining a-shining sun. I thowt, odd times, her father drownded made her think much. I doen’t know, see, maybe she believed--or hoped--he drifted parts, flowers always a-blowing, country bright.’ ‘It likely childish fancy,’ I replied. ‘When she was--lost,’ said Mr. Peggotty, ‘I know’d mind, he would take her countries. I know’d mind, he would told her wonders ‘them, she lady theer, he got her listen fust, along sech like. When see his mother, I know’d quite well I right. I went across-channel France, landed theer, I would fell sky.’ I saw door move, snow drift in. I saw move little more, hand softly interpose keep open. ‘I found English gen’leman authority,’ said Mr. Peggotty, ‘and told I a-going seek niece. He got papers I wanted fur carry through--I doen’t rightly know they are called--and he would give money, I thankful need on. I thank kind, he done, I am sure! “I have wrote afore you,” he says me, “and I shall speak many come way, many know you, fur distant here, you are a-travelling alone.” I told him, best I able, gratitoode was, went away France.’ ‘Alone, foot?’ said I. ‘Mostly a-foot,’ he rejoined; ‘sometimes carts along people going market; sometimes empty coaches. Many mile day a-foot, often poor soldier another, travelling see his friends. I could not talk him,’ said Mr. Peggotty, ‘nor he me; company one another, too, along dusty roads.’ I known his friendly tone. ‘When I come town,’ he pursued, ‘I found inn, waited yard till someone turned (someone mostly did) know’d English. Then I told I way seek niece, told manner gentlefolks house, I waited see seemed like her, going out. When warn’t Them’ly, I went agen. By little little, I come new village that, among poor people, I found know’d me. They would set cottage doors, give what-not fur eat drink, show sleep; many woman, Mas’r Davy, daughter Them’ly’s age, I have found a-waiting fur me, Our Saviour’s Cross outside village, fur sim’lar kindnesses. Some daughters dead. And God knows good mothers me!’ It Martha door. I saw her haggard, listening face distinctly. My dread lest he turn his head, see her too. ‘They would often put children--particular little girls,’ said Mr. Peggotty, ‘upon knee; many time might seen sitting doors, night coming in, a’most they would Darling’s children. Oh, Darling!’ Overpowered sudden grief, he sobbed aloud. I laid trembling hand upon hand he put his face. ‘Thankee, sir,’ he said, ‘doen’t take notice.’ In little he took his hand away put his breast, went his story. ‘They often walked me,’ he said, ‘in morning, maybe mile two upon road; parted, I said, “I am thankful you! God bless you!” always seemed understand, answered pleasant. At last I come sea. It warn’t hard, may suppose, seafaring man like work his way Italy. When I got theer, I wandered I done afore. The people good me, I gone town town, maybe country through, I got news her seen among Swiss mountains yonder. One know’d his servant see ‘them there, three, told travelled, was. I made fur mountains, Mas’r Davy, day night. Ever fur I went, ever fur mountains seemed shift away me. But I come ‘them, I crossed ‘them. When I got nigh place I told of, I began think within self, “What shall I I see her?”’ The listening face, insensible inclement night, still drooped door, hands begged me--prayed me--not cast forth. ‘I never doubted her,’ said Mr. Peggotty. ‘No! Not bit! On’y let her see face--on’y let her heer voice--on’y let stanning still afore her bring her thoughts home she fled away from, child she been--and she growed royal lady, she would fell feet! I know’d well! Many time sleep I heerd her cry out, “Uncle!” seen her fall like death afore me. Many time sleep I raised her up, whispered her, “Them’ly, dear, I come fur bring forgiveness, take home!”’ He stopped shook his head, went sigh. ‘He nowt now. Them’ly all. I bought country dress put upon her; I know’d that, found, she would walk beside stony roads, go I would, never, never, leave more. To put dress upon her, cast she wore--to take her arm again, wander towards home--to stop sometimes upon road, heal her bruised feet her worse-bruised heart--was I thowt now. I doen’t believe I done much look him. But, Mas’r Davy, warn’t be--not yet! I late, gone. Wheer, I could not learn. Some said heer, said theer. I travelled heer, I travelled theer, I found Them’ly, I travelled home.’ ‘How long ago?’ I asked. ‘A matter fower days,’ said Mr. Peggotty. ‘I sighted old boat arter dark, light a-shining winder. When I come nigh looked glass, I see faithful creetur Missis Gummidge sittin’ fire, fixed upon, alone. I called out, “Doen’t afeerd! It is Dan’l!” I went in. I never could thowt old boat would strange!’ From pocket his breast, he took out, careful hand small paper bundle containing two three letters little packets, he laid upon table. ‘This fust one come,’ he said, selecting rest, ‘afore I gone week. A fifty pound Bank note, sheet paper, directed me, put underneath door night. She tried hide her writing, she could not hide Me!’ He folded note again, great patience care, exactly form, laid one side. ‘This come Missis Gummidge,’ he said, opening another, ‘two three months ago.’ After looking moments, he gave me, added low voice, ‘Be good read it, sir.’ I read follows: ‘Oh feel see writing, know comes wicked hand! But try, try--not sake, uncle’s goodness, try let heart soften me, little little time! Try, pray do, relent towards miserable girl, write bit paper whether he well, he said left ever naming among yourselves--and whether, night, old time coming home, ever see look he thought one he used love dear. Oh, heart breaking I think it! I kneeling you, begging praying hard I deserve--as I well, well, know I deserve--but gentle good, write something him, send me. You need call Little, need call name I disgraced; oh, listen agony, mercy far write word uncle, never, never seen world eyes again! ‘Dear, heart hard towards me--justly hard, I know--but, listen, hard, dear, ask I wronged most--him whose wife I been--before quite decide poor poor prayer! If he compassionate say might write something read--I think he would, oh, I think he would, would ask him, he always brave forgiving--tell (but else), I hear wind blowing night, I feel passing angrily seeing uncle, going God me. Tell I die tomorrow (and oh, I fit, I would glad die!) I would bless uncle last words, pray his happy home last breath!’ Some money enclosed letter also. Five pounds. It untouched like previous sum, he refolded way. Detailed instructions added relative address reply, which, although betrayed intervention several hands, made difficult arrive probable conclusion reference her place concealment, made least unlikely she written spot she stated seen. ‘What answer sent?’ I inquired Mr. Peggotty. ‘Missis Gummidge,’ he returned, ‘not good scholar, sir, Ham kindly drawed out, she made copy it. They told her I gone seek her, parting words was.’ ‘Is another letter hand?’ said I. ‘It is money, sir,’ said Mr. Peggotty, unfolding little way. ‘Ten pound, see. And wrote inside, “From true friend,” like fust. But fust put underneath door, come post, day afore yesterday. I am a-going seek her post-mark.’ He showed me. It town Upper Rhine. He found out, Yarmouth, foreign dealers knew country, drawn rude map paper, he could well understand. He laid us table; and, his chin resting one hand, tracked his course upon other. I asked Ham was? He shook his head. ‘He works,’ he said, ‘as bold man can. His name’s good, part, man’s is, anywheres wureld. Anyone’s hand ready help him, understand, his ready help them. He is never heerd fur complain. But sister’s belief [‘twixt ourselves) cut deep.’ ‘Poor fellow, I believe it!’ ‘He are not care, Mas’r Davy,’ said Mr. Peggotty solemn whisper--‘kinder care no-how his life. When man’s wanted rough sarvice rough weather, he is theer. When there is hard duty done danger it, he steps for’ard afore his mates. And yet he is gentle child. There are not child Yarmouth doen’t know him.’ He gathered letters thoughtfully, smoothing his hand; put little bundle; placed tenderly his breast again. The face gone door. I still saw snow drifting in; nothing else there. ‘Well!’ he said, looking his bag, ‘having seen tonight, Mas’r Davy (and doos good!), I shall away betimes tomorrow morning. You seen I have got heer’; putting his hand little packet lay; ‘all troubles is, think harm might come me, afore money give back. If I die, lost, stole, elseways made away with, never know’d I would took it, I believe t’other wureld would not hold me! I believe I must come back!’ He rose, I rose too; grasped hand again, going out. ‘I would go ten thousand mile,’ he said, ‘I would go till I dropped dead, lay money afore him. If I that, find Them’ly, I am content. If I doen’t find her, maybe she will come hear, sometime, her loving uncle ended his search her he ended his life; I know her, even turn her home last!’ As he went rigorous night, I saw lonely figure flit away us. I turned hastily pretence, held conversation gone. He spoke traveller’s house Dover Road, he knew he could find clean, plain lodging night. I went Westminster Bridge, parted Surrey shore. Everything seemed, imagination, hushed reverence him, he resumed his solitary journey snow. I returned inn yard, and, impressed remembrance face, looked awfully around it. It there. The snow covered late footprints; new track one seen; even began die away (it snowed fast) I looked back shoulder. CHAPTER 41. DORA’S AUNTS At last, answer came two old ladies. They presented compliments Mr. Copperfield, informed given his letter best consideration, ‘with view happiness parties’--which I thought rather alarming expression, use made relation family difference before-mentioned, I (and life) observed conventional phrases sort fireworks, easily let off, liable take great variety shapes colours suggested original form. The Misses Spenlow added begged forbear expressing, ‘through medium correspondence’, opinion subject Mr. Copperfield’s communication; Mr. Copperfield would favour call, upon certain day (accompanied, he thought proper, confidential friend), would happy hold conversation subject. To favour, Mr. Copperfield immediately replied, his respectful compliments, he would honour waiting Misses Spenlow, time appointed; accompanied, accordance kind permission, his friend Mr. Thomas Traddles Inner Temple. Having dispatched missive, Mr. Copperfield fell condition strong nervous agitation; remained day arrived. It great augmentation uneasiness bereaved, eventful crisis, inestimable services Miss Mills. But Mr. Mills, always something annoy me--or I felt he were, thing--had brought his conduct climax, taking his head he would go India. Why he go India, except harass me? To sure he nothing part world, good deal part; entirely India trade, whatever (I floating dreams concerning golden shawls elephants’ teeth); Calcutta his youth; designing go again, capacity resident partner. But nothing me. However, much India he bound, Julia him; Julia went country take leave her relations; house put perfect suit bills, announcing let sold, furniture (Mangle all) taken valuation. So, another earthquake I became sport, I recovered shock predecessor! I several minds dress important day; divided desire appear advantage, apprehensions putting anything might impair severely practical character eyes Misses Spenlow. I endeavoured hit happy medium two extremes; aunt approved result; Mr. Dick threw one his shoes Traddles me, luck, went downstairs. Excellent fellow I knew Traddles be, warmly attached I was, I could help wishing, delicate occasion, he never contracted habit brushing his hair upright. It gave surprised look--not say hearth-broomy kind expression--which, apprehensions whispered, might fatal us. I took liberty mentioning Traddles, walking Putney; saying he WOULD smooth little-- ‘My dear Copperfield,’ said Traddles, lifting his hat, rubbing his hair kinds ways, ‘nothing would give greater pleasure. But will not.’ ‘Will not smoothed down?’ said I. ‘No,’ said Traddles. ‘Nothing induce it. If I carry half-hundred-weight upon it, way Putney, would moment weight taken off. You idea obstinate hair mine is, Copperfield. I quite fretful porcupine.’ I little disappointed, I must confess, thoroughly charmed his good-nature too. I told I esteemed his good-nature; said his hair must taken obstinacy his character, he none. ‘Oh!’ returned Traddles, laughing. ‘I assure you, it is quite old story, unfortunate hair. My uncle’s wife could not bear it. She said exasperated her. It stood much way, too, I first fell love Sophy. Very much!’ ‘Did she object it?’ ‘SHE did not,’ rejoined Traddles; ‘but her eldest sister--the one that is Beauty--quite made game it, I understand. In fact, sisters laugh it.’ ‘Agreeable!’ said I. ‘Yes,’ returned Traddles perfect innocence, ‘it is joke us. They pretend Sophy lock her desk, obliged shut clasped book, keep down. We laugh it.’ ‘By by, dear Traddles,’ said I, ‘your experience may suggest something me. When became engaged young lady mentioned, make regular proposal her family? Was anything like--what going today, instance?’ I added, nervously. ‘Why,’ replied Traddles, whose attentive face thoughtful shade stolen, ‘it rather painful transaction, Copperfield, case. You see, Sophy much use family, none could endure thought her ever married. Indeed, quite settled among she never married, called her old maid. Accordingly, I mentioned it, greatest precaution, Mrs. Crewler--’ ‘The mama?’ said I. ‘The mama,’ said Traddles--‘Reverend Horace Crewler--when I mentioned every possible precaution Mrs. Crewler, effect upon her she gave scream became insensible. I could not approach subject again, months.’ ‘You last?’ said I. ‘Well, Reverend Horace did,’ said Traddles. ‘He excellent man, exemplary every way; he pointed her she ought, Christian, reconcile herself sacrifice (especially uncertain), bear uncharitable feeling towards me. As myself, Copperfield, I give word, I felt perfect bird prey towards family.’ ‘The sisters took part, I hope, Traddles?’ ‘Why, I cannot say did,’ he returned. ‘When comparatively reconciled Mrs. Crewler it, break Sarah. You recollect mentioning Sarah, one something matter her spine?’ ‘Perfectly!’ ‘She clenched her hands,’ said Traddles, looking dismay; ‘shut her eyes; turned lead-colour; became perfectly stiff; took nothing two days toast-and-water, administered tea-spoon.’ ‘What unpleasant girl, Traddles!’ I remarked. ‘Oh, I beg pardon, Copperfield!’ said Traddles. ‘She charming girl, she great deal feeling. In fact, have. Sophy told afterwards, self-reproach she underwent she attendance upon Sarah, words could describe. I know must severe, feelings, Copperfield; like criminal’s. After Sarah restored, still break eight; produced various effects upon pathetic nature. The two little ones, Sophy educates, left de-testing me.’ ‘At rate, reconciled now, I hope?’ said I. ‘Ye-yes, I say were, whole, resigned it,’ said Traddles, doubtfully. ‘The fact is, avoid mentioning subject; unsettled prospects indifferent circumstances great consolation them. There deplorable scene, whenever married. It much like funeral, wedding. And they will hate taking her away!’ His honest face, he looked serio-comic shake his head, impresses remembrance reality, I time state excessive trepidation wandering mind, quite unable fix attention anything. On approaching house Misses Spenlow lived, I discount respect personal looks presence mind, Traddles proposed gentle stimulant form glass ale. This administered neighbouring public-house, he conducted me, tottering steps, Misses Spenlow’s door. I vague sensation being, were, view, maid opened it; wavering, somehow, across hall weather-glass it, quiet little drawing-room ground-floor, commanding neat garden. Also sitting here, sofa, seeing Traddles’s hair start up, his hat removed, like one obtrusive little figures made springs, fly fictitious snuff-boxes lid taken off. Also hearing old-fashioned clock ticking away chimney-piece, trying make keep time jerking heart,--which would not. Also looking round room sign Dora, seeing none. Also thinking Jip barked distance, instantly choked somebody. Ultimately I found backing Traddles fireplace, bowing great confusion two dry little elderly ladies, dressed black, looking wonderfully like preparation chip tan late Mr. Spenlow. ‘Pray,’ said one two little ladies, ‘be seated.’ When I done tumbling Traddles, sat upon something cat--my first seat was--I far recovered sight, perceive Mr. Spenlow evidently youngest family; disparity six eight years two sisters; younger appeared manager conference, inasmuch she letter her hand--so familiar looked me, yet odd!--and referring eye-glass. They dressed alike, sister wore her dress youthful air other; perhaps trifle frill, tucker, brooch, bracelet, little thing kind, made her look lively. They upright carriage, formal, precise, composed, quiet. The sister letter, her arms crossed her breast, resting other, like Idol. ‘Mr. Copperfield, I believe,’ said sister got letter, addressing herself Traddles. This frightful beginning. Traddles indicate I Mr. Copperfield, I lay claim myself, divest preconceived opinion Traddles Mr. Copperfield, altogether nice condition. To improve it, distinctly heard Jip give two short barks, receive another choke. ‘Mr. Copperfield!’ said sister letter. I something--bowed, I suppose--and attention, sister struck in. ‘My sister Lavinia,’ said she ‘being conversant matters nature, state consider calculated promote happiness parties.’ I discovered afterwards Miss Lavinia authority affairs heart, reason anciently existed certain Mr. Pidger, played short whist, supposed enamoured her. My private opinion is, entirely gratuitous assumption, Pidger altogether innocent sentiments--to he never given sort expression I could ever hear of. Both Miss Lavinia Miss Clarissa superstition, however, he would declared his passion, he cut short his youth (at sixty) over-drinking his constitution, over-doing attempt set right swilling Bath water. They lurking suspicion even, he died secret love; though I must say picture house damask nose, concealment appear ever preyed upon. ‘We not,’ said Miss Lavinia, ‘enter past history matter. Our poor brother Francis’s death cancelled that.’ ‘We not,’ said Miss Clarissa, ‘been habit frequent association brother Francis; decided division disunion us. Francis took his road; took ours. We considered conducive happiness parties so. And so.’ Each sisters leaned little forward speak, shook her head speaking, became upright silent. Miss Clarissa never moved her arms. She sometimes played tunes upon her fingers--minuets marches I think--but never moved them. ‘Our niece’s position, supposed position, much changed brother Francis’s death,’ said Miss Lavinia; ‘and therefore consider brother’s opinions regarded her position changed too. We reason doubt, Mr. Copperfield, young gentleman possessed good qualities honourable character; affection--or fully persuaded affection--for niece.’ I replied, I usually whenever I chance, nobody ever loved anybody else I loved Dora. Traddles came assistance confirmatory murmur. Miss Lavinia going make rejoinder, Miss Clarissa, appeared incessantly beset desire refer her brother Francis, struck again: ‘If Dora’s mama,’ she said, ‘when she married brother Francis, said room family dinner-table, would better happiness parties.’ ‘Sister Clarissa,’ said Miss Lavinia. ‘Perhaps need not mind now.’ ‘Sister Lavinia,’ said Miss Clarissa, ‘it belongs subject. With branch subject, alone competent speak, I think interfering. On branch subject I voice opinion. It would better happiness parties, Dora’s mama, she married brother Francis, mentioned plainly her intentions were. We known expect. We said “Pray invite us, time”; possibility misunderstanding would avoided.’ When Miss Clarissa shaken her head, Miss Lavinia resumed: referring letter her eye-glass. They little bright round twinkling eyes, way, like birds’ eyes. They unlike birds, altogether; sharp, brisk, sudden manner, little short, spruce way adjusting themselves, like canaries. Miss Lavinia, I said, resumed: ‘You ask permission sister Clarissa myself, Mr. Copperfield, visit here, accepted suitor niece.’ ‘If brother Francis,’ said Miss Clarissa, breaking again, I may call anything calm breaking out, ‘wished surround atmosphere Doctors’ Commons, Doctors’ Commons only, right desire object? None, I sure. We ever far wishing obtrude anyone. But say so? Let brother Francis his wife society. Let sister Lavinia society. We find ourselves, I hope.’ As appeared addressed Traddles me, Traddles I made sort reply. Traddles inaudible. I think I observed, myself, highly creditable concerned. I do not least know I meant. ‘Sister Lavinia,’ said Miss Clarissa, relieved her mind, ‘you go on, dear.’ Miss Lavinia proceeded: ‘Mr. Copperfield, sister Clarissa I careful indeed considering letter; considered without finally showing niece, discussing niece. We doubt think like her much.’ ‘Think, madam,’ I rapturously began, ‘oh!--’ But Miss Clarissa giving look (just like sharp canary), requesting I would interrupt oracle, I begged pardon. ‘Affection,’ said Miss Lavinia, glancing her sister corroboration, she gave form little nod every clause, ‘mature affection, homage, devotion, easily express itself. Its voice low. It modest retiring, lies ambush, waits waits. Such mature fruit. Sometimes life glides away, finds still ripening shade.’ Of course I understand allusion her supposed experience stricken Pidger; I saw, gravity Miss Clarissa nodded her head, great weight attached words. ‘The light--for I call them, comparison sentiments, light--inclinations young people,’ pursued Miss Lavinia, ‘are dust, compared rocks. It owing difficulty knowing whether likely endure real foundation, sister Clarissa undecided act, Mr. Copperfield, Mr.--’ ‘Traddles,’ said friend, finding looked at. ‘I beg pardon. Of Inner Temple, I believe?’ said Miss Clarissa, glancing letter. Traddles said ‘Exactly so,’ became pretty red face. Now, although I received express encouragement yet, I fancied I saw two little sisters, particularly Miss Lavinia, intensified enjoyment new fruitful subject domestic interest, settling make it, disposition pet it, good bright ray hope. I thought I perceived Miss Lavinia would uncommon satisfaction superintending two young lovers, like Dora me; Miss Clarissa would hardly less satisfaction seeing her superintend us, chiming her particular department subject whenever impulse strong upon her. This gave courage protest vehemently I loved Dora better I could tell, anyone believe; friends knew I loved her; aunt, Agnes, Traddles, everyone knew me, knew I loved her, earnest love made me. For truth this, I appealed Traddles. And Traddles, firing he plunging Parliamentary Debate, really come nobly: confirming good round terms, plain sensible practical manner, evidently made favourable impression. ‘I speak, I may presume say so, one little experience things,’ said Traddles, ‘being engaged young lady--one ten, Devonshire--and seeing probability, present, engagement coming termination.’ ‘You may able confirm I said, Mr. Traddles,’ observed Miss Lavinia, evidently taking new interest him, ‘of affection modest retiring; waits waits?’ ‘Entirely, madam,’ said Traddles. Miss Clarissa looked Miss Lavinia, shook her head gravely. Miss Lavinia looked consciously Miss Clarissa, heaved little sigh. ‘Sister Lavinia,’ said Miss Clarissa, ‘take smelling-bottle.’ Miss Lavinia revived herself whiffs aromatic vinegar--Traddles I looking great solicitude while; went say, rather faintly: ‘My sister great doubt, Mr. Traddles, course ought take reference likings, imaginary likings, young people friend Mr. Copperfield niece.’ ‘Our brother Francis’s child,’ remarked Miss Clarissa. ‘If brother Francis’s wife found convenient her lifetime (though she unquestionable right act she thought best) invite family her dinner-table, might known brother Francis’s child better present moment. Sister Lavinia, proceed.’ Miss Lavinia turned letter, bring superscription towards herself, referred her eye-glass orderly-looking notes she made part it. ‘It seems us,’ said she, ‘prudent, Mr. Traddles, bring feelings test observation. At present know nothing them, situation judge much reality may them. Therefore inclined far accede Mr. Copperfield’s proposal, admit his visits here.’ ‘I shall never, dear ladies,’ I exclaimed, relieved immense load apprehension, ‘forget kindness!’ ‘But,’ pursued Miss Lavinia,--‘but, would prefer regard visits, Mr. Traddles, made, present, us. We must guard recognizing positive engagement Mr. Copperfield niece, opportunity--’ ‘Until YOU opportunity, sister Lavinia,’ said Miss Clarissa. ‘Be so,’ assented Miss Lavinia, sigh--‘until I opportunity observing them.’ ‘Copperfield,’ said Traddles, turning me, ‘you feel, I sure, nothing could reasonable considerate.’ ‘Nothing!’ cried I. ‘I deeply sensible it.’ ‘In position affairs,’ said Miss Lavinia, referring her notes, ‘and admitting his visits understanding only, must require Mr. Copperfield distinct assurance, his word honour, communication kind shall take place niece without knowledge. That project whatever shall entertained regard niece, without first submitted us--’ ‘To you, sister Lavinia,’ Miss Clarissa interposed. ‘Be so, Clarissa!’ assented Miss Lavinia resignedly--‘to me--and receiving concurrence. We must make express serious stipulation, broken account. We wished Mr. Copperfield accompanied confidential friend today,’ inclination her head towards Traddles, bowed, ‘in order might doubt misconception subject. If Mr. Copperfield, you, Mr. Traddles, feel least scruple, giving promise, I beg take time consider it.’ I exclaimed, state high ecstatic fervour, moment’s consideration could necessary. I bound required promise, impassioned manner; called upon Traddles witness it; denounced atrocious characters I ever swerved least degree. ‘Stay!’ said Miss Lavinia, holding her hand; ‘we resolved, pleasure receiving two gentlemen, leave alone quarter hour, consider point. You allow us retire.’ It vain say consideration necessary. They persisted withdrawing specified time. Accordingly, little birds hopped great dignity; leaving receive congratulations Traddles, feel I translated regions exquisite happiness. Exactly expiration quarter hour, reappeared less dignity disappeared. They gone rustling away little dresses made autumn-leaves: came rustling back, like manner. I bound prescribed conditions. ‘Sister Clarissa,’ said Miss Lavinia, ‘the rest you.’ Miss Clarissa, unfolding her arms first time, took notes glanced them. ‘We shall happy,’ said Miss Clarissa, ‘to see Mr. Copperfield dinner, every Sunday, suit his convenience. Our hour three.’ I bowed. ‘In course week,’ said Miss Clarissa, ‘we shall happy see Mr. Copperfield tea. Our hour half-past six.’ I bowed again. ‘Twice week,’ said Miss Clarissa, ‘but, rule, oftener.’ I bowed again. ‘Miss Trotwood,’ said Miss Clarissa, ‘mentioned Mr. Copperfield’s letter, perhaps call upon us. When visiting better happiness parties, glad receive visits, return them. When better happiness parties visiting take place, (as case brother Francis, his establishment) quite different.’ I intimated aunt would proud delighted make acquaintance; though I must say I quite sure getting satisfactorily together. The conditions closed, I expressed acknowledgements warmest manner; and, taking hand, first Miss Clarissa, Miss Lavinia, pressed it, case, lips. Miss Lavinia arose, begging Mr. Traddles excuse us minute, requested follow her. I obeyed, tremble, conducted another room. There I found blessed darling stopping her ears behind door, her dear little face wall; Jip plate-warmer his head tied towel. Oh! How beautiful she her black frock, she sobbed cried first, would not come behind door! How fond one another, she come last; state bliss I in, took Jip plate-warmer, restored light, sneezing much, three reunited! ‘My dearest Dora! Now, indeed, ever!’ ‘Oh, DO NOT!’ pleaded Dora. ‘Please!’ ‘Are ever, Dora?’ ‘Oh yes, course I am!’ cried Dora, ‘but I frightened!’ ‘Frightened, own?’ ‘Oh yes! I do not like him,’ said Dora. ‘Why do not he go?’ ‘Who, life?’ ‘Your friend,’ said Dora. ‘It is not business his. What stupid he must be!’ ‘My love!’ (There never anything coaxing her childish ways.) ‘He best creature!’ ‘Oh, do not want best creatures!’ pouted Dora. ‘My dear,’ I argued, ‘you soon know well, like things. And aunt coming soon; you will like her things too, know her.’ ‘No, please do not bring her!’ said Dora, giving horrified little kiss, folding her hands. ‘Do not. I know she is naughty, mischief-making old thing! Do not let her come here, Doady!’ corruption David. Remonstrance use, then; I laughed, admired, much love happy; she showed Jip’s new trick standing his hind legs corner--which he space flash lightning, fell down--and I do not know long I stayed there, oblivious Traddles, Miss Lavinia come take away. Miss Lavinia fond Dora (she told Dora exactly like she herself her age--she must altered good deal), she treated Dora she toy. I wanted persuade Dora come see Traddles, proposing she ran her room locked herself in; I went Traddles without her, walked away air. ‘Nothing could satisfactory,’ said Traddles; ‘and agreeable old ladies, I sure. I should not surprised married years me, Copperfield.’ ‘Does Sophy play instrument, Traddles?’ I inquired, pride heart. ‘She knows enough piano teach her little sisters,’ said Traddles. ‘Does she sing all?’ I asked. ‘Why, she sings ballads, sometimes, freshen others little they are spirits,’ said Traddles. ‘Nothing scientific.’ ‘She does not sing guitar?’ said I. ‘Oh dear no!’ said Traddles. ‘Paint all?’ ‘Not all,’ said Traddles. I promised Traddles he hear Dora sing, see her flower-painting. He said he like much, went home arm arm great good humour delight. I encouraged talk Sophy, way; he loving reliance her I much admired. I compared her mind Dora, considerable inward satisfaction; I candidly admitted she seemed excellent kind girl Traddles, too. Of course aunt immediately made acquainted successful issue conference, said done course it. She happy see happy, promised call Dora’s aunts without loss time. But she took long walk rooms night, I writing Agnes, I began think she meant walk till morning. My letter Agnes fervent grateful one, narrating good effects resulted following her advice. She wrote, return post, me. Her letter hopeful, earnest, cheerful. She always cheerful time. I hands full ever, now. My daily journeys Highgate considered, Putney long way off; I naturally wanted go often I could. The proposed tea-drinkings quite impracticable, I compounded Miss Lavinia permission visit every Saturday afternoon, without detriment privileged Sundays. So, close every week delicious time me; I got rest week looking forward it. I wonderfully relieved find aunt Dora’s aunts rubbed on, things considered, much smoothly I could expected. My aunt made her promised visit within days conference; within days, Dora’s aunts called upon her, due state form. Similar friendly exchanges took place afterwards, usually intervals three four weeks. I know aunt distressed Dora’s aunts much, utterly setting naught dignity fly-conveyance, walking Putney extraordinary times, shortly breakfast tea; likewise wearing her bonnet manner happened comfortable her head, without deferring prejudices civilization subject. But Dora’s aunts soon agreed regard aunt eccentric somewhat masculine lady, strong understanding; although aunt occasionally ruffled feathers Dora’s aunts, expressing heretical opinions various points ceremony, she loved well sacrifice her little peculiarities general harmony. The member small society positively refused adapt circumstances, Jip. He never saw aunt without immediately displaying every tooth his head, retiring chair, growling incessantly: doleful howl, she really much his feelings. All kinds treatment tried him, coaxing, scolding, slapping, bringing Buckingham Street (where he instantly dashed two cats, terror beholders); he never could prevail upon bear aunt’s society. He would sometimes think he got better his objection, amiable minutes; would put his snub nose, howl extent, nothing blind put plate-warmer. At length, Dora regularly muffled towel shut there, whenever aunt reported door. One thing troubled much, fallen quiet train. It was, Dora seemed one consent regarded like pretty toy plaything. My aunt, she gradually became familiar, always called her Little Blossom; pleasure Miss Lavinia’s life wait upon her, curl her hair, make ornaments her, treat her like pet child. What Miss Lavinia did, her sister matter course. It odd me; seemed treat Dora, her degree, much Dora treated Jip his. I made mind speak Dora this; one day walking (for licensed Miss Lavinia, while, go walking ourselves), I said her I wished she could get behave towards her differently. ‘Because know, darling,’ I remonstrated, ‘you child.’ ‘There!’ said Dora. ‘Now you are going cross!’ ‘Cross, love?’ ‘I sure they are kind me,’ said Dora, ‘and I happy--’ ‘Well! But dearest life!’ said I, ‘you might happy, yet treated rationally.’ Dora gave reproachful look--the prettiest look!--and began sob, saying, I did not like her, I ever wanted much engaged her? And did not I go away, now, I could not bear her? What could I do, kiss away her tears, tell her I doted her, that! ‘I sure I affectionate,’ said Dora; ‘you ought not cruel me, Doady!’ ‘Cruel, precious love! As I would--or could--be cruel you, world!’ ‘Then do not find fault me,’ said Dora, making rosebud her mouth; ‘and I will good.’ I charmed her presently asking me, her accord, give her cookery-book I spoken of, show her keep accounts I promised I would. I brought volume next visit (I got prettily bound, first, make look less dry inviting); strolled Common, I showed her old housekeeping-book aunt’s, gave her set tablets, pretty little pencil-case box leads, practise housekeeping with. But cookery-book made Dora’s head ache, figures made her cry. They would not add up, she said. So she rubbed out, drew little nosegays likenesses Jip, tablets. Then I playfully tried verbal instruction domestic matters, walked Saturday afternoon. Sometimes, example, passed butcher’s shop, I would say: ‘Now suppose, pet, married, going buy shoulder mutton dinner, would know buy it?’ My pretty little Dora’s face would fall, she would make her mouth bud again, she would much prefer shut mine kiss. ‘Would know buy it, darling?’ I would repeat, perhaps, I inflexible. Dora would think little, reply, perhaps, great triumph: ‘Why, butcher would know sell it, need I know? Oh, silly boy!’ So, I asked Dora, eye cookery-book, she would do, married, I say I like nice Irish stew, she replied she would tell servant make it; clapped her little hands together across arm, laughed charming manner she delightful ever. Consequently, principal use cookery-book devoted, put corner Jip stand upon. But Dora pleased, she trained stand upon without offering come off, time hold pencil-case his mouth, I glad I bought it. And fell back guitar-case, flower-painting, songs never leaving dancing, Ta ra la! happy week long. I occasionally wished I could venture hint Miss Lavinia, she treated darling heart little much like plaything; I sometimes awoke, were, wondering find I fallen general fault, treated her like plaything too--but often. CHAPTER 42. MISCHIEF I feel record, even though manuscript intended eyes mine, hard I worked tremendous short-hand, improvement appertaining it, sense responsibility Dora her aunts. I add, I already written perseverance time life, patient continuous energy began matured within me, I know strong part character, strength all, there, looking back, I find source success. I fortunate worldly matters; many men worked much harder, succeeded half well; I never could done I done, without habits punctuality, order, diligence, without determination concentrate one object time, matter quickly successor come upon heels, I formed. Heaven knows I write this, spirit self-laudation. The man reviews his life, I mine, going here, page page, need good man indeed, he would spared sharp consciousness many talents neglected, many opportunities wasted, many erratic perverted feelings constantly war within his breast, defeating him. I hold one natural gift, I dare say, I abused. My meaning simply is, whatever I tried life, I tried heart well; whatever I devoted to, I devoted completely; great aims small, I always thoroughly earnest. I never believed possible natural improved ability claim immunity companionship steady, plain, hard-working qualities, hope gain end. There thing fulfilment earth. Some happy talent, fortunate opportunity, may form two sides ladder men mount, rounds ladder must made stuff stand wear tear; substitute thorough-going, ardent, sincere earnestness. Never put one hand anything, I could throw whole self; never affect depreciation work, whatever was; I find, now, golden rules. How much practice I reduced precept, I owe Agnes, I repeat here. My narrative proceeds Agnes, thankful love. She came visit fortnight Doctor’s. Mr. Wickfield Doctor’s old friend, Doctor wished talk him, good. It matter conversation Agnes she last town, visit result. She her father came together. I much surprised hear her she engaged find lodging neighbourhood Mrs. Heep, whose rheumatic complaint required change air, would charmed company. Neither I surprised when, next day, Uriah, like dutiful son, brought his worthy mother take possession. ‘You see, Master Copperfield,’ said he, he forced upon company turn Doctor’s garden, ‘where person loves, person little jealous--leastways, anxious keep eye beloved one.’ ‘Of jealous, now?’ said I. ‘Thanks you, Master Copperfield,’ he returned, ‘of one particular present--no male person, least.’ ‘Do mean jealous female person?’ He gave sidelong glance his sinister red eyes, laughed. ‘Really, Master Copperfield,’ he said, ‘--I say Mister, I know you will excuse abit I have got into--you are insinuating, draw like corkscrew! Well, I do not mind telling you,’ putting his fish-like hand mine, ‘I am lady’s man general, sir, I never was, Mrs. Strong.’ His eyes looked green now, watched mine rascally cunning. ‘What mean?’ said I. ‘Why, though I lawyer, Master Copperfield,’ he replied, dry grin, ‘I mean, present, I say.’ ‘And mean look?’ I retorted, quietly. ‘By look? Dear me, Copperfield, that is sharp practice! What I mean look?’ ‘Yes,’ said I. ‘By look.’ He seemed much amused, laughed heartily his nature laugh. After scraping his chin his hand, he went say, his eyes cast downward--still scraping, slowly: ‘When I umble clerk, she always looked upon me. She ever Agnes backwards forwards her ouse, she ever friend you, Master Copperfield; I far beneath her, myself, noticed.’ ‘Well?’ said I; ‘suppose were!’ ‘--And beneath too,’ pursued Uriah, distinctly, meditative tone voice, he continued scrape his chin. ‘Do not know Doctor better,’ said I, ‘than suppose conscious existence, him?’ He directed his eyes sidelong glance again, he made his face lantern-jawed, greater convenience scraping, he answered: ‘Oh dear, I referring Doctor! Oh no, poor man! I mean Mr. Maldon!’ My heart quite died within me. All old doubts apprehensions subject, Doctor’s happiness peace, mingled possibilities innocence compromise, I could unravel, I saw, moment, mercy fellow’s twisting. ‘He never could come office, without ordering shoving about,’ said Uriah. ‘One fine gentlemen he was! I meek umble--and I am. But I did not like sort thing--and I do not!’ He left scraping his chin, sucked his cheeks seemed meet inside; keeping his sidelong glance upon while. ‘She one lovely women, she is,’ he pursued, he slowly restored his face natural form; ‘and ready friend me, I know. She is person would put Agnes higher sort game. Now, I are not one lady’s men, Master Copperfield; I have eyes ed, pretty long time back. We umble ones got eyes, mostly speaking--and look ‘them.’ I endeavoured appear unconscious disquieted, but, I saw his face, poor success. ‘Now, I am a-going let run down, Copperfield,’ he continued, raising part his countenance, his red eyebrows would he any, malignant triumph, ‘and I shall I put stop friendship. I do not approve it. I do not mind acknowledging I have got rather grudging disposition, want keep intruders. I are not a-going, I know it, run risk plotted against.’ ‘You always plotting, delude belief everybody else like, I think,’ said I. ‘Perhaps so, Master Copperfield,’ he replied. ‘But I have got motive, fellow-partner used say; I go tooth nail. I must not put upon, numble person, much. I cannot allow people way. Really must come cart, Master Copperfield!’ ‘I do not understand you,’ said I. ‘Do not you, though?’ he returned, one his jerks. ‘I am astonished that, Master Copperfield, usually quick! I will try plainer, another time.---Is Mr. Maldon a-norseback, ringing gate, sir?’ ‘It looks like him,’ I replied, carelessly I could. Uriah stopped short, put his hands his great knobs knees, doubled laughter. With perfectly silent laughter. Not sound escaped him. I repelled his odious behaviour, particularly concluding instance, I turned away without ceremony; left doubled middle garden, like scarecrow want support. It evening; but, I well remember, next evening one, Sunday; I took Agnes see Dora. I arranged visit, beforehand, Miss Lavinia; Agnes expected tea. I flutter pride anxiety; pride dear little betrothed, anxiety Agnes like her. All way Putney, Agnes inside stage-coach, I outside, I pictured Dora every one pretty looks I knew well; making mind I like her look exactly she looked time, doubting whether I prefer her looking she looked another time; almost worrying fever it. I troubled doubt her pretty, case; fell I never seen her look well. She drawing-room I presented Agnes her little aunts, shyly keeping way. I knew look her, now; sure enough I found her stopping her ears again, behind dull old door. At first she would not come all; she pleaded five minutes watch. When length she put her arm mine, taken drawing-room, her charming little face flushed, never pretty. But, went room, turned pale, she ten thousand times prettier yet. Dora afraid Agnes. She told she knew Agnes ‘too clever’. But she saw her looking cheerful earnest, thoughtful, good, she gave faint little cry pleased surprise, put her affectionate arms round Agnes’s neck, laid her innocent cheek her face. I never happy. I never pleased I saw two sit together, side side. As I saw little darling looking naturally cordial eyes. As I saw tender, beautiful regard Agnes cast upon her. Miss Lavinia Miss Clarissa partook, way, joy. It pleasantest tea-table world. Miss Clarissa presided. I cut handed sweet seed-cake--the little sisters bird-like fondness picking seeds pecking sugar; Miss Lavinia looked benignant patronage, happy love her work; perfectly contented one another. The gentle cheerfulness Agnes went hearts. Her quiet interest everything interested Dora; her manner making acquaintance Jip (who responded instantly); her pleasant way, Dora ashamed come her usual seat me; her modest grace ease, eliciting crowd blushing little marks confidence Dora; seemed make circle quite complete. ‘I glad,’ said Dora, tea, ‘that like me. I did not think would; I want, ever, liked, Julia Mills gone.’ I omitted mention it, by. Miss Mills sailed, Dora I gone aboard great East Indiaman Gravesend see her; preserved ginger, guava, delicacies sort lunch; left Miss Mills weeping camp-stool quarter-deck, large new diary her arm, original reflections awakened contemplation Ocean recorded lock key. Agnes said she afraid I must given her unpromising character; Dora corrected directly. ‘Oh no!’ she said, shaking her curls me; ‘it praise. He thinks much opinion, I quite afraid it.’ ‘My good opinion cannot strengthen his attachment people he knows,’ said Agnes, smile; ‘it worth having.’ ‘But please let it,’ said Dora, her coaxing way, ‘if can!’ We made merry Dora’s wanting liked, Dora said I goose, she did not like rate, short evening flew away gossamer-wings. The time hand coach call us. I standing alone fire, Dora came stealing softly in, give usual precious little kiss I went. ‘Do not think, I her friend long time ago, Doady,’ said Dora, her bright eyes shining brightly, her little right hand idly busying one buttons coat, ‘I might clever perhaps?’ ‘My love!’ said I, ‘what nonsense!’ ‘Do think nonsense?’ returned Dora, without looking me. ‘Are sure is?’ ‘Of course I am!’ ‘I forgotten,’ said Dora, still turning button round round, ‘what relation Agnes you, dear bad boy.’ ‘No blood-relation,’ I replied; ‘but brought together, like brother sister.’ ‘I wonder ever fell love me?’ said Dora, beginning another button coat. ‘Perhaps I could not see you, love you, Dora!’ ‘Suppose never seen all,’ said Dora, going another button. ‘Suppose never born!’ said I, gaily. I wondered she thinking about, I glanced admiring silence little soft hand travelling row buttons coat, clustering hair lay breast, lashes her downcast eyes, slightly rising followed her idle fingers. At length her eyes lifted mine, she stood tiptoe give me, thoughtfully usual, precious little kiss--once, twice, three times--and went room. They came back together within five minutes afterwards, Dora’s unusual thoughtfulness quite gone then. She laughingly resolved put Jip whole his performances, coach came. They took time (not much account variety, Jip’s reluctance), still unfinished heard door. There hurried affectionate parting Agnes herself; Dora write Agnes (who mind her letters foolish, she said), Agnes write Dora; second parting coach door, third Dora, spite remonstrances Miss Lavinia, would come running remind Agnes coach window writing, shake her curls box. The stage-coach put us near Covent Garden, take another stage-coach Highgate. I impatient short walk interval, Agnes might praise Dora me. Ah! praise was! How lovingly fervently commend pretty creature I won, her artless graces best displayed, gentle care! How thoughtfully remind me, yet pretence so, trust I held orphan child! Never, never, I loved Dora deeply truly, I loved her night. When alighted, walking starlight along quiet road led Doctor’s house, I told Agnes her doing. ‘When sitting her,’ said I, ‘you seemed less her guardian angel mine; seem now, Agnes.’ ‘A poor angel,’ she returned, ‘but faithful.’ The clear tone her voice, going straight heart, made natural say: ‘The cheerfulness belongs you, Agnes (and one else ever I seen), restored, I observed today, I begun hope happier home?’ ‘I happier myself,’ she said; ‘I quite cheerful light-hearted.’ I glanced serene face looking upward, thought stars made seem noble. ‘There change home,’ said Agnes, moments. ‘No fresh reference,’ said I, ‘to--I would not distress you, Agnes, I cannot help asking--to spoke of, parted last?’ ‘No, none,’ she answered. ‘I thought much it.’ ‘You must think less it. Remember I confide simple love truth last. Have apprehensions me, Trotwood,’ she added, moment; ‘the step dread taking, I shall never take.’ Although I think I never really feared it, season cool reflection, unspeakable relief assurance her truthful lips. I told her so, earnestly. ‘And visit over,’ said I,--‘for may alone another time,--how long likely be, dear Agnes, come London again?’ ‘Probably long time,’ she replied; ‘I think best--for papa’s sake--to remain home. We likely meet often, time come; I shall good correspondent Dora’s, shall frequently hear one another way.’ We within little courtyard Doctor’s cottage. It growing late. There light window Mrs. Strong’s chamber, Agnes, pointing it, bade good night. ‘Do troubled,’ she said, giving her hand, ‘by misfortunes anxieties. I happier nothing happiness. If ever give help, rely upon I ask it. God bless always!’ In her beaming smile, last tones her cheerful voice, I seemed see hear little Dora her company. I stood awhile, looking porch stars, heart full love gratitude, walked slowly forth. I engaged bed decent alehouse close by, going gate, when, happening turn head, I saw light Doctor’s study. A half-reproachful fancy came mind, he working Dictionary without help. With view seeing so, and, case, bidding good night, he yet sitting among his books, I turned back, going softly across hall, gently opening door, looked in. The first person I saw, surprise, sober light shaded lamp, Uriah. He standing close beside it, one his skeleton hands his mouth, resting Doctor’s table. The Doctor sat his study chair, covering his face his hands. Mr. Wickfield, sorely troubled distressed, leaning forward, irresolutely touching Doctor’s arm. For instant, I supposed Doctor ill. I hastily advanced step impression, I met Uriah’s eye, saw matter. I would withdrawn, Doctor made gesture detain me, I remained. ‘At rate,’ observed Uriah, writhe his ungainly person, ‘we may keep door shut. We need not make known ALL town.’ Saying which, he went his toes door, I left open, carefully closed it. He came back, took his former position. There obtrusive show compassionate zeal his voice manner, intolerable--at least me--than demeanour he could assumed. ‘I felt incumbent upon me, Master Copperfield,’ said Uriah, ‘to point Doctor Strong already talked about. You did not exactly understand me, though?’ I gave look, answer; and, going good old master, said words I meant words comfort encouragement. He put his hand upon shoulder, his custom I quite little fellow, lift his grey head. ‘As did not understand me, Master Copperfield,’ resumed Uriah officious manner, ‘I may take liberty umbly mentioning, among friends, I called Doctor Strong’s attention goings-on Mrs. Strong. It is much grain me, I assure you, Copperfield, concerned anything unpleasant; really, is, we are mixing ought not be. That meaning was, sir, did not understand me.’ I wonder now, I recall his leer, I collar him, try shake breath his body. ‘I dare say I did not make clear,’ he went on, ‘nor neither. Naturally, us inclined give subject wide berth. How Is’ever, last I made mind speak plain; I mentioned Doctor Strong that--did speak, sir?’ This Doctor, moaned. The sound might touched heart, I thought, effect upon Uriah’s. ‘--mentioned Doctor Strong,’ he proceeded, ‘that anyone may see Mr. Maldon, lovely agreeable lady Doctor Strong’s wife, sweet one another. Really time come (we present mixing ought not be), Doctor Strong must told full plain everybody sun, Mr. Maldon went India; Mr. Maldon made excuses come back, nothing else; he is always here, nothing else. When come in, sir, I putting fellow-partner,’ towards he turned, ‘to say Doctor Strong upon his word honour, whether he would ever opinion long ago, not. Come, Mr. Wickfield, sir! Would good tell us? Yes no, sir? Come, partner!’ ‘For God’s sake, dear Doctor,’ said Mr. Wickfield laying his irresolute hand upon Doctor’s arm, ‘do not attach much weight suspicions I may entertained.’ ‘There!’ cried Uriah, shaking his head. ‘What melancholy confirmation: are not it? Him! Such old friend! Bless soul, I nothing clerk his office, Copperfield, I have seen twenty times, I have seen once, quite taking it--quite put out, know (and proper father; I am sure I cannot blame him), think Miss Agnes mixing herself ought not be.’ ‘My dear Strong,’ said Mr. Wickfield tremulous voice, ‘my good friend, I need not tell vice look one master motive everybody, try actions one narrow test. I may fallen doubts I had, mistake.’ ‘You doubts, Wickfield,’ said Doctor, without lifting his head. ‘You doubts.’ ‘Speak up, fellow-partner,’ urged Uriah. ‘I had, one time, certainly,’ said Mr. Wickfield. ‘I--God forgive me--I thought YOU had.’ ‘No, no, no!’ returned Doctor, tone pathetic grief. ‘I thought, one time,’ said Mr. Wickfield, ‘that wished send Maldon abroad effect desirable separation.’ ‘No, no, no!’ returned Doctor. ‘To give Annie pleasure, making provision companion her childhood. Nothing else.’ ‘So I found,’ said Mr. Wickfield. ‘I could not doubt it, told so. But I thought--I implore remember narrow construction besetting sin--that, case much disparity point years--’ ‘That is way put it, see, Master Copperfield!’ observed Uriah, fawning offensive pity. ‘--a lady youth, attractions, however real her respect you, might influenced marrying, worldly considerations only. I make allowance innumerable feelings circumstances may tended good. For Heaven’s sake remember that!’ ‘How kind he puts it!’ said Uriah, shaking his head. ‘Always observing her one point view,’ said Mr. Wickfield; ‘but dear you, old friend, I entreat consider was; I forced confess now, escape-’ ‘No! There is way it, Mr. Wickfield, sir,’ observed Uriah, ‘when it is got this.’ ‘--that I did,’ said Mr. Wickfield, glancing helplessly distractedly his partner, ‘that I doubt her, think her wanting her duty you; I sometimes, I must say all, feel averse Agnes familiar relation towards her, see I saw, diseased theory fancied I saw. I never mentioned anyone. I never meant known anyone. And though terrible hear,’ said Mr. Wickfield, quite subdued, ‘if knew terrible tell, would feel compassion me!’ The Doctor, perfect goodness his nature, put his hand. Mr. Wickfield held little his, his head bowed down. ‘I sure,’ said Uriah, writhing silence like Conger-eel, ‘that subject full unpleasantness everybody. But since got far, I ought take liberty mentioning Copperfield noticed too.’ I turned upon him, asked he dared refer me! ‘Oh! it is kind you, Copperfield,’ returned Uriah, undulating over, ‘and know amiable character is; know moment I spoke night, knew I meant. You know knew I meant, Copperfield. Do not deny it! You deny best intentions; do not it, Copperfield.’ I saw mild eye good old Doctor turned upon moment, I felt confession old misgivings remembrances plainly written face overlooked. It use raging. I could undo that. Say I would, I could unsay it. We silent again, remained so, Doctor rose walked twice thrice across room. Presently he returned his chair stood; and, leaning back it, occasionally putting his handkerchief his eyes, simple honesty honour, thinking, disguise he could effected, said: ‘I much blame. I believe I much blame. I exposed one I hold heart, trials aspersions--I call aspersions, even conceived anybody’s inmost mind--of she never, me, could object.’ Uriah Heep gave kind snivel. I think express sympathy. ‘Of Annie,’ said Doctor, ‘never, me, could object. Gentlemen, I old now, know; I feel, tonight, I much live for. But life--my Life--upon truth honour dear lady subject conversation!’ I think best embodiment chivalry, realization handsomest romantic figure ever imagined painter, could said this, impressive affecting dignity plain old Doctor did. ‘But I prepared,’ he went on, ‘to deny--perhaps I may been, without knowing it, degree prepared admit--that I may unwittingly ensnared lady unhappy marriage. I man quite unaccustomed observe; I cannot believe observation several people, different ages positions, plainly tending one direction (and natural), better mine.’ I often admired, I elsewhere described, his benignant manner towards his youthful wife; respectful tenderness he manifested every reference her occasion, almost reverential manner he put away lightest doubt her integrity, exalted him, eyes, beyond description. ‘I married lady,’ said Doctor, ‘when she extremely young. I took her her character scarcely formed. So far developed, happiness form it. I knew her father well. I knew her well. I taught her I could, love her beautiful virtuous qualities. If I her wrong; I fear I did, taking advantage (but I never meant it) her gratitude her affection; I ask pardon lady, heart!’ He walked across room, came back place; holding chair grasp trembled, like his subdued voice, earnestness. ‘I regarded refuge, her, dangers vicissitudes life. I persuaded that, unequal though years, she would live tranquilly contentedly me. I shut consideration time I leave her free, still young still beautiful, her judgement matured--no, gentlemen--upon truth!’ His homely figure seemed lightened his fidelity generosity. Every word he uttered force grace could imparted it. ‘My life lady happy. Until tonight, I uninterrupted occasion bless day I her great injustice.’ His voice, faltering utterance words, stopped moments; he went on: ‘Once awakened dream--I poor dreamer, one way other, life--I see natural she regretful feeling towards her old companion her equal. That she regard innocent regret, blameless thoughts might been, me, is, I fear, true. Much I seen, noted, come back upon new meaning, last trying hour. But, beyond this, gentlemen, dear lady’s name never must coupled word, breath, doubt.’ For little while, his eye kindled his voice firm; little he silent. Presently, he proceeded before: ‘It remains me, bear knowledge unhappiness I occasioned, submissively I can. It she reproach; I. To save her misconstruction, cruel misconstruction, even friends able avoid, becomes duty. The retired live, better I shall discharge it. And time comes--may come soon, His merciful pleasure!--when death shall release her constraint, I shall close eyes upon her honoured face, unbounded confidence love; leave her, sorrow then, happier brighter days.’ I could see tears his earnestness goodness, adorned by, adorning, perfect simplicity his manner, brought eyes. He moved door, he added: ‘Gentlemen, I shown heart. I sure respect it. What said tonight never said more. Wickfield, give old friend’s arm upstairs!’ Mr. Wickfield hastened him. Without interchanging word went slowly room together, Uriah looking them. ‘Well, Master Copperfield!’ said Uriah, meekly turning me. ‘The thing has not took quite turn might expected, old Scholar--what excellent man!--is blind brickbat; family’s cart, I think!’ I needed sound his voice madly enraged I never before, never since. ‘You villain,’ said I, ‘what mean entrapping schemes? How dare appeal now, false rascal, discussion together?’ As stood, front front, I saw plainly, stealthy exultation his face, I already plainly knew; I mean he forced his confidence upon me, expressly make miserable, set deliberate trap matter; I could not bear it. The whole his lank cheek invitingly me, I struck open hand force fingers tingled I burnt them. He caught hand his, stood connexion, looking other. We stood so, long time; long enough see white marks fingers die deep red his cheek, leave deeper red. ‘Copperfield,’ he said length, breathless voice, ‘have taken leave senses?’ ‘I taken leave you,’ said I, wresting hand away. ‘You dog, I will know you.’ ‘Will not you?’ said he, constrained pain his cheek put his hand there. ‘Perhaps will not able help it. Is not ungrateful you, now?’ ‘I shown often enough,’ said I, ‘that I despise you. I shown now, plainly, I do. Why I dread worst you? What else ever do?’ He perfectly understood allusion considerations hitherto restrained communications him. I rather think neither blow, allusion, would escaped me, assurance I Agnes night. It matter. There another long pause. His eyes, he looked me, seemed take every shade colour could make eyes ugly. ‘Copperfield,’ he said, removing his hand his cheek, ‘you always gone me. I know always used Mr. Wickfield’s.’ ‘You may think like,’ said I, still towering rage. ‘If true, much worthier you.’ ‘And yet I always liked you, Copperfield!’ he rejoined. I deigned make reply; and, taking hat, going bed, he came door. ‘Copperfield,’ he said, ‘there must two parties quarrel. I will not one.’ ‘You may go devil!’ said I. ‘Do not say that!’ he replied. ‘I know you will sorry afterwards. How make inferior me, show bad spirit? But I forgive you.’ ‘You forgive me!’ I repeated disdainfully. ‘I do, cannot help yourself,’ replied Uriah. ‘To think going attacking me, always friend you! But cannot quarrel without two parties, I will not one. I friend you, spite you. So know you have got expect.’ The necessity carrying dialogue (his part slow; mine quick) low tone, house might disturbed unseasonable hour, improve temper; though passion cooling down. Merely telling I expect I always expected, never yet disappointed in, I opened door upon him, he great walnut put cracked, went house. But he slept house too, his mother’s lodging; I gone many hundred yards, came me. ‘You know, Copperfield,’ he said, ear (I turn head), ‘you are quite wrong position’; I felt true, made chafe more; ‘you cannot make brave thing, cannot help forgiven. I do not intend mention mother, living soul. I am determined forgive you. But I wonder lift hand person knew umble!’ I felt less mean he. He knew better I knew myself. If he retorted openly exasperated me, would relief justification; he put slow fire, I lay tormented half night. In morning, I came out, early church-bell ringing, he walking his mother. He addressed nothing happened, I could less reply. I struck hard enough give toothache, I suppose. At events his face tied black silk handkerchief, which, his hat perched top it, far improving his appearance. I heard he went dentist’s London Monday morning, tooth out. I hope double one. The Doctor gave he quite well; remained alone, considerable part every day, remainder visit. Agnes her father gone week, resumed usual work. On day preceding resumption, Doctor gave his hands folded note sealed. It addressed myself; laid injunction me, affectionate words, never refer subject evening. I confided aunt, one else. It subject I could discuss Agnes, Agnes certainly least suspicion passed. Neither, I felt convinced, Mrs. Strong then. Several weeks elapsed I saw least change her. It came slowly, like cloud wind. At first, she seemed wonder gentle compassion Doctor spoke her, his wish she her mother her, relieve dull monotony her life. Often, work, she sitting by, I would see her pausing looking memorable face. Afterwards, I sometimes observed her rise, her eyes full tears, go room. Gradually, unhappy shadow fell upon her beauty, deepened every day. Mrs. Markleham regular inmate cottage then; she talked talked, saw nothing. As change stole Annie, like sunshine Doctor’s house, Doctor became older appearance, grave; sweetness his temper, placid kindness his manner, his benevolent solicitude her, capable increase, increased. I saw once, early morning her birthday, she came sit window work (which she always done, began timid uncertain air I thought touching), take her forehead his hands, kiss it, go hurriedly away, much moved remain. I saw her stand he left her, like statue; bend her head, clasp her hands, weep, I cannot say sorrowfully. Sometimes, that, I fancied she tried speak even me, intervals left alone. But she never uttered word. The Doctor always new project her participating amusements away home, her mother; Mrs. Markleham, fond amusements, easily dissatisfied anything else, entered great good-will, loud her commendations. But Annie, spiritless unhappy way, went whither she led, seemed care anything. I know think. Neither aunt; must walked, various times, hundred miles her uncertainty. What strangest was, real relief seemed make way secret region domestic unhappiness, made way person Mr. Dick. What his thoughts subject, his observation was, I unable explain, I dare say he would assist task. But, I recorded narrative school days, his veneration Doctor unbounded; subtlety perception real attachment, even borne towards man one lower animals, leaves highest intellect behind. To mind heart, I may call so, Mr. Dick, bright ray truth shot straight. He proudly resumed his privilege, many his spare hours, walking garden Doctor; he accustomed pace The Doctor’s Walk Canterbury. But matters sooner state, he devoted his spare time (and got earlier make more) perambulations. If he never happy Doctor read marvellous performance, Dictionary, him; he quite miserable unless Doctor pulled his pocket, began. When Doctor I engaged, he fell custom walking Mrs. Strong, helping her trim her favourite flowers, weed beds. I dare say he rarely spoke dozen words hour: his quiet interest, his wistful face, found immediate response breasts; knew liked him, he loved both; he became one else could be--a link them. When I think him, his impenetrably wise face, walking Doctor, delighted battered hard words Dictionary; I think carrying huge watering-pots Annie; kneeling down, paws gloves, patient microscopic work among little leaves; expressing philosopher could expressed, everything he did, delicate desire her friend; showering sympathy, trustfulness, affection, every hole watering-pot; I think never wandering better mind his unhappiness addressed itself, never bringing unfortunate King Charles garden, never wavering his grateful service, never diverted his knowledge something wrong, his wish set right--I really feel almost ashamed known he quite his wits, taking account utmost I done mine. ‘Nobody myself, Trot, knows man is!’ aunt would proudly remark, conversed it. ‘Dick distinguish yet!’ I must refer one topic I close chapter. While visit Doctor’s still progress, I observed postman brought two three letters every morning Uriah Heep, remained Highgate rest went back, leisure time; always directed business-like manner Mr. Micawber, assumed round legal hand. I glad infer, slight premises, Mr. Micawber well; consequently much surprised receive, time, following letter his amiable wife. ‘CANTERBURY, Monday Evening. ‘You doubtless surprised, dear Mr. Copperfield, receive communication. Still so, contents. Still so, stipulation implicit confidence I beg impose. But feelings wife mother require relief; I wish consult family (already obnoxious feelings Mr. Micawber), I know one I better ask advice friend former lodger. ‘You may aware, dear Mr. Copperfield, Mr. Micawber (whom I never desert), always preserved spirit mutual confidence. Mr. Micawber may occasionally given bill without consulting me, he may misled period obligation would become due. This actually happened. But, general, Mr. Micawber secrets bosom affection--I allude his wife--and invariably, retirement rest, recalled events day. ‘You picture yourself, dear Mr. Copperfield, poignancy feelings must be, I inform Mr. Micawber entirely changed. He reserved. He secret. His life mystery partner his joys sorrows--I allude his wife--and I assure beyond knowing passed morning night office, I know less I man south, connected whose mouth thoughtless children repeat idle tale respecting cold plum porridge, I adopt popular fallacy express actual fact. ‘But all.

CHAPTER 43. ANOTHER RETROSPECT Once again, let pause upon memorable period life. Let stand aside, see phantoms days go me, accompanying shadow myself, dim procession. Weeks, months, seasons, pass along. They seem little summer day winter evening. Now, Common I walk Dora bloom, field bright gold; unseen heather lies mounds bunches underneath covering snow. In breath, river flows Sunday walks sparkling summer sun, ruffled winter wind, thickened drifting heaps ice. Faster ever river ran towards sea, flashes, darkens, rolls away. Not thread changes, house two little bird-like ladies. The clock ticks fireplace, weather-glass hangs hall. Neither clock weather-glass ever right; believe both, devoutly. I come legally man’s estate. I attained dignity twenty-one. But sort dignity may thrust upon one. Let think I achieved. I tamed savage stenographic mystery. I make respectable income it. I high repute accomplishment pertaining art, joined eleven others reporting debates Parliament Morning Newspaper. Night night, I record predictions never come pass, professions never fulfilled, explanations meant mystify. I wallow words. Britannia, unfortunate female, always me, like trussed fowl: skewered office-pens, bound hand foot red tape. I sufficiently behind scenes know worth political life. I quite Infidel it, shall never converted. My dear old Traddles tried his hand pursuit, Traddles’s way. He perfectly good-humoured respecting his failure, reminds he always consider slow. He occasional employment newspaper, getting facts dry subjects, written embellished fertile minds. He called bar; admirable industry self-denial scraped another hundred pounds together, fee Conveyancer whose chambers he attends. A great deal hot port wine consumed his call; and, considering figure, I think Inner Temple must made profit it. I come another way. I taken fear trembling authorship. I wrote little something, secret, sent magazine, published magazine. Since then, I taken heart write good many trifling pieces. Now, I regularly paid them. Altogether, I well off, I tell income fingers left hand, I pass third finger take fourth middle joint. We removed, Buckingham Street, pleasant little cottage near one I looked at, enthusiasm first came on. My aunt, however (who sold house Dover, good advantage), going remain here, intends removing herself still tiny cottage close hand. What portend? My marriage? Yes! Yes! I going married Dora! Miss Lavinia Miss Clarissa given consent; ever canary birds flutter, are. Miss Lavinia, self-charged superintendence darling’s wardrobe, constantly cutting brown-paper cuirasses, differing opinion highly respectable young man, long bundle, yard measure his arm. A dressmaker, always stabbed breast needle thread, boards lodges house; seems me, eating, drinking, sleeping, never take her thimble off. They make lay-figure dear. They always sending her come try something on. We cannot happy together five minutes evening, intrusive female knocks door, says, ‘Oh, please, Miss Dora, would step upstairs!’ Miss Clarissa aunt roam London, find articles furniture Dora look at. It would better buy goods once, without ceremony inspection; for, go see kitchen fender meat-screen, Dora sees Chinese house Jip, little bells top, prefers that. And takes long time accustom Jip his new residence, bought it; whenever he goes out, he makes little bells ring, horribly frightened. Peggotty comes make herself useful, falls work immediately. Her department appears be, clean everything again. She rubs everything rubbed, shines, like her honest forehead, perpetual friction. And is, I begin see her solitary brother passing dark streets night, looking, he goes, among wandering faces. I never speak hour. I know well, his grave figure passes onward, he seeks, he dreads. Why Traddles look important he calls upon afternoon Commons--where I still occasionally attend, form’s sake, I time? The realization boyish day-dreams hand. I going take licence. It little document much; Traddles contemplates it, lies upon desk, half admiration, half awe. There names, sweet old visionary connexion, David Copperfield Dora Spenlow; there, corner, Parental Institution, Stamp Office, benignantly interested various transactions human life, looking upon Union; Archbishop Canterbury invoking blessing us print, cheap could possibly expected. Nevertheless, I dream, flustered, happy, hurried dream. I cannot believe going be; yet I cannot believe everyone I pass street, must kind perception, I married day tomorrow. The Surrogate knows me, I go sworn; disposes easily, Masonic understanding us. Traddles wanted, attendance general backer. ‘I hope next time come here, dear fellow,’ I say Traddles, ‘it errand yourself. And I hope soon.’ ‘Thank good wishes, dear Copperfield,’ he replies. ‘I hope too. It is satisfaction know she will wait length time, she really dearest girl--’ ‘When meet her coach?’ I ask. ‘At seven,’ says Traddles, looking his plain old silver watch--the watch he took wheel of, school, make water-mill. ‘That Miss Wickfield’s time, not?’ ‘A little earlier. Her time half past eight.’ ‘I assure you, dear boy,’ says Traddles, ‘I almost pleased I going married myself, think event coming happy termination. And really great friendship consideration personally associating Sophy joyful occasion, inviting her bridesmaid conjunction Miss Wickfield, demands warmest thanks. I extremely sensible it.’ I hear him, shake hands him; talk, walk, dine, on; I do not believe it. Nothing real. Sophy arrives house Dora’s aunts, due course. She agreeable faces,--not absolutely beautiful, extraordinarily pleasant,--and one genial, unaffected, frank, engaging creatures I ever seen. Traddles presents her us great pride; rubs his hands ten minutes clock, every individual hair upon his head standing tiptoe, I congratulate corner his choice. I brought Agnes Canterbury coach, her cheerful beautiful face among us second time. Agnes great liking Traddles, capital see meet, observe glory Traddles he commends dearest girl world her acquaintance. Still I do not believe it. We delightful evening, supremely happy; I do not believe yet. I cannot collect myself. I cannot check happiness takes place. I feel misty unsettled kind state; I got early morning week two ago, never bed since. I cannot make yesterday was. I seem carrying licence about, pocket, many months. Next day, too, go flock see house--our house--Dora’s mine--I quite unable regard master. I seem there, permission somebody else. I half expect real master come home presently, say he glad see me. Such beautiful little house is, everything bright new; flowers carpets looking freshly gathered, green leaves paper come out; spotless muslin curtains, blushing rose-coloured furniture, Dora’s garden hat blue ribbon--do I remember, now, I loved her another hat I first knew her!--already hanging little peg; guitar-case quite home heels corner; everybody tumbling Jip’s pagoda, much big establishment. Another happy evening, quite unreal rest it, I steal usual room going away. Dora there. I suppose done trying yet. Miss Lavinia peeps in, tells mysteriously she long. She rather long, notwithstanding; I hear rustling door, someone taps. I say, ‘Come in!’ someone taps again. I go door, wondering is; there, I meet pair bright eyes, blushing face; Dora’s eyes face, Miss Lavinia dressed her tomorrow’s dress, bonnet all, see. I take little wife heart; Miss Lavinia gives little scream I tumble bonnet, Dora laughs cries once, I pleased; I believe less ever. ‘Do think pretty, Doady?’ says Dora. Pretty! I rather think I did. ‘And sure like much?’ says Dora. The topic fraught danger bonnet, Miss Lavinia gives another little scream, begs understand Dora looked at, account touched. So Dora stands delightful state confusion minute two, admired; takes her bonnet--looking natural without it!--and runs away her hand; comes dancing her familiar dress, asks Jip I got beautiful little wife, whether he will forgive her married, kneels make stand upon cookery-book, last time her single life. I go home, incredulous ever, lodging I hard by; get early morning, ride Highgate road fetch aunt. I never seen aunt state. She dressed lavender-coloured silk, white bonnet on, amazing. Janet dressed her, look me. Peggotty ready go church, intending behold ceremony gallery. Mr. Dick, give darling altar, his hair curled. Traddles, I taken appointment turnpike, presents dazzling combination cream colour light blue; he Mr. Dick general effect gloves. No doubt I see this, I know so; I astray, seem see nothing. Nor I believe anything whatever. Still, drive along open carriage, fairy marriage real enough fill sort wondering pity unfortunate people part it, sweeping shops, going daily occupations. My aunt sits hand way. When stop little way short church, put Peggotty, brought box, she gives squeeze, kiss. ‘God bless you, Trot! My boy never could dearer. I think poor dear Baby morning.’ ‘So I. And I owe you, dear aunt.’ ‘Tut, child!’ says aunt; gives her hand overflowing cordiality Traddles, gives his Mr. Dick, gives his me, gives mine Traddles, come church door. The church calm enough, I sure; might steam-power loom full action, sedative effect me. I far gone that. The rest less incoherent dream. A dream coming Dora; pew-opener arranging us, like drill-sergeant, altar rails; wondering, even then, pew-openers must always disagreeable females procurable, whether religious dread disastrous infection good-humour renders indispensable set vessels vinegar upon road Heaven. Of clergyman clerk appearing; boatmen people strolling in; ancient mariner behind me, strongly flavouring church rum; service beginning deep voice, attentive. Of Miss Lavinia, acts semi-auxiliary bridesmaid, first cry, her homage (as I take it) memory Pidger, sobs; Miss Clarissa applying smelling-bottle; Agnes taking care Dora; aunt endeavouring represent herself model sternness, tears rolling her face; little Dora trembling much, making her responses faint whispers. Of kneeling together, side side; Dora’s trembling less less, always clasping Agnes hand; service got through, quietly gravely; looking April state smiles tears, over; young wife hysterical vestry, crying her poor papa, her dear papa. Of her soon cheering again, signing register round. Of going gallery Peggotty bring her sign it; Peggotty’s hugging corner, telling she saw dear mother married; over, going away. Of walking proudly lovingly aisle sweet wife upon arm, mist half-seen people, pulpits, monuments, pews, fonts, organs, church windows, flutter faint airs association childish church home, long ago. Of whispering, pass, youthful couple are, pretty little wife she is. Of merry talkative carriage going back. Of Sophy telling us she saw Traddles (whom I entrusted licence) asked it, she almost fainted, convinced he would contrive lose it, his pocket picked. Of Agnes laughing gaily; Dora fond Agnes she separated her, still keeps her hand. Of breakfast, abundance things, pretty substantial, eat drink, whereof I partake, I dream, without least perception flavour; eating drinking, I may say, nothing love marriage, believing viands anything else. Of making speech dreamy fashion, without idea I want say, beyond may comprehended full conviction I have not said it. Of sociably simply happy (always dream though); Jip’s wedding cake, agreeing afterwards. Of pair hired post-horses ready, Dora’s going away change her dress. Of aunt Miss Clarissa remaining us; walking garden; aunt, made quite speech breakfast touching Dora’s aunts, mightily amused herself, little proud too. Of Dora’s ready, Miss Lavinia’s hovering her, loth lose pretty toy given her much pleasant occupation. Of Dora’s making long series surprised discoveries she forgotten sorts little things; everybody’s running everywhere fetch them. Of closing Dora, last she begins say good-bye, looking, bright colours ribbons, like bed flowers. Of darling almost smothered among flowers, coming out, laughing crying together, jealous arms. Of wanting carry Jip (who go along us), Dora’s saying no, she must carry him, else he will think she do not like more, she married, break his heart. Of going, arm arm, Dora stopping looking back, saying, ‘If I ever cross ungrateful anybody, do not remember it!’ bursting tears. Of her waving her little hand, going away more. Of her stopping, looking back, hurrying Agnes, giving Agnes, others, her last kisses farewells. We drive away together, I awake dream. I believe last. It dear, dear, little wife beside me, I love well! ‘Are happy now, foolish boy?’ says Dora, ‘and sure do not repent?’ I stood aside see phantoms days go me. They gone, I resume journey story. CHAPTER 44. OUR HOUSEKEEPING It strange condition things, honeymoon over, bridesmaids gone home, I found sitting small house Dora; quite thrown employment, I may say, respect delicious old occupation making love. It seemed extraordinary thing Dora always there. It unaccountable obliged go see her, occasion tormenting her, write her, scheming devising opportunities alone her. Sometimes evening, I looked writing, saw her seated opposite, I would lean back chair, think queer were, alone together matter course--nobody’s business more--all romance engagement put away upon shelf, rust--no one please one another--one another please, life. When debate, I kept late, seemed strange me, I walking home, think Dora home! It wonderful thing, first, her coming softly talk I ate supper. It stupendous thing know certain she put her hair papers. It altogether astonishing event see her it! I doubt whether two young birds could known less keeping house, I pretty Dora did. We servant, course. She kept house us. I still latent belief she must Mrs. Crupp’s daughter disguise, awful time Mary Anne. Her name Paragon. Her nature represented us, engaged her, feebly expressed her name. She written character, large proclamation; and, according document, could everything domestic nature ever I heard of, great many things I never hear of. She woman prime life; severe countenance; subject (particularly arms) sort perpetual measles fiery rash. She cousin Life-Guards, long legs he looked like afternoon shadow somebody else. His she will-jacket much little he big premises. He made cottage smaller need been, much proportion it. Besides which, walls thick, and, whenever he passed evening house, always knew hearing one continual growl kitchen. Our treasure warranted sober honest. I therefore willing believe she fit found her boiler; deficient tea-spoons attributable dustman. But she preyed upon minds dreadfully. We felt inexperience, unable help ourselves. We her mercy, she any; she remorseless woman, none. She first little quarrel. ‘My dearest life,’ I said one day Dora, ‘do think Mary Anne idea time?’ ‘Why, Doady?’ inquired Dora, looking up, innocently, her drawing. ‘My love, it is five, dined four.’ Dora glanced wistfully clock, hinted she thought fast. ‘On contrary, love,’ said I, referring watch, ‘it is minutes slow.’ My little wife came sat upon knee, coax quiet, drew line her pencil middle nose; I could not dine that, though agreeable. ‘Do not think, dear,’ said I, ‘it would better remonstrate Mary Anne?’ ‘Oh no, please! I could not, Doady!’ said Dora. ‘Why not, love?’ I gently asked. ‘Oh, I little goose,’ said Dora, ‘and she knows I am!’ I thought sentiment incompatible establishment system check Mary Anne, I frowned little. ‘Oh, ugly wrinkles bad boy’s forehead!’ said Dora, still knee, she traced her pencil; putting her rosy lips make mark blacker, working forehead quaint little mockery industrious, quite delighted spite myself. ‘There is good child,’ said Dora, ‘it makes face much prettier laugh.’ ‘But, love,’ said I. ‘No, no! please!’ cried Dora, kiss, ‘do not naughty Blue Beard! Do not serious!’ ‘My precious wife,’ said I, ‘we must serious sometimes. Come! Sit chair, close beside me! Give pencil! There! Now let us talk sensibly. You know, dear’; little hand hold, tiny wedding-ring see! ‘You know, love, exactly comfortable go without one’s dinner. Now, it?’ ‘N-n-no!’ replied Dora, faintly. ‘My love, tremble!’ ‘Because I KNOW you are going scold me,’ exclaimed Dora, piteous voice. ‘My sweet, I going reason.’ ‘Oh, reasoning worse scolding!’ exclaimed Dora, despair. ‘I did not marry reasoned with. If meant reason poor little thing I am, ought told so, cruel boy!’ I tried pacify Dora, she turned away her face, shook her curls side side, said, ‘You cruel, cruel boy!’ many times, I really exactly know do: I took turns room uncertainty, came back again. ‘Dora, darling!’ ‘No, I darling. Because must sorry married me, else would not reason me!’ returned Dora. I felt injured inconsequential nature charge, gave courage grave. ‘Now, Dora,’ said I, ‘you childish, talking nonsense. You must remember, I sure, I obliged go yesterday dinner half over; that, day before, I made quite unwell obliged eat underdone veal hurry; today, I do not dine all--and I afraid say long waited breakfast--and water did not boil. I do not mean reproach you, dear, comfortable.’ ‘Oh, cruel, cruel boy, say I disagreeable wife!’ cried Dora. ‘Now, dear Dora, must know I never said that!’ ‘You said, I was not comfortable!’ cried Dora. ‘I said housekeeping comfortable!’ ‘It is exactly thing!’ cried Dora. And she evidently thought so, she wept grievously. I took another turn across room, full love pretty wife, distracted self-accusatory inclinations knock head door. I sat again, said: ‘I blaming you, Dora. We great deal learn. I trying show you, dear, must--you really must’ (I resolved give up)--‘accustom look Mary Anne. Likewise act little yourself, me.’ ‘I wonder, I do, making ungrateful speeches,’ sobbed Dora. ‘When know day, said would like little bit fish, I went myself, miles miles, ordered it, surprise you.’ ‘And kind you, darling,’ said I. ‘I felt much I would not account even mentioned bought Salmon--which much two. Or cost one pound six--which afford.’ ‘You enjoyed much,’ sobbed Dora. ‘And said I Mouse.’ ‘And I will say again, love,’ I returned, ‘a thousand times!’ But I wounded Dora’s soft little heart, she comforted. She pathetic her sobbing bewailing, I felt I said I do not know hurt her. I obliged hurry away; I kept late; I felt night pangs remorse made miserable. I conscience assassin, haunted vague sense enormous wickedness. It two three hours past midnight I got home. I found aunt, house, sitting me. ‘Is anything matter, aunt?’ said I, alarmed. ‘Nothing, Trot,’ she replied. ‘Sit down, sit down. Little Blossom rather spirits, I keeping her company. That is all.’ I leaned head upon hand; felt sorry downcast, I sat looking fire, I could supposed possible soon fulfilment brightest hopes. As I sat thinking, I happened meet aunt’s eyes, resting face. There anxious expression them, cleared directly. ‘I assure you, aunt,’ said I, ‘I quite unhappy night, think Dora’s so. But I intention speak her tenderly lovingly home-affairs.’ My aunt nodded encouragement. ‘You must patience, Trot,’ said she. ‘Of course. Heaven knows I do not mean unreasonable, aunt!’ ‘No, no,’ said aunt. ‘But Little Blossom tender little blossom, wind must gentle her.’ I thanked good aunt, heart, her tenderness towards wife; I sure she knew I did. ‘Do not think, aunt,’ said I, contemplation fire, ‘that could advise counsel Dora little, mutual advantage, then?’ ‘Trot,’ returned aunt, emotion, ‘no! Do not ask thing.’ Her tone earnest I raised eyes surprise. ‘I look back life, child,’ said aunt, ‘and I think graves, I might kinder terms. If I judged harshly people’s mistakes marriage, may I bitter reason judge harshly own. Let pass. I grumpy, frumpy, wayward sort woman, good many years. I still, I always shall be. But I done one another good, Trot,--at events, done good, dear; division must come us, time day.’ ‘Division us!’ cried I. ‘Child, child!’ said aunt, smoothing her dress, ‘how soon might come us, unhappy I might make Little Blossom, I meddled anything, prophet could not say. I want pet like me, gay butterfly. Remember home, second marriage; never her injury hinted at!’ I comprehended, once, aunt right; I comprehended full extent her generous feeling towards dear wife. ‘These early days, Trot,’ she pursued, ‘and Rome built day, year. You chosen freely yourself’; cloud passed her face moment, I thought; ‘and chosen pretty affectionate creature. It duty, pleasure too--of course I know that; I delivering lecture--to estimate her (as chose her) qualities she has, qualities she may have. The latter must develop her, can. And cannot, child,’ aunt rubbed her nose, ‘you must accustom without ‘them. But remember, dear, future two. No one assist you; work yourselves. This marriage, Trot; Heaven bless both, it, pair babes wood are!’ My aunt said sprightly way, gave kiss ratify blessing. ‘Now,’ said she, ‘light little lantern, see bandbox garden path’; communication cottages direction. ‘Give Betsey Trotwood’s love Blossom, come back; whatever do, Trot, never dream setting Betsey scarecrow, I ever saw her glass, she is quite grim enough gaunt enough her private capacity!’ With aunt tied her head handkerchief, she accustomed make bundle occasions; I escorted her home. As she stood her garden, holding her little lantern light back, I thought her observation anxious air again; I much occupied pondering she said, much impressed--for first time, reality--by conviction Dora I indeed work future ourselves, one could assist us, take much notice it. Dora came stealing her little slippers, meet me, I alone; cried upon shoulder, said I hard-hearted she naughty; I said much thing effect, I believe; made up, agreed first little difference last, never another lived hundred years. The next domestic trial went through, Ordeal Servants. Mary Anne’s cousin deserted coal-hole, brought out, great amazement, piquet his companions arms, took away handcuffed procession covered front-garden ignominy. This nerved get rid Mary Anne, went mildly, receipt wages, I surprised, I found tea-spoons, also little sums she borrowed name tradespeople without authority. After interval Mrs. Kidgerbury--the oldest inhabitant Kentish Town, I believe, went charing, feeble execute her conceptions art--we found another treasure, one amiable women, generally made point falling either kitchen stairs tray, almost plunged parlour, bath, tea-things. The ravages committed unfortunate, rendering her dismissal necessary, she succeeded (with intervals Mrs. Kidgerbury) long line Incapables; terminating young person genteel appearance, went Greenwich Fair Dora’s bonnet. After I remember nothing average equality failure. Everybody anything seemed cheat us. Our appearance shop signal damaged goods brought immediately. If bought lobster, full water. All meat turned tough, hardly crust loaves. In search principle joints ought roasted, roasted enough, much, I referred Cookery Book, found established allowance quarter hour every pound, say quarter over. But principle always failed us curious fatality, never could hit medium redness cinders. I reason believe accomplishing failures incurred far greater expense achieved series triumphs. It appeared me, looking tradesmen’s books, might kept basement storey paved butter, extensive scale consumption article. I do not know whether Excise returns period may exhibited increase demand pepper; performances affect market, I say several families must left using it. And wonderful fact was, never anything house. As washerwoman pawning clothes, coming state penitent intoxication apologize, I suppose might happened several times anybody. Also chimney fire, parish engine, perjury part Beadle. But I apprehend personally fortunate engaging servant taste cordials, swelled running account porter public-house inexplicable items ‘quartern rum shrub (Mrs. C.)’; ‘Half-quartern gin cloves (Mrs. C.)’; ‘Glass rum peppermint (Mrs. C.)’--the parentheses always referring Dora, supposed, appeared explanation, imbibed whole refreshments. One first feats housekeeping way little dinner Traddles. I met town, asked walk afternoon. He readily consenting, I wrote Dora, saying I would bring home. It pleasant weather, road made domestic happiness theme conversation. Traddles full it; said, that, picturing home, Sophy waiting preparing him, he could think nothing wanting complete his bliss. I could wished prettier little wife opposite end table, I certainly could wished, sat down, little room. I know was, though two us, always cramped room, yet always room enough lose everything in. I suspect may nothing place own, except Jip’s pagoda, invariably blocked main thoroughfare. On present occasion, Traddles hemmed pagoda guitar-case, Dora’s flower-painting, writing-table, I serious doubts possibility his using his knife fork; he protested, his good-humour, ‘Oceans room, Copperfield! I assure you, Oceans!’ There another thing I could wished, namely, Jip never encouraged walk tablecloth dinner. I began think something disorderly his all, even he habit putting his foot salt melted butter. On occasion he seemed think he introduced expressly keep Traddles bay; he barked old friend, made short runs his plate, undaunted pertinacity, he may said engrossed conversation. However, I knew tender-hearted dear Dora was, sensitive she would slight upon her favourite, I hinted objection. For similar reasons I made allusion skirmishing plates upon floor; disreputable appearance castors, sixes sevens, looked drunk; blockade Traddles wandering vegetable dishes jugs. I could help wondering mind, I contemplated boiled leg mutton me, previous carving it, came pass joints meat extraordinary shapes--and whether butcher contracted deformed sheep came world; I kept reflections myself. ‘My love,’ said I Dora, ‘what got dish?’ I could imagine Dora making tempting little faces me, she wanted kiss me. ‘Oysters, dear,’ said Dora, timidly. ‘Was YOUR thought?’ said I, delighted. ‘Ye-yes, Doady,’ said Dora. ‘There never happier one!’ I exclaimed, laying carving-knife fork. ‘There nothing Traddles likes much!’ ‘Ye-yes, Doady,’ said Dora, ‘and I bought beautiful little barrel them, man said good. But I--I afraid there is something matter them. They do not seem right.’ Here Dora shook her head, diamonds twinkled her eyes. ‘They opened shells,’ said I. ‘Take top one off, love.’ ‘But will not come off!’ said Dora, trying hard, looking much distressed. ‘Do know, Copperfield,’ said Traddles, cheerfully examining dish, ‘I think consequence--they capital oysters, I think consequence--of never opened.’ They never opened; oyster-knives--and could not used had; looked oysters ate mutton. At least ate much done, made capers. If I permitted him, I satisfied Traddles would made perfect savage himself, eaten plateful raw meat, express enjoyment repast; I would hear immolation altar friendship, course bacon instead; happening, good fortune, cold bacon larder. My poor little wife affliction she thought I annoyed, state joy she found I not, discomfiture I subdued, soon vanished, passed happy evening; Dora sitting her arm chair Traddles I discussed glass wine, taking every opportunity whispering ear good cruel, cross old boy. By she made tea us; pretty see her do, she busying herself set doll’s tea-things, I particular quality beverage. Then Traddles I played game two cribbage; Dora singing guitar while, seemed courtship marriage tender dream mine, night I first listened her voice yet over. When Traddles went away, I came back parlour seeing out, wife planted her chair close mine, sat side. ‘I sorry,’ she said. ‘Will try teach me, Doady?’ ‘I must teach first, Dora,’ said I. ‘I bad you, love.’ ‘Ah! But learn,’ she returned; ‘and clever, clever man!’ ‘Nonsense, mouse!’ said I. ‘I wish,’ resumed wife, long silence, ‘that I could gone country whole year, lived Agnes!’ Her hands clasped upon shoulder, her chin rested them, her blue eyes looked quietly mine. ‘Why so?’ I asked. ‘I think she might improved me, I think I might learned her,’ said Dora. ‘All good time, love. Agnes her father take care many years, remember. Even she quite child, she Agnes know,’ said I. ‘Will call name I want call me?’ inquired Dora, without moving. ‘What it?’ I asked smile. ‘It is stupid name,’ she said, shaking her curls moment. ‘Child-wife.’ I laughingly asked child-wife her fancy desiring called. She answered without moving, otherwise arm I twined her may brought her blue eyes nearer me: ‘I do not mean, silly fellow, use name instead Dora. I mean think way. When going angry me, say yourself, “it is child-wife!” When I disappointing, say, “I knew, long time ago, she would make child-wife!” When miss I like be, I think never be, say, “still foolish child-wife loves me!” For indeed I do.’ I serious her; idea now, she serious herself. But her affectionate nature happy I said her whole heart, her face became laughing one her glittering eyes dry. She soon child-wife indeed; sitting floor outside Chinese House, ringing little bells one another, punish Jip his recent bad behaviour; Jip lay blinking doorway his head out, even lazy teased. This appeal Dora’s made strong impression me. I look back time I write of; I invoke innocent figure I dearly loved, come mists shadows past, turn gentle head towards again; I still declare one little speech constantly memory. I may used best account; I young inexperienced; I never turned deaf ear artless pleading. Dora told me, shortly afterwards, she going wonderful housekeeper. Accordingly, she polished tablets, pointed pencil, bought immense account-book, carefully stitched needle thread leaves Cookery Book Jip torn, made quite desperate little attempt ‘to good’, she called it. But figures old obstinate propensity--they WOULD NOT add up. When she entered two three laborious items account-book, Jip would walk page, wagging his tail, smear out. Her little right-hand middle finger got steeped bone ink; I think decided result obtained. Sometimes, evening, I home work--for I wrote good deal now, beginning small way known writer--I would lay pen, watch child-wife trying good. First all, she would bring immense account-book, lay upon table, deep sigh. Then she would open place Jip made illegible last night, call Jip up, look his misdeeds. This would occasion diversion Jip’s favour, inking his nose, perhaps, penalty. Then she would tell Jip lie table instantly, ‘like lion’--which one his tricks, though I cannot say likeness striking--and, he obedient humour, he would obey. Then she would take pen, begin write, find hair it. Then she would take another pen, begin write, find spluttered. Then she would take another pen, begin write, say low voice, ‘Oh, it is talking pen, disturb Doady!’ And she would give bad job, put account-book away, pretending crush lion it. Or, she sedate serious state mind, she would sit tablets, little basket bills documents, looked like curl-papers anything else, endeavour get result them. After severely comparing one another, making entries tablets, blotting out, counting fingers her left hand again, backwards forwards, she would vexed discouraged, would look unhappy, gave pain see her bright face clouded--and me!--and I would go softly her, say: ‘What is matter, Dora?’ Dora would look hopelessly, reply, ‘They will not come right. They make head ache so. And will not anything I want!’ Then I would say, ‘Now let us try together. Let show you, Dora.’ Then I would commence practical demonstration, Dora would pay profound attention, perhaps five minutes; she would begin dreadfully tired, would lighten subject curling hair, trying effect face shirt-collar turned down. If I tacitly checked playfulness, persisted, she would look scared disconsolate, she became bewildered, remembrance her natural gaiety I first strayed her path, her child-wife, would come reproachfully upon me; I would lay pencil down, call guitar. I great deal work do, many anxieties, considerations made keep myself. I far sure, now, right this, I child-wife’s sake. I search breast, I commit secrets, I know them, without reservation paper. The old unhappy loss want something had, I conscious, place heart; embitterment life. When I walked alone fine weather, thought summer days air filled boyish enchantment, I miss something realization dreams; I thought softened glory Past, nothing could thrown upon present time. I feel, sometimes, little while, I could wished wife counsellor; character purpose, sustain improve by; endowed power fill void somewhere seemed me; I felt unearthly consummation happiness, never meant be, never could been. I boyish husband years. I known softening influence sorrows experiences recorded leaves. If I wrong, I may done much, I mistaken love, want wisdom. I write exact truth. It would avail nothing extenuate now. Thus I took upon toils cares life, partner them. We lived much before, reference scrambling household arrangements; I got used those, Dora I pleased see seldom vexed now. She bright cheerful old childish way, loved dearly, happy her old trifles. When debates heavy--I mean length, quality, last respect often otherwise--and I went home late, Dora would never rest she heard footsteps, would always come downstairs meet me. When evenings unoccupied pursuit I qualified much pains, I engaged writing home, she would sit quietly near me, however late hour, mute, I would often think she dropped asleep. But generally, I raised head, I saw her blue eyes looking quiet attention I already spoken. ‘Oh, weary boy!’ said Dora one night, I met her eyes I shutting desk. ‘What weary girl!’ said I. ‘That is purpose. You must go bed another time, love. It is far late you.’ ‘No, do not send bed!’ pleaded Dora, coming side. ‘Pray, do not that!’ ‘Dora!’ To amazement she sobbing neck. ‘Not well, dear! happy!’ ‘Yes! quite well, happy!’ said Dora. ‘But say you will let stop, see write.’ ‘Why, sight bright eyes midnight!’ I replied. ‘Are bright, though?’ returned Dora, laughing. ‘I am glad they are bright.’ ‘Little Vanity!’ said I. But vanity; harmless delight admiration. I knew well, she told so. ‘If think pretty, say I may always stop, see write!’ said Dora. ‘Do think pretty?’ ‘Very pretty.’ ‘Then let always stop see write.’ ‘I afraid will not improve brightness, Dora.’ ‘Yes, will! Because, clever boy, you will forget then, full silent fancies. Will mind it, I say something very, silly?---more usual?’ inquired Dora, peeping shoulder face. ‘What wonderful thing that?’ said I. ‘Please let hold pens,’ said Dora. ‘I want something many hours industrious. May I hold pens?’ The remembrance her pretty joy I said yes, brings tears eyes. The next time I sat write, regularly afterwards, she sat her old place, spare bundle pens her side. Her triumph connexion work, her delight I wanted new pen--which I often feigned do--suggested new way pleasing child-wife. I occasionally made pretence wanting page two manuscript copied. Then Dora her glory. The preparations she made great work, aprons she put on, bibs she borrowed kitchen keep ink, time she took, innumerable stoppages she made laugh Jip he understood all, her conviction her work incomplete unless she signed her name end, way she would bring me, like school-copy, then, I praised it, clasp round neck, touching recollections me, simple might appear men. She took possession keys soon this, went jingling house whole bunch little basket, tied her slender waist. I seldom found places belonged locked, use except plaything Jip--but Dora pleased, pleased me. She quite satisfied good deal effected make-belief housekeeping; merry keeping baby-house, joke. So went on. Dora hardly less affectionate aunt me, often told her time she afraid she ‘a cross old thing’. I never saw aunt unbend systematically anyone. She courted Jip, though Jip never responded; listened, day day, guitar, though I afraid she taste music; never attacked Incapables, though temptation must severe; went wonderful distances foot purchase, surprises, trifles she found Dora wanted; never came garden, missed her room, she would call out, foot stairs, voice sounded cheerfully house: ‘Where is Little Blossom?’ CHAPTER 45. MR. DICK FULFILS MY AUNT’S PREDICTIONS It time now, since I left Doctor. Living his neighbourhood, I saw frequently; went his house two three occasions dinner tea. The Old Soldier permanent quarters Doctor’s roof. She exactly ever, immortal butterflies hovered her cap. Like mothers, I known course life, Mrs. Markleham far fond pleasure her daughter was. She required great deal amusement, and, like deep old soldier, pretended, consulting her inclinations, devoting herself her child. The Doctor’s desire Annie entertained, therefore particularly acceptable excellent parent; expressed unqualified approval his discretion. I doubt, indeed, she probed Doctor’s wound without knowing it. Meaning nothing certain matured frivolity selfishness, always inseparable full-blown years, I think she confirmed his fear he constraint upon his young wife, congeniality feeling them, strongly commending his design lightening load her life. ‘My dear soul,’ she said one day I present, ‘you know doubt would little pokey Annie always shut here.’ The Doctor nodded his benevolent head. ‘When she comes her mother’s age,’ said Mrs. Markleham, flourish her fan, ‘then it will another thing. You might put ME Jail, genteel society rubber, I never care come out. But I Annie, know; Annie her mother.’ ‘Surely, surely,’ said Doctor. ‘You best creatures--no, I beg pardon!’ Doctor made gesture deprecation, ‘I must say face, I always say behind back, best creatures; course do not--now you?---enter pursuits fancies Annie?’ ‘No,’ said Doctor, sorrowful tone. ‘No, course not,’ retorted Old Soldier. ‘Take Dictionary, example. What useful work Dictionary is! What necessary work! The meanings words! Without Doctor Johnson, somebody sort, might present moment calling Italian-iron, bedstead. But cannot expect Dictionary--especially it is making--to interest Annie, we?’ The Doctor shook his head. ‘And that is I much approve,’ said Mrs. Markleham, tapping shoulder her shut-up fan, ‘of thoughtfulness. It shows do not expect, many elderly people expect, old heads young shoulders. You studied Annie’s character, understand it. That is I find charming!’ Even calm patient face Doctor Strong expressed little sense pain, I thought, infliction compliments. ‘Therefore, dear Doctor,’ said Old Soldier, giving several affectionate taps, ‘you may command me, times seasons. Now, understand I entirely service. I ready go Annie operas, concerts, exhibitions, kinds places; shall never find I tired. Duty, dear Doctor, every consideration universe!’ She good her word. She one people bear great deal pleasure, she never flinched her perseverance because. She seldom got hold newspaper (which she settled herself softest chair house read eye-glass, every day, two hours), she found something she certain Annie would like see. It vain Annie protest she weary things. Her mother’s remonstrance always was, ‘Now, dear Annie, I sure know better; I must tell you, love, making proper return kindness Doctor Strong.’ This usually said Doctor’s presence, appeared constitute Annie’s principal inducement withdrawing her objections she made any. But general she resigned herself her mother, went Old Soldier would. It rarely happened Mr. Maldon accompanied them. Sometimes aunt Dora invited so, accepted invitation. Sometimes Dora asked. The time been, I uneasy her going; reflection passed former night Doctor’s study, made change mistrust. I believed Doctor right, I worse suspicions. My aunt rubbed her nose sometimes she happened alone me, said she could not make out; she wished happier; she did not think military friend (so she always called Old Soldier) mended matter all. My aunt expressed her opinion, ‘that military friend would cut butterflies, give ‘them chimney-sweepers May-day, would look like beginning something sensible her part.’ But her abiding reliance Mr. Dick. That man evidently idea his head, she said; he could pen corner, his great difficulty, he would distinguish extraordinary manner. Unconscious prediction, Mr. Dick continued occupy precisely ground reference Doctor Mrs. Strong. He seemed neither advance recede. He appeared settled his original foundation, like building; I must confess faith his ever Moving, much greater he building. But one night, I married months, Mr. Dick put his head parlour, I writing alone (Dora gone aunt take tea two little birds), said, significant cough: ‘You could not speak without inconveniencing yourself, Trotwood, I afraid?’ ‘Certainly, Mr. Dick,’ said I; ‘come in!’ ‘Trotwood,’ said Mr. Dick, laying his finger side his nose, he shaken hands me. ‘Before I sit down, I wish make observation. You know aunt?’ ‘A little,’ I replied. ‘She wonderful woman world, sir!’ After delivery communication, he shot he loaded it, Mr. Dick sat greater gravity usual, looked me. ‘Now, boy,’ said Mr. Dick, ‘I going put question you.’ ‘As many please,’ said I. ‘What consider me, sir?’ asked Mr. Dick, folding his arms. ‘A dear old friend,’ said I. ‘Thank you, Trotwood,’ returned Mr. Dick, laughing, reaching across high glee shake hands me. ‘But I mean, boy,’ resuming his gravity, ‘what consider respect?’ touching his forehead. I puzzled answer, he helped word. ‘Weak?’ said Mr. Dick. ‘Well,’ I replied, dubiously. ‘Rather so.’ ‘Exactly!’ cried Mr. Dick, seemed quite enchanted reply. ‘That is, Trotwood, took trouble you-know-who is head, put know where, a--’ Mr. Dick made his two hands revolve fast great number times, brought collision, rolled one another, express confusion. ‘There sort thing done somehow. Eh?’ I nodded him, he nodded back again. ‘In short, boy,’ said Mr. Dick, dropping his voice whisper, ‘I simple.’ I would qualified conclusion, he stopped me. ‘Yes, I am! She pretends I not. She will not hear it; I am. I know I am. If she had not stood friend, sir, I shut up, lead dismal life many years. But I will provide her! I never spend copying money. I put box. I made will. I will leave her. She shall rich--noble!’ Mr. Dick took his pocket-handkerchief, wiped his eyes. He folded great care, pressed smooth his two hands, put his pocket, seemed put aunt away it. ‘Now scholar, Trotwood,’ said Mr. Dick. ‘You fine scholar. You know learned man, great man, Doctor is. You know honour he always done me. Not proud his wisdom. Humble, humble--condescending even poor Dick, simple knows nothing. I sent his name up, scrap paper, kite, along string, sky, among larks. The kite glad receive it, sir, sky brighter it.’ I delighted saying, heartily, Doctor deserving best respect highest esteem. ‘And his beautiful wife star,’ said Mr. Dick. ‘A shining star. I seen her shine, sir. But,’ bringing his chair nearer, laying one hand upon knee--‘clouds, sir--clouds.’ I answered solicitude his face expressed, conveying expression own, shaking head. ‘What clouds?’ said Mr. Dick. He looked wistfully face, anxious understand, I took great pains answer slowly distinctly, I might entered explanation child. ‘There unfortunate division them,’ I replied. ‘Some unhappy separation. A secret. It may inseparable discrepancy years. It may grown almost nothing.’ Mr. Dick, told every sentence thoughtful nod, paused I done, sat considering, his eyes upon face, his hand upon knee. ‘Doctor angry her, Trotwood?’ he said, time. ‘No. Devoted her.’ ‘Then, I got it, boy!’ said Mr. Dick. The sudden exultation he slapped knee, leaned back his chair, his eyebrows lifted high he could possibly lift them, made think farther his wits ever. He became suddenly grave again, leaning forward before, said--first respectfully taking his pocket-handkerchief, really represent aunt: ‘Most wonderful woman world, Trotwood. Why she done nothing set things right?’ ‘Too delicate difficult subject interference,’ I replied. ‘Fine scholar,’ said Mr. Dick, touching his finger. ‘Why HE done nothing?’ ‘For reason,’ I returned. ‘Then, I got it, boy!’ said Mr. Dick. And he stood me, exultingly before, nodding his head, striking repeatedly upon breast, one might supposed he nearly nodded struck breath his body. ‘A poor fellow craze, sir,’ said Mr. Dick, ‘a simpleton, weak-minded person--present company, know!’ striking again, ‘may wonderful people may do. I will bring together, boy. I will try. They will blame me. They will object me. They will mind I do, it is wrong. I am Mr. Dick. And minds Dick? Dick’s nobody! Whoo!’ He blew slight, contemptuous breath, he blew away. It fortunate he proceeded far his mystery, heard coach stop little garden gate, brought aunt Dora home. ‘Not word, boy!’ he pursued whisper; ‘leave blame Dick--simple Dick--mad Dick. I thinking, sir, time, I getting it, I got it. After said me, I sure I got it. All right!’ Not another word Mr. Dick utter subject; he made telegraph next half-hour (to great disturbance aunt’s mind), enjoin inviolable secrecy me. To surprise, I heard two three weeks, though I sufficiently interested result his endeavours; descrying strange gleam good sense--I say nothing good feeling, he always exhibited--in conclusion he come. At last I began believe, that, flighty unsettled state his mind, he either forgotten his intention abandoned it. One fair evening, Dora inclined go out, aunt I strolled Doctor’s cottage. It autumn, debates vex evening air; I remember leaves smelt like garden Blunderstone trod foot, old, unhappy feeling, seemed go by, sighing wind. It twilight reached cottage. Mrs. Strong coming garden, Mr. Dick yet lingered, busy his knife, helping gardener point stakes. The Doctor engaged someone his study; visitor would gone directly, Mrs. Strong said, begged us remain see him. We went drawing-room her, sat darkening window. There never ceremony visits old friends neighbours were. We sat many minutes, Mrs. Markleham, usually contrived fuss something, came bustling in, her newspaper her hand, said, breath, ‘My goodness gracious, Annie, did not tell someone Study!’ ‘My dear mama,’ she quietly returned, ‘how could I know desired information?’ ‘Desired information!’ said Mrs. Markleham, sinking sofa. ‘I never turn life!’ ‘Have Study, then, mama?’ asked Annie. ‘BEEN Study, dear!’ she returned emphatically. ‘Indeed I have! I came upon amiable creature--if you will imagine feelings, Miss Trotwood David--in act making his will.’ Her daughter looked round window quickly. ‘In act, dear Annie,’ repeated Mrs. Markleham, spreading newspaper her lap like table-cloth, patting her hands upon it, ‘of making his last Will Testament. The foresight affection dear! I must tell was. I really must, justice darling--for he nothing less!--tell was. Perhaps know, Miss Trotwood, never candle lighted house, one’s eyes literally falling one’s head stretched read paper. And chair house, paper I call, read, except one Study. This took Study, I saw light. I opened door. In company dear Doctor two professional people, evidently connected law, three standing table: darling Doctor pen hand. “This simply expresses then,” said Doctor--Annie, love, attend words--“this simply expresses then, gentlemen, confidence I Mrs. Strong, gives her unconditionally?” One professional people replied, “And gives her unconditionally.” Upon that, natural feelings mother, I said, “Good God, I beg pardon!” fell door-step, came away little back passage pantry is.’ Mrs. Strong opened window, went verandah, she stood leaning pillar. ‘But is not it, Miss Trotwood, is not it, David, invigorating,’ said Mrs. Markleham, mechanically following her her eyes, ‘to find man Doctor Strong’s time life, strength mind kind thing? It shows right I was. I said Annie, Doctor Strong paid flattering visit myself, made her subject declaration offer, I said, “My dear, doubt whatever, opinion, reference suitable provision you, Doctor Strong he binds do.”’ Here bell rang, heard sound visitors’ feet went out. ‘It is over, doubt,’ said Old Soldier, listening; ‘the dear creature signed, sealed, delivered, his mind’s rest. Well may be! What mind! Annie, love, I going Study paper, I poor creature without news. Miss Trotwood, David, pray come see Doctor.’ I conscious Mr. Dick’s standing shadow room, shutting his knife, accompanied her Study; aunt’s rubbing her nose violently, way, mild vent her intolerance military friend; got first Study, Mrs. Markleham settled herself moment her easy-chair, aunt I came left together near door (unless her eyes quicker mine, she held back), I forgotten, I ever knew. But I know,--that saw Doctor he saw us, sitting his table, among folio volumes he delighted, resting his head calmly his hand. That, moment, saw Mrs. Strong glide in, pale trembling. That Mr. Dick supported her his arm. That he laid his hand upon Doctor’s arm, causing look abstracted air. That, Doctor moved his head, his wife dropped one knee his feet, and, her hands imploringly lifted, fixed upon his face memorable look I never forgotten. That sight Mrs. Markleham dropped newspaper, stared like figure-head intended ship called The Astonishment, anything else I think of. The gentleness Doctor’s manner surprise, dignity mingled supplicating attitude his wife, amiable concern Mr. Dick, earnestness aunt said herself, ‘That man mad!’ (triumphantly expressive misery she saved him)--I see hear, rather remember, I write it. ‘Doctor!’ said Mr. Dick. ‘What that is amiss? Look here!’ ‘Annie!’ cried Doctor. ‘Not feet, dear!’ ‘Yes!’ she said. ‘I beg pray one leave room! Oh, husband father, break long silence. Let us know come us!’ Mrs. Markleham, time recovering power speech, seeming swell family pride motherly indignation, exclaimed, ‘Annie, get immediately, do not disgrace everybody belonging humbling like that, unless wish see go mind spot!’ ‘Mama!’ returned Annie. ‘Waste words me, appeal husband, even nothing here.’ ‘Nothing!’ exclaimed Mrs. Markleham. ‘Me, nothing! The child taken leave her senses. Please get glass water!’ I attentive Doctor his wife, give heed request; made impression anybody else; Mrs. Markleham panted, stared, fanned herself. ‘Annie!’ said Doctor, tenderly taking her his hands. ‘My dear! If unavoidable change come, sequence time, upon married life, blame. The fault mine, mine. There change affection, admiration, respect. I wish make happy. I truly love honour you. Rise, Annie, pray!’ But she rise. After looking little while, she sank closer him, laid her arm across his knee, dropping her head upon it, said: ‘If I friend here, speak one word me, husband matter; I friend here, give voice suspicion heart sometimes whispered me; I friend here, honours husband, ever cared me, anything within his knowledge, matter is, may help mediate us, I implore friend speak!’ There profound silence. After moments painful hesitation, I broke silence. ‘Mrs. Strong,’ I said, ‘there something within knowledge, I earnestly entreated Doctor Strong conceal, concealed tonight. But, I believe time come would mistaken faith delicacy conceal longer, appeal absolves his injunction.’ She turned her face towards moment, I knew I right. I could resisted entreaty, assurance gave less convincing. ‘Our future peace,’ she said, ‘may hands. I trust confidently suppressing anything. I know beforehand nothing you, anyone, tell me, show husband’s noble heart light one. Howsoever may seem touch me, disregard that. I speak myself, him, God afterwards.’ Thus earnestly besought, I made reference Doctor his permission, but, without compromise truth little softening coarseness Uriah Heep, related plainly passed room night. The staring Mrs. Markleham whole narration, shrill, sharp interjections she occasionally interrupted it, defy description. When I finished, Annie remained, moments, silent, her head bent down, I described. Then, she took Doctor’s hand (he sitting attitude entered room), pressed her breast, kissed it. Mr. Dick softly raised her; she stood, she began speak, leaning him, looking upon her husband--from she never turned her eyes. ‘All ever mind, since I married,’ she said low, submissive, tender voice, ‘I lay bare you. I could live one reservation, knowing I know now.’ ‘Nay, Annie,’ said Doctor, mildly, ‘I never doubted you, child. There need; indeed need, dear.’ ‘There great need,’ she answered, way, ‘that I open whole heart soul generosity truth, whom, year year, day day, I loved venerated more, Heaven knows!’ ‘Really,’ interrupted Mrs. Markleham, ‘if I discretion all--’ [‘Which have not, Marplot,’ observed aunt, indignant whisper.) --‘I must permitted observe cannot requisite enter details.’ ‘No one husband judge that, mama,’ said Annie without removing her eyes his face, ‘and he hear me. If I say anything give pain, mama, forgive me. I borne pain first, often long, myself.’ ‘Upon word!’ gasped Mrs. Markleham. ‘When I young,’ said Annie, ‘quite little child, first associations knowledge kind inseparable patient friend teacher--the friend dead father--who always dear me. I remember nothing I know, without remembering him. He stored mind first treasures, stamped his character upon all. They never could been, I think, good me, I taken hands.’ ‘Makes her mother nothing!’ exclaimed Mrs. Markleham. ‘Not mama,’ said Annie; ‘but I make he was. I must that. As I grew up, he occupied place still. I proud his interest: deeply, fondly, gratefully attached him. I looked him, I hardly describe how--as father, guide, one whose praise different praise, one I could trusted confided, I doubted world. You know, mama, young inexperienced I was, presented me, sudden, lover.’ ‘I mentioned fact, fifty times least, everybody here!’ said Mrs. Markleham. [‘Then hold tongue, Lord’s sake, do not mention more!’ muttered aunt.) ‘It great change: great loss, I felt it, first,’ said Annie, still preserving look tone, ‘that I agitated distressed. I girl; great change came character I long looked him, I think I sorry. But nothing could made he used again; I proud he think worthy, married.’ ‘--At Saint Alphage, Canterbury,’ observed Mrs. Markleham. [‘Confound woman!’ said aunt, ‘she WILL NOT quiet!’) ‘I never thought,’ proceeded Annie, heightened colour, ‘of worldly gain husband would bring me. My young heart room homage poor reference. Mama, forgive I say first presented mind thought anyone could wrong me, wrong him, cruel suspicion.’ ‘Me!’ cried Mrs. Markleham. [‘Ah! You, sure!’ observed aunt, ‘and cannot fan away, military friend!’) ‘It first unhappiness new life,’ said Annie. ‘It first occasion every unhappy moment I known. These moments more, late, I count; not--my generous husband!--not reason suppose; heart thought, recollection, hope, power could separate you!’ She raised her eyes, clasped her hands, looked beautiful true, I thought, Spirit. The Doctor looked her, henceforth, steadfastly she him. ‘Mama blameless,’ she went on, ‘of ever urged herself, she blameless intention every way, I sure,--but I saw many importunate claims pressed upon name; traded name; generous were, Mr. Wickfield, welfare much heart, resented it; first sense exposure mean suspicion tenderness bought--and sold you, men earth--fell upon like unmerited disgrace, I forced participate. I cannot tell was--mama cannot imagine was--to dread trouble always mind, yet know soul marriage-day I crowned love honour life!’ ‘A specimen thanks one gets,’ cried Mrs. Markleham, tears, ‘for taking care one’s family! I wish I Turk!’ [‘I wish were, heart--and native country!’ said aunt.) ‘It time mama solicitous Cousin Maldon. I liked him’: she spoke softly, without hesitation: ‘very much. We little lovers once. If circumstances happened otherwise, I might come persuade I really loved him, might married him, wretched. There disparity marriage like unsuitability mind purpose.’ I pondered words, even I studiously attending followed, particular interest, strange application I could divine. ‘There disparity marriage like unsuitability mind purpose’--‘no disparity marriage like unsuitability mind purpose.’ ‘There nothing,’ said Annie, ‘that common. I long found nothing. If I thankful husband more, instead much, I thankful saved first mistaken impulse undisciplined heart.’ She stood quite still, Doctor, spoke earnestness thrilled me. Yet her voice quiet before. ‘When he waiting object munificence, freely bestowed sake, I unhappy mercenary shape I made wear, I thought would become better worked his way on. I thought I he, I would tried it, cost almost hardship. But I thought worse him, night his departure India. That night I knew he false thankless heart. I saw double meaning, then, Mr. Wickfield’s scrutiny me. I perceived, first time, dark suspicion shadowed life.’ ‘Suspicion, Annie!’ said Doctor. ‘No, no, no!’ ‘In mind none, I know, husband!’ she returned. ‘And I came you, night, lay load shame grief, knew I tell that, underneath roof, one kindred, benefactor, love me, spoken words found utterance, even I weak mercenary wretch he thought me--my mind revolted taint tale conveyed. It died upon lips, hour till never passed them.’ Mrs. Markleham, short groan, leaned back her easy-chair; retired behind her fan, she never coming more. ‘I never, presence, interchanged word time; then, necessary avoidance explanation. Years passed since he knew, me, his situation was. The kindnesses secretly done his advancement, disclosed me, surprise pleasure, been, believe, aggravations unhappiness burden secret.’ She sunk gently Doctor’s feet, though he his utmost prevent her; said, looking up, tearfully, his face: ‘Do speak yet! Let say little more! Right wrong, done again, I think I same. You never know devoted you, old associations; find anyone could hard suppose truth heart bartered away, surrounded appearances confirming belief. I young, adviser. Between mama me, relating you, wide division. If I shrunk myself, hiding disrespect I undergone, I honoured much, much wished honour me!’ ‘Annie, pure heart!’ said Doctor, ‘my dear girl!’ ‘A little more! words more! I used think many might married, would brought charge trouble you, would made home worthier home. I used afraid I better remained pupil, almost child. I used fear I unsuited learning wisdom. If made shrink within (as indeed did), I tell, still I honoured much, hoped might one day honour me.’ ‘That day shone long time, Annie,’ said Doctor, ‘and one long night, dear.’ ‘Another word! I afterwards meant--steadfastly meant, purposed myself--to bear whole weight knowing unworthiness one good. And last word, dearest best friends! The late change you, I seen much pain sorrow, sometimes referred old apprehension--at times lingering suppositions nearer truth--has made clear tonight; accident I also come know, tonight, full measure noble trust me, even mistake. I hope love duty I may render return, ever make worthy priceless confidence; knowledge fresh upon me, I lift eyes dear face, revered father’s, loved husband’s, sacred childhood friend’s, solemnly declare lightest thought I never wronged you; never wavered love fidelity I owe you!’ She her arms around Doctor’s neck, he leant his head her, mingling his grey hair her dark brown tresses. ‘Oh, hold heart, husband! Never cast out! Do think speak disparity us, none, except many imperfections. Every succeeding year I known better, I esteemed more. Oh, take heart, husband, love founded rock, endures!’ In silence ensued, aunt walked gravely Mr. Dick, without hurrying herself, gave hug sounding kiss. And fortunate, view his credit, she so; I confident I detected moment act making preparations stand one leg, appropriate expression delight. ‘You remarkable man, Dick!’ said aunt, air unqualified approbation; ‘and never pretend anything else, I know better!’ With that, aunt pulled sleeve, nodded me; three stole quietly room, came away. ‘That is settler military friend, rate,’ said aunt, way home. ‘I sleep better that, nothing else glad of!’ ‘She quite overcome, I afraid,’ said Mr. Dick, great commiseration. ‘What! Did ever see crocodile overcome?’ inquired aunt. ‘I do not think I ever saw crocodile,’ returned Mr. Dick, mildly. ‘There never would anything matter, had not old Animal,’ said aunt, strong emphasis. ‘It is much wished mothers would leave daughters alone marriage, violently affectionate. They seem think return made bringing unfortunate young woman world--God bless soul, she asked brought, wanted come!--is full liberty worry her again. What thinking of, Trot?’ I thinking said. My mind still running expressions used. ‘There disparity marriage like unsuitability mind purpose.’ ‘The first mistaken impulse undisciplined heart.’ ‘My love founded rock.’ But home; trodden leaves lying under-foot, autumn wind blowing. CHAPTER 46. INTELLIGENCE I must married, I may trust imperfect memory dates, year so, one evening, I returning solitary walk, thinking book I writing--for success steadily increased steady application, I engaged time upon first work fiction--I came past Mrs. Steerforth’s house. I often passed before, residence neighbourhood, though never I could choose another road. Howbeit, sometimes happen easy find another, without making long circuit; I passed way, upon whole, pretty often. I never done glance house, I went quickened step. It uniformly gloomy dull. None best rooms abutted road; narrow, heavily-framed old-fashioned windows, never cheerful circumstances, looked dismal, close shut, blinds always drawn down. There covered way across little paved court, entrance never used; one round staircase window, odds rest, one unshaded blind, unoccupied blank look. I remember I ever saw light house. If I casual passer-by, I probably supposed childless person lay dead it. If I happily possessed knowledge place, seen often changeless state, I pleased fancy many ingenious speculations, I dare say. As was, I thought little I might. But mind could go leave it, body did; usually awakened long train meditations. Coming me, particular evening I mention, mingled childish recollections later fancies, ghosts half-formed hopes, broken shadows disappointments dimly seen understood, blending experience imagination, incidental occupation thoughts busy, commonly suggestive. I fell brown study I walked on, voice side made start. It woman’s voice, too. I long recollecting Mrs. Steerforth’s little parlour-maid, formerly worn blue ribbons her cap. She taken now, adapt herself, I suppose, altered character house; wore one two disconsolate bows sober brown. ‘If please, sir, would goodness walk in, speak Miss Dartle?’ ‘Has Miss Dartle sent me?’ I inquired. ‘Not tonight, sir, it is same. Miss Dartle saw pass night two ago; I sit work staircase, I saw pass again, ask step speak her.’ I turned back, inquired conductor, went along, Mrs. Steerforth was. She said her lady poorly, kept her room good deal. When arrived house, I directed Miss Dartle garden, left make presence known her myself. She sitting seat one end kind terrace, overlooking great city. It sombre evening, lurid light sky; I saw prospect scowling distance, larger object starting sullen glare, I fancied inapt companion memory fierce woman. She saw I advanced, rose moment receive me. I thought her, then, still colourless thin I seen her last; flashing eyes still brighter, scar still plainer. Our meeting cordial. We parted angrily last occasion; air disdain her, she took pains conceal. ‘I told wish speak me, Miss Dartle,’ said I, standing near her, hand upon back seat, declining her gesture invitation sit down. ‘If please,’ said she. ‘Pray girl found?’ ‘No.’ ‘And yet she run away!’ I saw her thin lips working she looked me, eager load her reproaches. ‘Run away?’ I repeated. ‘Yes! From him,’ she said, laugh. ‘If she found, perhaps she never found. She may dead!’ The vaunting cruelty she met glance, I never saw expressed face ever I seen. ‘To wish her dead,’ said I, ‘may kindest wish one her sex could bestow upon her. I glad time softened much, Miss Dartle.’ She condescended make reply, but, turning another scornful laugh, said: ‘The friends excellent much-injured young lady friends yours. You champion, assert rights. Do wish know known her?’ ‘Yes,’ said I. She rose ill-favoured smile, taking steps towards wall holly near hand, dividing lawn kitchen-garden, said, louder voice, ‘Come here!’--as she calling unclean beast. ‘You restrain demonstrative championship vengeance place, course, Mr. Copperfield?’ said she, looking her shoulder expression. I inclined head, without knowing she meant; she said, ‘Come here!’ again; returned, followed respectable Mr. Littimer, who, undiminished respectability, made bow, took his position behind her. The air wicked grace: triumph, which, strange say, yet something feminine alluring: she reclined upon seat us, looked me, worthy cruel Princess Legend. ‘Now,’ said she, imperiously, without glancing him, touching old wound throbbed: perhaps, instance, pleasure rather pain. ‘Tell Mr. Copperfield flight.’ ‘Mr. James myself, madam--’ ‘Do not address me!’ she interrupted frown. ‘Mr. James myself, sir--’ ‘Nor me, please,’ said I. Mr. Littimer, without discomposed, signified slight obeisance, anything agreeable us agreeable him; began again. ‘Mr. James abroad young woman, ever since she left Yarmouth Mr. James’s protection. We variety places, seen deal foreign country. We France, Switzerland, Italy, fact, almost parts.’ He looked back seat, he addressing that; softly played upon his hands, he striking chords upon dumb piano. ‘Mr. James took quite uncommonly young woman; settled, length time, I known since I his service. The young woman improvable, spoke languages; would not known country-person. I noticed she much admired wherever went.’ Miss Dartle put her hand upon her side. I saw steal glance her, slightly smile himself. ‘Very much admired, indeed, young woman was. What her dress; air sun; made much of; this, that, other; her merits really attracted general notice.’ He made short pause. Her eyes wandered restlessly distant prospect, she bit her nether lip stop busy mouth. Taking his hands seat, placing one within other, he settled one leg, Mr. Littimer proceeded, his eyes cast down, his respectable head little advanced, little one side: ‘The young woman went manner time, occasionally low her spirits, I think she began weary Mr. James giving way her low spirits tempers kind; things comfortable. Mr. James he began restless again. The restless he got, worse she got; I must say, myself, I difficult time indeed two. Still matters patched here, made good there, again; altogether lasted, I sure, longer time anybody could expected.’ Recalling her eyes distance, she looked now, her former air. Mr. Littimer, clearing his throat behind his hand respectable short cough, changed legs, went on: ‘At last, been, upon whole, good many words reproaches, Mr. James he set one morning, neighbourhood Naples, villa (the young woman partial sea), and, pretence coming back day so, left charge break out, that, general happiness concerned, he was’--here interruption short cough--‘gone. But Mr. James, I must say, certainly behave extremely honourable; he proposed young woman marry respectable person, fully prepared overlook past, was, least, good anybody young woman could aspired regular way: her connexions common.’ He changed legs again, wetted his lips. I convinced scoundrel spoke himself, I saw conviction reflected Miss Dartle’s face. ‘This I also charge communicate. I willing anything relieve Mr. James his difficulty, restore harmony affectionate parent, undergone much his account. Therefore I undertook commission. The young woman’s violence she came to, I broke fact his departure, beyond expectations. She quite mad, held force; or, she could not got knife, got sea, she would beaten her head marble floor.’ Miss Dartle, leaning back upon seat, light exultation her face, seemed almost caress sounds fellow uttered. ‘But I came second part entrusted me,’ said Mr. Littimer, rubbing his hands uneasily, ‘which anybody might supposed would been, events, appreciated kind intention, young woman came her true colours. A outrageous person I never see. Her conduct surprisingly bad. She gratitude, feeling, patience, reason her, stock stone. If I had not upon guard, I convinced she would blood.’ ‘I think better her it,’ said I, indignantly. Mr. Littimer bent his head, much say, ‘Indeed, sir? But you are young!’ resumed his narrative. ‘It necessary, short, time, take away everything nigh her, she could herself, anybody else, injury with, shut her close. Notwithstanding which, she got night; forced lattice window, I nailed myself; dropped vine trailed below; never seen heard of, knowledge, since.’ ‘She dead, perhaps,’ said Miss Dartle, smile, she could spurned body ruined girl. ‘She may drowned herself, miss,’ returned Mr. Littimer, catching excuse addressing somebody. ‘It is possible. Or, she may assistance boatmen, boatmen’s wives children. Being given low company, she much habit talking beach, Miss Dartle, sitting boats. I known her it, Mr. James away, whole days. Mr. James far pleased find out, once, she told children she boatman’s daughter, her country, long ago, she roamed beach, like them.’ Oh, Emily! Unhappy beauty! What picture rose her sitting far-off shore, among children like herself she innocent, listening little voices might called her Mother she poor man’s wife; great voice sea, eternal ‘Never more!’ ‘When clear nothing could done, Miss Dartle--’ ‘Did I tell speak me?’ she said, stern contempt. ‘You spoke me, miss,’ he replied. ‘I beg pardon. But service obey.’ ‘Do service,’ she returned. ‘Finish story, go!’ ‘When clear,’ he said, infinite respectability obedient bow, ‘that she found, I went Mr. James, place agreed I write him, informed occurred. Words passed us consequence, I felt due character leave him. I could bear, I borne, great deal Mr. James; he insulted far. He hurt me. Knowing unfortunate difference his mother, her anxiety mind likely be, I took liberty coming home England, relating--’ ‘For money I paid him,’ said Miss Dartle me. ‘Just so, madam--and relating I knew. I aware,’ said Mr. Littimer, moment’s reflection, ‘that anything else. I present employment, happy meet respectable situation.’ Miss Dartle glanced me, though she would inquire anything I desired ask. As something occurred mind, I said reply: ‘I could wish know this--creature,’ I could bring utter conciliatory word, ‘whether intercepted letter written her home, whether he supposes she received it.’ He remained calm silent, his eyes fixed ground, tip every finger his right hand delicately poised tip every finger his left. Miss Dartle turned her head disdainfully towards him. ‘I beg pardon, miss,’ he said, awakening his abstraction, ‘but, however submissive you, I position, though servant. Mr. Copperfield you, miss, different people. If Mr. Copperfield wishes know anything me, I take liberty reminding Mr. Copperfield he put question me. I character maintain.’ After momentary struggle myself, I turned eyes upon him, said, ‘You heard question. Consider addressed yourself, choose. What answer make?’ ‘Sir,’ he rejoined, occasional separation reunion delicate tips, ‘my answer must qualified; because, betray Mr. James’s confidence his mother, betray you, two different actions. It probable, I consider, Mr. James would encourage receipt letters likely increase low spirits unpleasantness; that, sir, I wish avoid going.’ ‘Is all?’ inquired Miss Dartle me. I indicated I nothing say. ‘Except,’ I added, I saw moving off, ‘that I understand fellow’s part wicked story, that, I shall make known honest man her father her childhood, I would recommend avoid going much public.’ He stopped moment I began, listened his usual repose manner. ‘Thank you, sir. But you will excuse I say, sir, neither slaves slave-drivers country, people allowed take law hands. If do, peril, I believe, people’s. Consequently speaking, I afraid going wherever I may wish, sir.’ With that, he made polite bow; and, another Miss Dartle, went away arch wall holly he come. Miss Dartle I regarded little silence; her manner exactly was, she produced man. ‘He says besides,’ she observed, slow curling her lip, ‘that his master, he hears, coasting Spain; done, away gratify his seafaring tastes till he weary. But interest you. Between two proud persons, mother son, wider breach before, little hope healing, one heart, time makes obstinate imperious. Neither interest you; introduces I wish say. This devil make angel of. I mean low girl he picked tide-mud,’ her black eyes full upon me, her passionate finger up, ‘may alive,--for I believe common things hard die. If she is, desire pearl price found taken care of. We desire that, too; he may chance made her prey again. So far, united one interest; I, would her mischief coarse wretch capable feeling, sent hear heard.’ I saw, change her face, someone advancing behind me. It Mrs. Steerforth, gave her hand coldly yore, augmentation her former stateliness manner, still, I perceived--and I touched it--with ineffaceable remembrance old love her son. She greatly altered. Her fine figure far less upright, her handsome face deeply marked, her hair almost white. But she sat seat, she handsome lady still; well I knew bright eye lofty look, light dreams school. ‘Is Mr. Copperfield informed everything, Rosa?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘And he heard Littimer himself?’ ‘Yes; I told wished it.’ ‘You good girl. I slight correspondence former friend, sir,’ addressing me, ‘but restored his sense duty natural obligation. Therefore I object this, Rosa mentioned. If, course may relieve mind decent man brought (for I sorry--I say more), son may saved falling snares designing enemy, well!’ She drew herself up, sat looking straight her, far away. ‘Madam,’ I said respectfully, ‘I understand. I assure I danger putting strained construction motives. But I must say, even you, known injured family childhood, suppose girl, deeply wronged, cruelly deluded, would rather die hundred deaths take cup water son’s hand now, cherish terrible mistake.’ ‘Well, Rosa, well!’ said Mrs. Steerforth, interpose, ‘it matter. Let be. You married, sir, I told?’ I answered I time married. ‘And well? I hear little quiet life I lead, I understand beginning famous.’ ‘I fortunate,’ I said, ‘and find name connected praise.’ ‘You mother?’--in softened voice. ‘No.’ ‘It pity,’ she returned. ‘She would proud you. Good night!’ I took hand she held dignified, unbending air, calm mine her breast peace. Her pride could still pulses, appeared, draw placid veil her face, she sat looking straight her far distance. As I moved away along terrace, I could help observing steadily sat gazing prospect, thickened closed around them. Here there, early lamps seen twinkle distant city; eastern quarter sky lurid light still hovered. But, greater part broad valley interposed, mist rising like sea, which, mingling darkness, made seem gathering waters would encompass them. I reason remember this, think awe; I looked upon two again, stormy sea risen feet. Reflecting thus told me, I felt right communicated Mr. Peggotty. On following evening I went London quest him. He always wandering place place, his one object recovering his niece him; London elsewhere. Often often, now, I seen dead night passing along streets, searching, among loitered doors untimely hours, he dreaded find. He kept lodging little chandler’s shop Hungerford Market, I occasion mention once, he first went forth upon his errand mercy. Hither I directed walk. On making inquiry him, I learned people house he gone yet, I find his room upstairs. He sitting reading window he kept plants. The room neat orderly. I saw moment always kept prepared her reception, he never went he thought possible he might bring her home. He heard tap door, raised his eyes I laid hand upon his shoulder. ‘Mas’r Davy! Thankee, sir! thankee hearty, visit! Sit ye down. You are kindly welcome, sir!’ ‘Mr. Peggotty,’ said I, taking chair he handed me, ‘do not expect much! I heard news.’ ‘Of Them’ly!’ He put his hand, nervous manner, his mouth, turned pale, he fixed his eyes mine. ‘It gives clue she is; she him.’ He sat down, looking intently me, listened profound silence I tell. I well remember sense dignity, beauty even, patient gravity his face impressed me, when, gradually removed his eyes mine, he sat looking downward, leaning his forehead his hand. He offered interruption, remained throughout perfectly still. He seemed pursue her figure narrative, let every shape go him, nothing. When I done, he shaded his face, continued silent. I looked window little while, occupied plants. ‘How fare feel it, Mas’r Davy?’ he inquired length. ‘I think she living,’ I replied. ‘I doen’t know. Maybe first shock rough, wildness her art--! That blue water she used speak on. Could she thowt many year, her grave!’ He said this, musing, low, frightened voice; walked across little room. ‘And yet,’ he added, ‘Mas’r Davy, I felt sure she living--I know’d, awake sleeping, trew I find her--I led it, held it--that I doen’t believe I deceived. No! Them’ly’s alive!’ He put his hand firmly table, set his sunburnt face resolute expression. ‘My niece, Them’ly, alive, sir!’ he said, steadfastly. ‘I doen’t know wheer comes from, ‘it is, I told she is alive!’ He looked almost like man inspired, he said it. I waited moments, he could give his undivided attention; proceeded explain precaution, that, occurred last night, would wise take. ‘Now, dear friend--‘I began. ‘Thankee, thankee, kind sir,’ he said, grasping hand his. ‘If she make her way London, likely--for could she lose herself readily vast city; would she wish do, lose hide herself, she go home?--’ ‘And she will not go home,’ he interposed, shaking his head mournfully. ‘If she left her accord, she might; It was, sir.’ ‘If she come here,’ said I, ‘I believe one person, here, likely discover her world. Do remember--hear I say, fortitude--think great object!--do remember Martha?’ ‘Of town?’ I needed answer his face. ‘Do know she London?’ ‘I seen her streets,’ he answered, shiver. ‘But do not know,’ said I, ‘that Emily charitable her, Ham’s help, long she fled home. Nor, that, met one night, spoke together room yonder, way, she listened door.’ ‘Mas’r Davy!’ he replied astonishment. ‘That night snew hard?’ ‘That night. I never seen her since. I went back, parting you, speak her, she gone. I unwilling mention her then, I now; she person I speak, I think communicate. Do understand?’ ‘Too well, sir,’ he replied. We sunk voices, almost whisper, continued speak tone. ‘You say seen her. Do think could find her? I could hope chance.’ ‘I think, Mas’r Davy, I know wheer look.’ ‘It dark. Being together, shall go now, try find her tonight?’ He assented, prepared accompany me. Without appearing observe he doing, I saw carefully he adjusted little room, put candle ready means lighting it, arranged bed, finally took drawer one her dresses (I remember seen her wear it), neatly folded garments, bonnet, he placed upon chair. He made allusion clothes, neither I. There waiting her, many many night, doubt. ‘The time was, Mas’r Davy,’ he said, came downstairs, ‘when I thowt girl, Martha, a’most like dirt underneath Them’ly’s feet. God forgive me, theer’s difference now!’ As went along, partly hold conversation, partly satisfy myself, I asked Ham. He said, almost words formerly, Ham same, ‘wearing away his life kiender care nohow ‘t; never murmuring, liked all’. I asked he thought Ham’s state mind was, reference misfortunes? Whether he believed dangerous? What he supposed, example, Ham would do, he Steerforth ever encounter? ‘I doen’t know, sir,’ he replied. ‘I thowt oftentimes, I cannot awize it, matters.’ I recalled his remembrance morning her departure, three beach. ‘Do recollect,’ said I, ‘a certain wild way he looked sea, spoke “the end it”?’ ‘Sure I do!’ said he. ‘What suppose he meant?’ ‘Mas’r Davy,’ he replied, ‘I have put question mort times, never found answer. And theer’s one curious thing--that, though he pleasant, I would not fare feel comfortable try get his mind upon ‘t. He never said wured warn’t dootiful dootiful could be, are not likely he would begin speak ways now; it is fur fleet water his mind, thowts lays. It is deep, sir, I cannot see down.’ ‘You right,’ said I, ‘and sometimes made anxious.’ ‘And too, Mas’r Davy,’ he rejoined. ‘Even so, I assure you, his ventersome ways, though belongs alteration him. I doen’t know he would violence circumstances, I hope two may kep asunders.’ We come, Temple Bar, city. Conversing now, walking side, he yielded one aim his devoted life, went on, hushed concentration his faculties would made his figure solitary multitude. We far Blackfriars Bridge, he turned his head pointed solitary female figure flitting along opposite side street. I knew it, readily, figure sought. We crossed road, pressing towards her, occurred she might disposed feel woman’s interest lost girl, spoke her quieter place, aloof crowd, less observed. I advised companion, therefore, address her yet, follow her; consulting this, likewise, indistinct desire I had, know she went. He acquiescing, followed distance: never losing sight her, never caring come near, she frequently looked about. Once, she stopped listen band music; stopped too. She went long way. Still went on. It evident, manner she held her course, she going fixed destination; this, her keeping busy streets, I suppose strange fascination secrecy mystery following anyone, made adhere first purpose. At length she turned dull, dark street, noise crowd lost; I said, ‘We may speak her now’; and, mending pace, went her. CHAPTER 47. MARTHA We Westminster. We turned back follow her, encountered her coming towards us; Westminster Abbey point she passed lights noise leading streets. She proceeded quickly, she got free two currents passengers setting towards bridge, that, advance she us she struck off, narrow water-side street Millbank came her. At moment she crossed road, avoid footsteps she heard close behind; and, without looking back, passed even rapidly. A glimpse river dull gateway, waggons housed night, seemed arrest feet. I touched companion without speaking, forbore cross her, followed opposite side way; keeping quietly could shadow houses, keeping near her. There was, I write, end low-lying street, dilapidated little wooden building, probably obsolete old ferry-house. Its position point street ceases, road begins lie row houses river. As soon she came here, saw water, she stopped she come her destination; presently went slowly along brink river, looking intently it. All way here, I supposed she going house; indeed, I vaguely entertained hope house might way associated lost girl. But one dark glimpse river, gateway, instinctively prepared her going farther. The neighbourhood dreary one time; oppressive, sad, solitary night, London. There neither wharves houses melancholy waste road near great blank Prison. A sluggish ditch deposited mud prison walls. Coarse grass rank weeds straggled marshy land vicinity. In one part, carcases houses, inauspiciously begun never finished, rotted away. In another, ground cumbered rusty iron monsters steam-boilers, wheels, cranks, pipes, furnaces, paddles, anchors, diving-bells, windmill-sails, I know strange objects, accumulated speculator, grovelling dust, underneath which--having sunk soil weight wet weather--they appearance vainly trying hide themselves. The clash glare sundry fiery Works upon river-side, arose night disturb everything except heavy unbroken smoke poured chimneys. Slimy gaps causeways, winding among old wooden piles, sickly substance clinging latter, like green hair, rags last year’s handbills offering rewards drowned men fluttering high-water mark, led ooze slush ebb-tide. There story one pits dug dead time Great Plague hereabout; blighting influence seemed proceeded whole place. Or else looked gradually decomposed nightmare condition, overflowings polluted stream. As she part refuse cast out, left corruption decay, girl followed strayed river’s brink, stood midst night-picture, lonely still, looking water. There boats barges astrand mud, enabled us come within yards her without seen. I signed Mr. Peggotty remain he was, emerged shade speak her. I approach her solitary figure without trembling; gloomy end her determined walk, way she stood, almost within cavernous shadow iron bridge, looking lights crookedly reflected strong tide, inspired dread within me. I think she talking herself. I sure, although absorbed gazing water, her shawl her shoulders, she muffling her hands it, unsettled bewildered way, like action sleep-walker waking person. I know, never forget, her wild manner gave assurance she would sink eyes, I her arm within grasp. At moment I said ‘Martha!’ She uttered terrified scream, struggled strength I doubt I could held her alone. But stronger hand mine laid upon her; she raised her frightened eyes saw whose was, she made one effort dropped us. We carried her away water dry stones, laid her down, crying moaning. In little she sat among stones, holding her wretched head her hands. ‘Oh, river!’ she cried passionately. ‘Oh, river!’ ‘Hush, hush!’ said I. ‘Calm yourself.’ But she still repeated words, continually exclaiming, ‘Oh, river!’ again. ‘I know it is like me!’ she exclaimed. ‘I know I belong it. I know it is natural company I am! It comes country places, harm it--and creeps dismal streets, defiled miserable--and goes away, like life, great sea, always troubled--and I feel I must go it!’ I never known despair was, except tone words. ‘I cannot keep away it. I cannot forget it. It haunts day night. It is thing world I fit for, that is fit me. Oh, dreadful river!’ The thought passed mind face companion, he looked upon her without speech motion, I might read his niece’s history, I known nothing it. I never saw, painting reality, horror compassion impressively blended. He shook he would fallen; his hand--I touched own, his appearance alarmed me--was deadly cold. ‘She state frenzy,’ I whispered him. ‘She speak differently little time.’ I do not know he would said answer. He made motion his mouth, seemed think he spoken; he pointed her his outstretched hand. A new burst crying came upon her now, she hid her face among stones, lay us, prostrate image humiliation ruin. Knowing state must pass, could speak her hope, I ventured restrain he would raised her, stood silence she became tranquil. ‘Martha,’ said I then, leaning down, helping her rise--she seemed want rise intention going away, she weak, leaned boat. ‘Do know is, me?’ She said faintly, ‘Yes.’ ‘Do know followed long way tonight?’ She shook her head. She looked neither me, stood humble attitude, holding her bonnet shawl one hand, without appearing conscious them, pressing other, clenched, her forehead. ‘Are composed enough,’ said I, ‘to speak subject interested you--I hope Heaven may remember it!--that snowy night?’ Her sobs broke afresh, she murmured inarticulate thanks driven her away door. ‘I want say nothing myself,’ she said, moments. ‘I bad, I lost. I hope all. But tell him, sir,’ she shrunk away him, ‘if do not feel hard it, I never way his misfortune.’ ‘It never attributed you,’ I returned, earnestly responding her earnestness. ‘It you, I do not deceive myself,’ she said, broken voice, ‘that came kitchen, night she took pity me; gentle me; did not shrink away like rest, gave kind help! Was you, sir?’ ‘It was,’ said I. ‘I river long ago,’ she said, glancing terrible expression, ‘if wrong her upon mind. I never could kept single winter’s night, I free share that!’ ‘The her flight well understood,’ I said. ‘You innocent part it, thoroughly believe,--we know.’ ‘Oh, I might much better her, I better heart!’ exclaimed girl, forlorn regret; ‘for she always good me! She never spoke word pleasant right. Is likely I would try make her I myself, knowing I myself, well? When I lost everything makes life dear, worst thoughts I parted ever her!’ Mr. Peggotty, standing one hand gunwale boat, his eyes cast down, put his disengaged hand his face. ‘And I heard happened snowy night, belonging town,’ cried Martha, ‘the bitterest thought mind was, people would remember she kept company me, would say I corrupted her! When, Heaven knows, I would died brought back her good name!’ Long unused self-control, piercing agony her remorse grief terrible. ‘To died, would much--what I say?---I would lived!’ she cried. ‘I would lived old, wretched streets--and wander about, avoided, dark--and see day break ghastly line houses, remember sun used shine room, wake once--I would done even that, save her!’ Sinking stones, she took hand, clenched up, she would ground them. She writhed new posture constantly: stiffening her arms, twisting her face, though shut her eyes little light was, drooping her head, heavy insupportable recollections. ‘What shall I ever do!’ she said, fighting thus her despair. ‘How I go I am, solitary curse myself, living disgrace everyone I come near!’ Suddenly she turned companion. ‘Stamp upon me, kill me! When she pride, would thought I done her harm I brushed her street. You cannot believe--why you?---a syllable comes lips. It would burning shame upon you, even now, she I exchanged word. I do not complain. I do not say she I alike--I know long, long way us. I say, guilt wretchedness upon head, I grateful her soul, love her. Oh, do not think power I loving anything quite worn out! Throw away, world does. Kill I am, ever known her; do not think me!’ He looked upon her, she made supplication, wild distracted manner; and, she silent, gently raised her. ‘Martha,’ said Mr. Peggotty, ‘God forbid I judge you. Forbid I, men, that, girl! You doen’t know half change that is come, course time, upon me, think likely. Well!’ he paused moment, went on. ‘You doen’t understand ‘it is gentleman wished speak you. You doen’t understand ‘it is afore us. Listen now!’ His influence upon her complete. She stood, shrinkingly, him, she afraid meet his eyes; her passionate sorrow quite hushed mute. ‘If heerd,’ said Mr. Peggotty, ‘owt passed Mas’r Davy me, th’ night snew hard, know I been--wheer not--fur seek dear niece. My dear niece,’ he repeated steadily. ‘Fur she is dear now, Martha, she dear afore.’ She put her hands her face; otherwise remained quiet. ‘I heerd her tell,’ said Mr. Peggotty, ‘as early left fatherless motherless, friend fur take, rough seafaring-way, place. Maybe guess you would friend, you would got way fond course time, niece kiender daughter-like me.’ As she silently trembling, he put her shawl carefully her, taking ground purpose. ‘Whereby,’ said he, ‘I know, she would go wureld’s furdest end me, she could see again; she would fly wureld’s furdest end keep seeing me. For though she are not call doubt love, doen’t--and doen’t,’ he repeated, quiet assurance truth he said, ‘there is shame steps in, keeps betwixt us.’ I read, every word his plain impressive way delivering himself, new evidence his thought one topic, every feature presented. ‘According reckoning,’ he proceeded, ‘Mas’r Davy’s here, mine, she like, one day, make her poor solitary course London. We believe--Mas’r Davy, me, us--that innocent everything befell her, unborn child. You have spoke her pleasant, kind, gentle you. Bless her, I knew she was! I knew she always was, all. You are thankful her, love her. Help us find her, may Heaven reward you!’ She looked hastily, first time, she doubtful he said. ‘Will trust me?’ she asked, low voice astonishment. ‘Full free!’ said Mr. Peggotty. ‘To speak her, I ever find her; shelter her, I shelter divide her; then, without her knowledge, come you, bring her?’ she asked hurriedly. We replied together, ‘Yes!’ She lifted her eyes, solemnly declared she would devote herself task, fervently faithfully. That she would never waver it, never diverted it, never relinquish it, chance hope. If she true it, might object she life, bound her something devoid evil, passing away her, leave her forlorn despairing, possible, she upon river’s brink night; might help, human Divine, renounce her evermore! She raise her voice her breath, address us, said night sky; stood profoundly quiet, looking gloomy water. We judged expedient, now, tell her knew; I recounted length. She listened great attention, face often changed, purpose varying expressions. Her eyes occasionally filled tears, she repressed. It seemed her spirit quite altered, she could quiet. She asked, told, communicated with, occasion arise. Under dull lamp road, I wrote two addresses leaf pocket-book, I tore gave her, she put her poor bosom. I asked her she lived herself. She said, pause, place long. It better know. Mr. Peggotty suggesting me, whisper, already occurred myself, I took purse; I could prevail upon her accept money, could I exact promise her she would another time. I represented her Mr. Peggotty could called, one his condition, poor; idea her engaging search, depending her resources, shocked us both. She continued steadfast. In particular, his influence upon her equally powerless mine. She gratefully thanked remained inexorable. ‘There may work got,’ she said. ‘I will try.’ ‘At least take assistance,’ I returned, ‘until tried.’ ‘I could I promised, money,’ she replied. ‘I could take it, I starving. To give money would take away trust, take away object given me, take away certain thing saves river.’ ‘In name great judge,’ said I, ‘before us must stand His dread time, dismiss terrible idea! We good, will.’ She trembled, her lip shook, her face paler, she answered: ‘It put hearts, perhaps, save wretched creature repentance. I afraid think so; seems bold. If good come me, I might begin hope; nothing harm ever come deeds yet. I trusted, first time long while, miserable life, account given try for. I know more, I say more.’ Again she repressed tears begun flow; and, putting her trembling hand, touching Mr. Peggotty, healing virtue him, went away along desolate road. She ill, probably long time. I observed, upon closer opportunity observation, she worn haggard, her sunken eyes expressed privation endurance. We followed her short distance, way lying direction, came back lighted populous streets. I implicit confidence her declaration, I put Mr. Peggotty, whether would seem, onset, like distrusting her, follow her farther. He mind, equally reliant her, suffered her take her road, took ours, towards Highgate. He accompanied good part way; parted, prayer success fresh effort, new thoughtful compassion I loss interpret. It midnight I arrived home. I reached gate, standing listening deep bell St. Paul’s, sound I thought borne towards among multitude striking clocks, I rather surprised see door aunt’s cottage open, faint light entry shining across road. Thinking aunt might relapsed one her old alarms, might watching progress imaginary conflagration distance, I went speak her. It great surprise I saw man standing her little garden. He glass bottle his hand, act drinking. I stopped short, among thick foliage outside, moon now, though obscured; I recognized man I supposed delusion Mr. Dick’s, encountered aunt streets city. He eating well drinking, seemed eat hungry appetite. He seemed curious regarding cottage, too, first time he seen it. After stooping put bottle ground, he looked windows, looked about; though covert impatient air, he anxious gone. The light passage obscured moment, aunt came out. She agitated, told money his hand. I heard chink. ‘What is use this?’ he demanded. ‘I spare more,’ returned aunt. ‘Then I cannot go,’ said he. ‘Here! You may take back!’ ‘You bad man,’ returned aunt, great emotion; ‘how use so? But I ask? It know weak I am! What I do, free ever visits, abandon deserts?’ ‘And do not abandon deserts?’ said he. ‘You ask why!’ returned aunt. ‘What heart must have!’ He stood moodily rattling money, shaking his head, length he said: ‘Is mean give me, then?’ ‘It I CAN give you,’ said aunt. ‘You know I losses, poorer I used be. I told so. Having got it, give pain looking another moment, seeing become?’ ‘I become shabby enough, mean that,’ he said. ‘I lead life owl.’ ‘You stripped greater part I ever had,’ said aunt. ‘You closed heart whole world, years years. You treated falsely, ungratefully, cruelly. Go, repent it. Do not add new injuries long, long list injuries done me!’ ‘Aye!’ he returned. ‘It is fine--Well! I must best I can, present, I suppose.’ In spite himself, he appeared abashed aunt’s indignant tears, came slouching garden. Taking two three quick steps, I come up, I met gate, went he came out. We eyed one another narrowly passing, favour. ‘Aunt,’ said I, hurriedly. ‘This man alarming again! Let speak him. Who he?’ ‘Child,’ returned aunt, taking arm, ‘come in, do not speak ten minutes.’ We sat her little parlour. My aunt retired behind round green fan former days, screwed back chair, occasionally wiped her eyes, quarter hour. Then she came out, took seat beside me. ‘Trot,’ said aunt, calmly, ‘it is husband.’ ‘Your husband, aunt? I thought he dead!’ ‘Dead me,’ returned aunt, ‘but living.’ I sat silent amazement. ‘Betsey Trotwood do not look likely subject tender passion,’ said aunt, composedly, ‘but time was, Trot, she believed man entirely. When she loved him, Trot, right well. When proof attachment affection she would given him. He repaid her breaking her fortune, nearly breaking her heart. So she put sort sentiment, ever, grave, filled up, flattened down.’ ‘My dear, good aunt!’ ‘I left him,’ aunt proceeded, laying her hand usual back mine, ‘generously. I may say distance time, Trot, I left generously. He cruel me, I might effected separation easy terms myself; I not. He soon made ducks drakes I gave him, sank lower lower, married another woman, I believe, became adventurer, gambler, cheat. What he now, see. But he fine-looking man I married him,’ said aunt, echo her old pride admiration her tone; ‘and I believed him--I fool!--to soul honour!’ She gave hand squeeze, shook her head. ‘He nothing now, Trot--less nothing. But, sooner punished his offences (as he would he prowled country), I give money I afford, intervals he reappears, go away. I fool I married him; I far incurable fool subject, that, sake I believed be, I would not even shadow idle fancy hardly dealt with. For I earnest, Trot, ever woman was.’ My aunt dismissed matter heavy sigh, smoothed her dress. ‘There, dear!’ she said. ‘Now know beginning, middle, end, it. We will not mention subject one another more; neither, course, mention anybody else. This grumpy, frumpy story, we will keep ourselves, Trot!’ CHAPTER 48. DOMESTIC I laboured hard book, without allowing interfere punctual discharge newspaper duties; came successful. I stunned praise sounded ears, notwithstanding I keenly alive it, thought better performance, I little doubt, anybody else did. It always observation human nature, man good reason believe never flourishes faces people order may believe him. For reason, I retained modesty self-respect; praise I got, I tried deserve. It purpose, record, though essentials written memory, pursue history fictions. They express themselves, I leave themselves. When I refer them, incidentally, part progress. Having foundation believing, time, nature accident made author, I pursued vocation confidence. Without assurance I certainly left alone, bestowed energy endeavour. I tried find nature accident really made me, that, nothing else. I writing, newspaper elsewhere, prosperously, new success achieved, I considered reasonably entitled escape dreary debates. One joyful night, therefore, I noted music parliamentary bagpipes last time, I never heard since; though I still recognize old drone newspapers, without substantial variation (except, perhaps, it), livelong session. I write time I married, I suppose, year half. After several varieties experiment, given housekeeping bad job. The house kept itself, kept page. The principal function retainer quarrel cook; respect he perfect Whittington, without his cat, remotest chance made Lord Mayor. He appears lived hail saucepan-lids. His whole existence scuffle. He would shriek help improper occasions,--as little dinner-party, friends evening,--and would come tumbling kitchen, iron missiles flying him. We wanted get rid him, he much attached us, would not go. He tearful boy, broke deplorable lamentations, cessation connexion hinted at, obliged keep him. He mother--no anything way relative, I could discover, except sister, fled America moment taken her hands; he became quartered us like horrible young changeling. He lively perception his unfortunate state, always rubbing his eyes sleeve his jacket, stooping blow his nose extreme corner little pocket-handkerchief, he never would take completely his pocket, always economized secreted. This unlucky page, engaged evil hour six pounds ten per annum, source continual trouble me. I watched he grew--and he grew like scarlet beans--with painful apprehensions time he would begin shave; even days he would bald grey. I saw prospect ever getting rid him; and, projecting future, used think inconvenience he would he old man. I never expected anything less, unfortunate’s manner getting difficulty. He stole Dora’s watch, which, like everything else belonging us, particular place own; and, converting money, spent produce (he always weak-minded boy) incessantly riding London Uxbridge outside coach. He taken Bow Street, well I remember, completion his fifteenth journey; four-and-sixpence, second-hand fife he could not play, found upon his person. The surprise consequences would much less disagreeable he penitent. But he penitent indeed, peculiar way--not lump, instalments. For example: day I obliged appear him, he made certain revelations touching hamper cellar, believed full wine, nothing except bottles corks. We supposed he eased his mind, told worst he knew cook; but, day two afterwards, his conscience sustained new twinge, he disclosed she little girl, who, early every morning, took away bread; also he suborned maintain milkman coals. In two three days more, I informed authorities his led discovery sirloins beef among kitchen-stuff, sheets rag-bag. A little afterwards, he broke entirely new direction, confessed knowledge burglarious intentions premises, part pot-boy, immediately taken up. I got ashamed victim, I would given money hold his tongue, would offered round bribe his permitted run away. It aggravating circumstance case he idea this, conceived he making amends every new discovery: say, heaping obligations head. At last I ran away myself, whenever I saw emissary police approaching new intelligence; lived stealthy life he tried ordered transported. Even he could not quiet, always writing us letters; wanted much see Dora he went away, Dora went visit him, fainted she found herself inside iron bars. In short, I peace life he expatriated, made (as I afterwards heard) shepherd of, ‘up country’ somewhere; I geographical idea where. All led serious reflections, presented mistakes new aspect; I could help communicating Dora one evening, spite tenderness her. ‘My love,’ said I, ‘it painful think want system management, involves (which got used to), people.’ ‘You silent long time, going cross!’ said Dora. ‘No, dear, indeed! Let explain I mean.’ ‘I think I do not want know,’ said Dora. ‘But I want know, love. Put Jip down.’ Dora put his nose mine, said ‘Boh!’ drive seriousness away; but, succeeding, ordered his Pagoda, sat looking me, her hands folded, resigned little expression countenance. ‘The fact is, dear,’ I began, ‘there contagion us. We infect everyone us.’ I might gone figurative manner, Dora’s face admonished she wondering her might whether I going propose new kind vaccination, medical remedy, unwholesome state ours. Therefore I checked myself, made meaning plainer. ‘It merely, pet,’ said I, ‘that lose money comfort, even temper sometimes, learning careful; incur serious responsibility spoiling everyone comes service, dealings us. I begin afraid fault entirely one side, people turn ill do not turn well ourselves.’ ‘Oh, accusation,’ exclaimed Dora, opening her eyes wide; ‘to say ever saw take gold watches! Oh!’ ‘My dearest,’ I remonstrated, ‘do not talk preposterous nonsense! Who made least allusion gold watches?’ ‘You did,’ returned Dora. ‘You know did. You said I had not turned well, compared him.’ ‘To whom?’ I asked. ‘To page,’ sobbed Dora. ‘Oh, cruel fellow, compare affectionate wife transported page! Why did not tell opinion married? Why did not say, hard-hearted thing, convinced I worse transported page? Oh, dreadful opinion me! Oh, goodness!’ ‘Now, Dora, love,’ I returned, gently trying remove handkerchief she pressed her eyes, ‘this ridiculous you, wrong. In first place, it is true.’ ‘You always said he story-teller,’ sobbed Dora. ‘And say me! Oh, shall I do! What shall I do!’ ‘My darling girl,’ I retorted, ‘I really must entreat reasonable, listen I say, say. My dear Dora, unless learn duty employ, never learn duty us. I afraid present opportunities people wrong, never ought presented. Even lax are, arrangements, choice--which not--even liked it, found agreeable so--which do not--I persuaded right go way. We positively corrupting people. We bound think that. I cannot help thinking it, Dora. It reflection I unable dismiss, sometimes makes uneasy. There, dear, that is all. Come now. Do not foolish!’ Dora would allow me, long time, remove handkerchief. She sat sobbing murmuring behind it, that, I uneasy, I ever married? Why had not I said, even day went church, I knew I uneasy, I would rather not? If I could not bear her, did not I send her away her aunts Putney, Julia Mills India? Julia would glad see her, would call her transported page; Julia never called her anything sort. In short, Dora afflicted, afflicted condition, I felt use repeating kind effort, though never mildly, I must take course. What course left take? To ‘form her mind’? This common phrase words fair promising sound, I resolved form Dora’s mind. I began immediately. When Dora childish, I would infinitely preferred humour her, I tried grave--and disconcerted her, too. I talked her subjects occupied thoughts; I read Shakespeare her--and fatigued her last degree. I accustomed giving her, quite casually, little scraps useful information, sound opinion--and she started I let off, crackers. No matter incidentally naturally I endeavoured form little wife’s mind, I could help seeing she always instinctive perception I about, became prey keenest apprehensions. In particular, clear me, she thought Shakespeare terrible fellow. The formation went slowly. I pressed Traddles service without his knowledge; whenever he came see us, exploded mines upon edification Dora second hand. The amount practical wisdom I bestowed upon Traddles manner immense, best quality; effect upon Dora depress her spirits, make her always nervous dread would her turn next. I found condition schoolmaster, trap, pitfall; always playing spider Dora’s fly, always pouncing hole her infinite disturbance. Still, looking forward intermediate stage, time perfect sympathy Dora me, I ‘formed her mind’ entire satisfaction, I persevered, even months. Finding last, however, that, although I time porcupine hedgehog, bristling determination, I effected nothing, began occur perhaps Dora’s mind already formed. On consideration appeared likely, I abandoned scheme, promising appearance words action; resolving henceforth satisfied child-wife, try change her nothing else process. I heartily tired sagacious prudent myself, seeing darling restraint; I bought pretty pair ear-rings her, collar Jip, went home one day make agreeable. Dora delighted little presents, kissed joyfully; shadow us, however slight, I made mind there. If must shadow anywhere, I would keep future breast. I sat wife sofa, put ear-rings her ears; I told her I feared quite good company lately, used be, fault mine. Which I sincerely felt, indeed was. ‘The truth is, Dora, life,’ I said; ‘I trying wise.’ ‘And make wise too,’ said Dora, timidly. ‘Have not you, Doady?’ I nodded assent pretty inquiry raised eyebrows, kissed parted lips. ‘It is bit use,’ said Dora, shaking her head, ear-rings rang again. ‘You know little thing I am, I wanted call first. If cannot so, I afraid you will never like me. Are sure do not think, sometimes, would better have--’ ‘Done what, dear?’ For she made effort proceed. ‘Nothing!’ said Dora. ‘Nothing?’ I repeated. She put her arms round neck, laughed, called herself her favourite name goose, hid her face shoulder profusion curls quite task clear away see it. ‘Do not I think would better done nothing, tried form little wife’s mind?’ said I, laughing myself. ‘Is question? Yes, indeed, I do.’ ‘Is trying?’ cried Dora. ‘Oh shocking boy!’ ‘But I shall never try more,’ said I. ‘For I love her dearly she is.’ ‘Without story--really?’ inquired Dora, creeping closer me. ‘Why I seek change,’ said I, ‘what precious long! You never show better natural self, sweet Dora; we will try conceited experiments, go back old way, happy.’ ‘And happy!’ returned Dora. ‘Yes! All day! And will not mind things going tiny morsel wrong, sometimes?’ ‘No, no,’ said I. ‘We must best can.’ ‘And will not tell me, more, make people bad,’ coaxed Dora; ‘will you? Because know it is dreadfully cross!’ ‘No, no,’ said I. ‘It is better stupid uncomfortable, is not it?’ said Dora. ‘Better naturally Dora anything else world.’ ‘In world! Ah, Doady, it is large place!’ She shook her head, turned her delighted bright eyes mine, kissed me, broke merry laugh, sprang away put Jip’s new collar. So ended last attempt make change Dora. I unhappy trying it; I could endure solitary wisdom; I could reconcile her former appeal child-wife. I resolved I could, quiet way, improve proceedings myself, I foresaw utmost would little, I must degenerate spider again, ever lying wait. And shadow I mentioned, us more, rest wholly heart? How fall? The old unhappy feeling pervaded life. It deepened, changed all; undefined ever, addressed like strain sorrowful music faintly heard night. I loved wife dearly, I happy; happiness I vaguely anticipated, once, happiness I enjoyed, always something wanting. In fulfilment compact I made myself, reflect mind paper, I examine it, closely, bring secrets light. What I missed, I still regarded--I always regarded--as something dream youthful fancy; incapable realization; I discovering so, natural pain, men did. But would better wife could helped more, shared many thoughts I partner; might been; I knew. Between two irreconcilable conclusions: one, I felt general unavoidable; other, particular me, might different: I balanced curiously, distinct sense opposition other. When I thought airy dreams youth incapable realization, I thought better state preceding manhood I outgrown; contented days Agnes, dear old house, arose me, like spectres dead, might renewal another world, never could reanimated here. Sometimes, speculation came thoughts, What might happened, would happened, Dora I never known other? But she incorporated existence, idlest fancies, would soon rise reach sight, like gossamer floating air. I always loved her. What I describing, slumbered, half awoke, slept again, innermost recesses mind. There evidence me; I know influence anything I said did. I bore weight little cares, projects; Dora held pens; felt shares adjusted case required. She truly fond me, proud me; Agnes wrote earnest words her letters Dora, pride interest old friends heard growing reputation, read book heard speaking contents, Dora read tears joy her bright eyes, said I dear old clever, famous boy. ‘The first mistaken impulse undisciplined heart.’ Those words Mrs. Strong’s constantly recurring me, time; almost always present mind. I awoke them, often, night; I remember even read them, dreams, inscribed upon walls houses. For I knew, now, heart undisciplined first loved Dora; disciplined, never could felt, married, felt secret experience. ‘There disparity marriage, like unsuitability mind purpose.’ Those words I remembered too. I endeavoured adapt Dora myself, found impracticable. It remained adapt Dora; share her I could, happy; bear shoulders I must, happy still. This discipline I tried bring heart, I began think. It made second year much happier first; and, better still, made Dora’s life sunshine. But, year wore on, Dora strong. I hoped lighter hands mine would help mould her character, baby-smile upon her breast might change child-wife woman. It be. The spirit fluttered moment threshold little prison, and, unconscious captivity, took wing. ‘When I run again, I used do, aunt,’ said Dora, ‘I shall make Jip race. He getting quite slow lazy.’ ‘I suspect, dear,’ said aunt quietly working her side, ‘he worse disorder that. Age, Dora.’ ‘Do think he old?’ said Dora, astonished. ‘Oh, strange seems Jip old!’ ‘It is complaint liable to, Little One, get life,’ said aunt, cheerfully; ‘I do not feel free I used be, I assure you.’ ‘But Jip,’ said Dora, looking compassion, ‘even little Jip! Oh, poor fellow!’ ‘I dare say he will last long time yet, Blossom,’ said aunt, patting Dora cheek, she leaned her couch look Jip, responded standing his hind legs, baulking various asthmatic attempts scramble head shoulders. ‘He must piece flannel his house winter, I should not wonder he came quite fresh again, flowers spring. Bless little dog!’ exclaimed aunt, ‘if he many lives cat, point losing ‘them all, he would bark his last breath, I believe!’ Dora helped sofa; he really defying aunt furious extent, he could not keep straight, barked sideways. The aunt looked him, he reproached her; she lately taken spectacles, inscrutable reason he considered glasses personal. Dora made lie her, good deal persuasion; he quiet, drew one his long ears her hand, repeating thoughtfully, ‘Even little Jip! Oh, poor fellow!’ ‘His lungs good enough,’ said aunt, gaily, ‘and his dislikes feeble. He good many years him, doubt. But want dog race with, Little Blossom, he lived well that, I will give one.’ ‘Thank you, aunt,’ said Dora, faintly. ‘But do not, please!’ ‘No?’ said aunt, taking her spectacles. ‘I could not dog Jip,’ said Dora. ‘It would unkind Jip! Besides, I could not friends dog Jip; he would not known I married, would not barked Doady he first came house. I could not care dog Jip, I afraid, aunt.’ ‘To sure!’ said aunt, patting her cheek again. ‘You right.’ ‘You offended,’ said Dora. ‘Are you?’ ‘Why, sensitive pet is!’ cried aunt, bending her affectionately. ‘To think I could offended!’ ‘No, no, I did not really think so,’ returned Dora; ‘but I little tired, made silly moment--I always silly little thing, know, made silly--to talk Jip. He known happened me, have not you, Jip? And I could not bear slight him, he little altered--could I, Jip?’ Jip nestled closer his mistress, lazily licked her hand. ‘You old, Jip, you, you will leave mistress yet?’ said Dora. ‘We may keep one another company little longer!’ My pretty Dora! When she came dinner ensuing Sunday, glad see old Traddles (who always dined us Sunday), thought she would ‘running she used do’, days. But said, wait days more; then, wait days more; still she neither ran walked. She looked pretty, merry; little feet used nimble danced round Jip, dull motionless. I began carry her downstairs every morning, upstairs every night. She would clasp round neck laugh, while, I wager. Jip would bark caper round us, go before, look back landing, breathing short, see coming. My aunt, best cheerful nurses, would trudge us, moving mass shawls pillows. Mr. Dick would relinquished his post candle-bearer anyone alive. Traddles would often bottom staircase, looking on, taking charge sportive messages Dora dearest girl world. We made quite gay procession it, child-wife gayest there. But, sometimes, I took her up, felt she lighter arms, dead blank feeling came upon me, I approaching frozen region yet unseen, numbed life. I avoided recognition feeling name, communing myself; one night, strong upon me, aunt left her parting cry ‘Good night, Little Blossom,’ I sat desk alone, tried think, Oh fatal name was, blossom withered bloom upon tree! CHAPTER 49. I AM INVOLVED IN MYSTERY I received one morning post, following letter, dated Canterbury, addressed Doctor’s Commons; I read surprise: ‘MY DEAR SIR, ‘Circumstances beyond individual control have, considerable lapse time, effected severance intimacy which, limited opportunities conceded midst professional duties, contemplating scenes events past, tinged prismatic hues memory, ever afforded me, ever must continue afford, gratifying emotions common description. This fact, dear sir, combined distinguished elevation talents raised you, deters presuming aspire liberty addressing companion youth, familiar appellation Copperfield!

The canker flower. The cup bitter brim. The worm his work, soon dispose his victim. The sooner better. But I digress. ‘Placed mental position peculiar painfulness, beyond assuaging reach even Mrs. Micawber’s influence, though exercised tripartite character woman, wife, mother, intention fly short period, devote respite eight-and-forty hours revisiting metropolitan scenes past enjoyment. Among havens domestic tranquillity peace mind, feet naturally tend towards King’s Bench Prison. In stating I shall (D.

I confine throwing observation, that, hour place I indicated, may found ruined vestiges yet ‘Remain, ‘Of ‘A ‘Fallen Tower, ‘WILKINS MICAWBER. ‘P.S. It may advisable superadd above, statement Mrs. Micawber confidential possession intentions.’ I read letter several times. Making due allowance Mr. Micawber’s lofty style composition, extraordinary relish he sat wrote long letters possible impossible occasions, I still believed something important lay hidden bottom roundabout communication. I put down, think it; took again, read more; still pursuing it, Traddles found height perplexity. ‘My dear fellow,’ said I, ‘I never better pleased see you. You come give benefit sober judgement opportune time. I received singular letter, Traddles, Mr. Micawber.’ ‘No?’ cried Traddles. ‘You do not say so? And I received one Mrs. Micawber!’ With that, Traddles, flushed walking, whose hair, combined effects exercise excitement, stood end he saw cheerful ghost, produced his letter made exchange me. I watched heart Mr. Micawber’s letter, returned elevation eyebrows he said “‘Wielding thunderbolt, directing devouring avenging flame!” Bless me, Copperfield!’--and entered perusal Mrs. Micawber’s epistle. It ran thus: ‘My best regards Mr. Thomas Traddles, he still remember one formerly happiness well acquainted him, may I beg moments his leisure time? I assure Mr. T. T. I would intrude upon his kindness, I position confines distraction. ‘Though harrowing mention, alienation Mr. Micawber (formerly domesticated) his wife family, addressing unhappy appeal Mr. Traddles, soliciting his best indulgence.

Scarcely day passes, I assure Mr. Traddles, paroxysm take place. Mr. T. require depict feelings, I inform I become accustomed hear Mr. Micawber assert he sold D.

Oh no, would much! ‘If Mr. Copperfield yet remember one unknown fame, Mr. T. take charge unalterable regards similar entreaties? In case, he benevolence consider communication strictly private, account whatever alluded to, however distantly, presence Mr. Micawber. If Mr. T. ever reply (which I cannot feel improbable), letter addressed M. E., Post Office, Canterbury, fraught less painful consequences addressed immediately one, subscribes herself, extreme distress, ‘Mr. Thomas Traddles’s respectful friend suppliant, ‘EMMA MICAWBER.’ ‘What think letter?’ said Traddles, casting his eyes upon me, I read twice. ‘What think other?’ said I. For he still reading knitted brows. ‘I think two together, Copperfield,’ replied Traddles, ‘mean Mr. Mrs. Micawber usually mean correspondence--but I do not know what. They written good faith, I doubt, without collusion. Poor thing!’ he alluding Mrs. Micawber’s letter, standing side side comparing two; ‘it charity write her, events, tell her fail see Mr. Micawber.’ I acceded readily, I reproached treated her former letter rather lightly. It set thinking good deal time, I mentioned place; absorption affairs, experience family, hearing nothing more, gradually ended dismissing subject. I often thought Micawbers, chiefly wonder ‘pecuniary liabilities’ establishing Canterbury, recall shy Mr. Micawber he became clerk Uriah Heep. However, I wrote comforting letter Mrs. Micawber, joint names, signed it. As walked town post it, Traddles I held long conference, launched number speculations, I need repeat. We took aunt counsels afternoon; decided conclusion was, would punctual keeping Mr. Micawber’s appointment. Although appeared stipulated place quarter hour time, found Mr. Micawber already there. He standing his arms folded, wall, looking spikes top, sentimental expression, interlacing boughs trees shaded his youth. When accosted him, his manner something confused, something less genteel, yore. He relinquished his legal suit black purposes excursion, wore old surtout tights, quite old air. He gradually picked conversed him; but, his eye-glass seemed hang less easily, his shirt-collar, though still old formidable dimensions, rather drooped. ‘Gentlemen!’ said Mr. Micawber, first salutations, ‘you friends need, friends indeed. Allow offer inquiries reference physical welfare Mrs. Copperfield esse, Mrs. Traddles posse,--presuming, say, friend Mr. Traddles yet united object his affections, weal woe.’ We acknowledged his politeness, made suitable replies. He directed attention wall, beginning, ‘I assure you, gentlemen,’ I ventured object ceremonious form address, beg he would speak us old way. ‘My dear Copperfield,’ he returned, pressing hand, ‘your cordiality overpowers me. This reception shattered fragment Temple called Man--if I may permitted express myself--bespeaks heart honour common nature. I observe I behold serene spot happiest hours existence fleeted by.’ ‘Made so, I sure, Mrs. Micawber,’ said I. ‘I hope she well?’ ‘Thank you,’ returned Mr. Micawber, whose face clouded reference, ‘she so-so. And this,’ said Mr. Micawber, nodding his head sorrowfully, ‘is Bench! Where, first time many revolving years, overwhelming pressure pecuniary liabilities proclaimed, day day, importune voices declining vacate passage; knocker door creditor appeal to; personal service process required, detainees merely lodged gate! Gentlemen,’ said Mr. Micawber, ‘when shadow iron-work summit brick structure reflected gravel Parade, I seen children thread mazes intricate pattern, avoiding dark marks. I familiar every stone place. If I betray weakness, know excuse me.’ ‘We got life since then, Mr. Micawber,’ said I. ‘Mr. Copperfield,’ returned Mr. Micawber, bitterly, ‘when I inmate retreat I could look fellow-man face, punch his head he offended me. My fellow-man longer glorious terms!’ Turning building downcast manner, Mr. Micawber accepted proffered arm one side, proffered arm Traddles other, walked away us. ‘There landmarks,’ observed Mr. Micawber, looking fondly back his shoulder, ‘on road tomb, which, impiety aspiration, man would wish never passed. Such Bench chequered career.’ ‘Oh, low spirits, Mr. Micawber,’ said Traddles. ‘I am, sir,’ interposed Mr. Micawber. ‘I hope,’ said Traddles, ‘it conceived dislike law--for I lawyer myself, know.’ Mr. Micawber answered word. ‘How friend Heep, Mr. Micawber?’ said I, silence. ‘My dear Copperfield,’ returned Mr. Micawber, bursting state much excitement, turning pale, ‘if ask employer YOUR friend, I sorry it; ask MY friend, I sardonically smile it. In whatever capacity ask employer, I beg, without offence you, limit reply this--that whatever his state health may be, his appearance foxy: say diabolical. You allow me, private individual, decline pursuing subject lashed utmost verge desperation professional capacity.’ I expressed regret innocently touched upon theme roused much. ‘May I ask,’ said I, ‘without hazard repeating mistake, old friends Mr. Miss Wickfield are?’ ‘Miss Wickfield,’ said Mr. Micawber, turning red, ‘is, she always is, pattern, bright example. My dear Copperfield, she starry spot miserable existence. My respect young lady, admiration her character, devotion her her love truth, goodness!--Take me,’ said Mr. Micawber, ‘down turning, for, upon soul, present state mind I equal this!’ We wheeled narrow street, he took his pocket-handkerchief, stood his back wall. If I looked gravely Traddles did, he must found company means inspiriting. ‘It fate,’ said Mr. Micawber, unfeignedly sobbing, even that, shadow old expression something genteel; ‘it fate, gentlemen, finer feelings nature become reproaches me. My homage Miss Wickfield, flight arrows bosom. You better leave me, please, walk earth vagabond. The worm settle business double-quick time.’ Without attending invocation, stood by, he put his pocket-handkerchief, pulled his shirt-collar, and, delude person neighbourhood might observing him, hummed tune his hat much one side. I mentioned--not knowing might lost lost sight yet--that would give great pleasure introduce aunt, he would ride Highgate, bed his service. ‘You shall make us glass punch, Mr. Micawber,’ said I, ‘and forget whatever mind, pleasanter reminiscences.’ ‘Or, confiding anything friends likely relieve you, shall impart us, Mr. Micawber,’ said Traddles, prudently. ‘Gentlemen,’ returned Mr. Micawber, ‘do will! I straw upon surface deep, tossed directions elephants--I beg pardon; I said elements.’ We walked on, arm-in-arm, again; found coach act starting; arrived Highgate without encountering difficulties way. I uneasy uncertain mind say best--so Traddles, evidently. Mr. Micawber part plunged deep gloom. He occasionally made attempt smarten himself, hum fag-end tune; his relapses profound melancholy made impressive mockery hat exceedingly one side, shirt-collar pulled his eyes. We went aunt’s house rather mine, Dora’s well. My aunt presented herself sent for, welcomed Mr. Micawber gracious cordiality. Mr. Micawber kissed her hand, retired window, pulling his pocket-handkerchief, mental wrestle himself. Mr. Dick home. He nature exceedingly compassionate anyone seemed ill ease, quick find person out, he shook hands Mr. Micawber, least half-a-dozen times five minutes. To Mr. Micawber, his trouble, warmth, part stranger, extremely touching, he could say, occasion successive shake, ‘My dear sir, overpower me!’ Which gratified Mr. Dick much, he went greater vigour before. ‘The friendliness gentleman,’ said Mr. Micawber aunt, ‘if allow me, madam, cull figure speech vocabulary coarser national sports--floors me. To man struggling complicated burden perplexity disquiet, reception trying, I assure you.’ ‘My friend Mr. Dick,’ replied aunt proudly, ‘is common man.’ ‘That I convinced of,’ said Mr. Micawber. ‘My dear sir!’ Mr. Dick shaking hands again; ‘I deeply sensible cordiality!’ ‘How find yourself?’ said Mr. Dick, anxious look. ‘Indifferent, dear sir,’ returned Mr. Micawber, sighing. ‘You must keep spirits,’ said Mr. Dick, ‘and make comfortable possible.’ Mr. Micawber quite overcome friendly words, finding Mr. Dick’s hand within his own. ‘It lot,’ he observed, ‘to meet, diversified panorama human existence, occasional oasis, never one green, gushing, present!’ At another time I amused this; I felt constrained uneasy, I watched Mr. Micawber anxiously, his vacillations evident disposition reveal something, counter-disposition reveal nothing, I perfect fever. Traddles, sitting edge his chair, his eyes wide open, his hair emphatically erect ever, stared turns ground Mr. Micawber, without much attempting put word. My aunt, though I saw her shrewdest observation concentrated her new guest, useful possession her wits either us; she held conversation, made necessary talk, whether he liked not. ‘You old friend nephew’s, Mr. Micawber,’ said aunt. ‘I wish I pleasure seeing before.’ ‘Madam,’ returned Mr. Micawber, ‘I wish I honour knowing earlier period. I always wreck present behold.’ ‘I hope Mrs. Micawber family well, sir,’ said aunt. Mr. Micawber inclined his head. ‘They well, madam,’ he desperately observed pause, ‘as Aliens Outcasts ever hope be.’ ‘Lord bless you, sir!’ exclaimed aunt, her abrupt way. ‘What talking about?’ ‘The subsistence family, madam,’ returned Mr. Micawber, ‘trembles balance. My employer--’ Here Mr. Micawber provokingly left off; began peel lemons directions set him, together appliances he used making punch. ‘Your employer, know,’ said Mr. Dick, jogging his arm gentle reminder. ‘My good sir,’ returned Mr. Micawber, ‘you recall me, I obliged you.’ They shook hands again. ‘My employer, madam--Mr. Heep--once favour observe me, I receipt stipendiary emoluments appertaining engagement him, I probably mountebank country, swallowing sword-blade, eating devouring element. For anything I perceive contrary, still probable children may reduced seek livelihood personal contortion, Mrs. Micawber abets unnatural feats playing barrel-organ.’ Mr. Micawber, random expressive flourish his knife, signified performances might expected take place he more; resumed his peeling desperate air. My aunt leaned her elbow little round table she usually kept beside her, eyed attentively. Notwithstanding aversion I regarded idea entrapping disclosure he prepared make voluntarily, I taken point, strange proceedings I saw engaged; whereof his putting lemon-peel kettle, sugar snuffer-tray, spirit empty jug, confidently attempting pour boiling water candlestick, among remarkable. I saw crisis hand, came. He clattered his means implements together, rose his chair, pulled his pocket-handkerchief, burst tears. ‘My dear Copperfield,’ said Mr. Micawber, behind his handkerchief, ‘this occupation, others, requiring untroubled mind, self-respect. I cannot perform it. It question.’ ‘Mr. Micawber,’ said I, ‘what matter? Pray speak out. You among friends.’ ‘Among friends, sir!’ repeated Mr. Micawber; he reserved came breaking him. ‘Good heavens, principally I AM among friends state mind is. What matter, gentlemen? What NOT matter? Villainy matter; baseness matter; deception, fraud, conspiracy, matter; name whole atrocious mass is--HEEP!’ My aunt clapped her hands, started possessed. ‘The struggle over!’ said Mr. Micawber violently gesticulating his pocket-handkerchief, fairly striking time time arms, he swimming superhuman difficulties. ‘I lead life longer. I wretched being, cut everything makes life tolerable. I Taboo infernal scoundrel’s service. Give back wife, give back family, substitute Micawber petty wretch walks boots present feet, call upon swallow sword tomorrow, I will it. With appetite!’ I never saw man hot life. I tried calm him, might come something rational; he got hotter hotter, would not hear word. ‘I will put hand man’s hand,’ said Mr. Micawber, gasping, puffing, sobbing, degree he like man fighting cold water, ‘until I have--blown fragments--the--a--detestable--serpent--HEEP! I will partake one’s hospitality, I have--a--moved Mount Vesuvius--to eruption--on--a--the abandoned rascal--HEEP! Refreshment--a--underneath roof--particularly punch--would--a--choke me--unless--I had--previously--choked eyes--out head--a--of--interminable cheat, liar--HEEP! I--a--I will know nobody--and--a--say nothing--and--a--live nowhere--until I crushed--to--a--undiscoverable atoms--the--transcendent immortal hypocrite perjurer--HEEP!’ I really fear Mr. Micawber’s dying spot. The manner he struggled inarticulate sentences, and, whenever he found getting near name Heep, fought his way it, dashed fainting state, brought vehemence little less marvellous, frightful; now, he sank chair, steaming, looked us, every possible colour his face business there, endless procession lumps following one another hot haste his throat, whence seemed shoot his forehead, he appearance last extremity. I would gone his assistance, he waved off, would not hear word. ‘No, Copperfield!--No communication--a--until--Miss Wickfield--a--redress wrongs inflicted consummate scoundrel--HEEP!’ (I quite convinced he could uttered three words, amazing energy word inspired he felt coming.) ‘Inviolable secret--a--from whole world--a--no exceptions--this day week--a--at breakfast-time--a--everybody present--including aunt--a--and extremely friendly gentleman--to hotel Canterbury--a--where--Mrs. Micawber myself--Auld Lang Syne chorus--and--a--will expose intolerable ruffian--HEEP! No say--a--or listen persuasion--go immediately--not capable--a--bear society--upon track devoted doomed traitor--HEEP!’ With last repetition magic word kept going all, he surpassed his previous efforts, Mr. Micawber rushed house; leaving us state excitement, hope, wonder, reduced us condition little better his own. But even his passion writing letters strong resisted; yet height excitement, hope, wonder, following pastoral note brought neighbouring tavern, he called write it:-- ‘Most secret confidential. ‘MY DEAR SIR, ‘I beg allowed convey, you, apologies excellent aunt late excitement. An explosion smouldering volcano long suppressed, result internal contest easily conceived described. ‘I trust I rendered tolerably intelligible appointment morning day week, house public entertainment Canterbury, Mrs. Micawber honour uniting voices yours, well-known strain Immortal exciseman nurtured beyond Tweed. ‘The duty done, act reparation performed, alone enable contemplate fellow mortal, I shall known more.

Mr. PEGGOTTY’S DREAM COMES TRUE By time, months passed since interview bank river Martha. I never seen her since, she communicated Mr. Peggotty several occasions. Nothing come her zealous intervention; could I infer, he told me, clue obtained, moment, Emily’s fate. I confess I began despair her recovery, gradually sink deeper deeper belief she dead. His conviction remained unchanged. So far I know--and I believe his honest heart transparent me--he never wavered again, his solemn certainty finding her. His patience never tired. And, although I trembled agony might one day his strong assurance shivered blow, something religious it, affectingly expressive anchor purest depths his fine nature, respect honour I held exalted every day. His lazy trustfulness hoped, more. He man sturdy action his life, he knew things wherein he wanted help he must his part faithfully, help himself. I known set night, misgiving light might be, accident, window old boat, walk Yarmouth. I known him, reading something newspaper might apply her, take his stick, go forth journey three--or four-score miles. He made his way sea Naples, back, hearing narrative Miss Dartle assisted me. All his journeys ruggedly performed; he always steadfast purpose saving money Emily’s sake, she found. In long pursuit, I never heard repine; I never heard say he fatigued, heart. Dora often seen since marriage, quite fond him. I fancy his figure now, standing near her sofa, his rough cap his hand, blue eyes child-wife raised, timid wonder, his face. Sometimes evening, twilight, he came talk me, I would induce smoke his pipe garden, slowly paced fro together; then, picture his deserted home, comfortable air used childish eyes evening fire burning, wind moaning round it, came vividly mind. One evening, hour, he told he found Martha waiting near his lodging preceding night he came out, she asked leave London account, he seen her again. ‘Did she tell why?’ I inquired. ‘I asked her, Mas’r Davy,’ he replied, ‘but words she ever says, she on’y got promise went away.’ ‘Did she say might expect see her again?’ I demanded. ‘No, Mas’r Davy,’ he returned, drawing his hand thoughtfully his face. ‘I asked too; (she said) she could tell.’ As I long forborne encourage hopes hung threads, I made comment information I supposed he would see her soon. Such speculations engendered within I kept myself, faint enough. I walking alone garden, one evening, fortnight afterwards. I remember evening well. It second Mr. Micawber’s week suspense. There rain day, damp feeling air. The leaves thick upon trees, heavy wet; rain ceased, though sky still dark; hopeful birds singing cheerfully. As I walked fro garden, twilight began close around me, little voices hushed; peculiar silence belongs evening country lightest trees quite still, save occasional droppings boughs, prevailed. There little green perspective trellis-work ivy side cottage, I could see, garden I walking, road house. I happened turn eyes towards place, I thinking many things; I saw figure beyond, dressed plain cloak. It bending eagerly towards me, beckoning. ‘Martha!’ said I, going it. ‘Can come me?’ she inquired, agitated whisper. ‘I him, he home. I wrote he come, left his table hand. They said he would long. I tidings him. Can come directly?’ My answer was, pass gate immediately. She made hasty gesture her hand, entreat patience silence, turned towards London, whence, her dress betokened, she come expeditiously foot. I asked her destination? On her motioning Yes, hasty gesture before, I stopped empty coach coming by, got it. When I asked her coachman drive, she answered, ‘Anywhere near Golden Square! And quick!’--then shrunk corner, one trembling hand her face, making former gesture, she could bear voice. Now much disturbed, dazzled conflicting gleams hope dread, I looked her explanation. But seeing strongly she desired remain quiet, feeling natural inclination too, time, I attempt break silence. We proceeded without word spoken. Sometimes she glanced window, though she thought going slowly, though indeed going fast; otherwise remained exactly first. We alighted one entrances Square she mentioned, I directed coach wait, knowing might occasion it. She laid her hand arm, hurried one sombre streets, several part, houses fair dwellings occupation single families, have, had, long degenerated poor lodgings let rooms. Entering open door one these, releasing arm, she beckoned follow her common staircase, like tributary channel street. The house swarmed inmates. As went up, doors rooms opened people’s heads put out; passed people stairs, coming down. In glancing outside, entered, I seen women children lolling windows flower-pots; seemed attracted curiosity, principally observers looked doors. It broad panelled staircase, massive balustrades dark wood; cornices doors, ornamented carved fruit flowers; broad seats windows. But tokens past grandeur miserably decayed dirty; rot, damp, age, weakened flooring, many places unsound even unsafe. Some attempts made, I noticed, infuse new blood dwindling frame, repairing costly old wood-work common deal; like marriage reduced old noble plebeian pauper, party ill-assorted union shrunk away other. Several back windows staircase darkened wholly blocked up. In remained, scarcely glass; and, crumbling frames bad air seemed always come in, never go out, I saw, glassless windows, houses similar condition, looked giddily wretched yard, common dust-heap mansion. We proceeded top-storey house. Two three times, way, I thought I observed indistinct light skirts female figure going us. As turned ascend last flight stairs us roof, caught full view figure pausing moment, door. Then turned handle, went in. ‘What is this!’ said Martha, whisper. ‘She gone room. I do not know her!’ I knew her. I recognized her amazement, Miss Dartle. I said something effect lady I seen before, words, conductress; scarcely done so, heard her voice room, though not, stood, she saying. Martha, astonished look, repeated her former action, softly led stairs; then, little back-door seemed lock, she pushed open touch, small empty garret low sloping roof, little better cupboard. Between this, room she called hers, small door communication, standing partly open. Here stopped, breathless ascent, she placed her hand lightly lips. I could see, room beyond, pretty large; bed it; common pictures ships upon walls. I could see Miss Dartle, person heard her address. Certainly, companion could not, position best. A dead silence prevailed moments. Martha kept one hand lips, raised listening attitude. ‘It matters little her home,’ said Rosa Dartle haughtily, ‘I know nothing her. It I come see.’ ‘Me?’ replied soft voice. At sound it, thrill went frame. For Emily’s! ‘Yes,’ returned Miss Dartle, ‘I come look you. What? You ashamed face done much?’ The resolute unrelenting hatred her tone, cold stern sharpness, mastered rage, presented her me, I seen her standing light. I saw flashing black eyes, passion-wasted figure; I saw scar, white track cutting her lips, quivering throbbing she spoke. ‘I come see,’ she said, ‘James Steerforth’s fancy; girl ran away him, town-talk commonest people her native place; bold, flaunting, practised companion persons like James Steerforth. I want know thing like.’ There rustle, unhappy girl, she heaped taunts, ran towards door, speaker swiftly interposed herself it. It succeeded moment’s pause. When Miss Dartle spoke again, her set teeth, stamp upon ground. ‘Stay there!’ she said, ‘or I will proclaim house, whole street! If try evade me, I will stop you, it is hair, raise stones you!’ A frightened murmur reply reached ears. A silence succeeded. I know do. Much I desired put end interview, I felt I right present myself; Mr. Peggotty alone see her recover her. Would he never come? I thought impatiently. ‘So!’ said Rosa Dartle, contemptuous laugh, ‘I see her last! Why, he poor creature taken delicate mock-modesty, hanging head!’ ‘Oh, Heaven’s sake, spare me!’ exclaimed Emily. ‘Whoever are, know pitiable story, Heaven’s sake spare me, would spared yourself!’ ‘If I would spared!’ returned fiercely; ‘what common US, think!’ ‘Nothing sex,’ said Emily, burst tears. ‘And that,’ said Rosa Dartle, ‘is strong claim, preferred one infamous, I feeling breast scorn abhorrence you, would freeze up. Our sex! You honour sex!’ ‘I deserved this,’ said Emily, ‘but it is dreadful! Dear, dear lady, think I suffered, I fallen! Oh, Martha, come back! Oh, home, home!’ Miss Dartle placed herself chair, within view door, looked downward, Emily crouching floor her. Being light, I could see her curled lip, her cruel eyes intently fixed one place, greedy triumph. ‘Listen I say!’ she said; ‘and reserve false arts dupes. Do hope move tears? No could charm smiles, purchased slave.’ ‘Oh, mercy me!’ cried Emily. ‘Show compassion, I shall die mad!’ ‘It would great penance,’ said Rosa Dartle, ‘for crimes. Do know done? Do ever think home laid waste?’ ‘Oh, ever night day, I do not think it!’ cried Emily; I could see her, her knees, her head thrown back, her pale face looking upward, her hands wildly clasped held out, her hair streaming her. ‘Has ever single minute, waking sleeping, has not me, used lost days I turned back upon ever ever! Oh, home, home! Oh dear, dear uncle, ever could known agony love would I fell away good, never would shown constant, much felt it; would angry me, least life, I might comfort! I none, none, comfort upon earth, always fond me!’ She dropped her face, imperious figure chair, imploring effort clasp skirt her dress. Rosa Dartle sat looking upon her, inflexible figure brass. Her lips tightly compressed, she knew she must keep strong constraint upon herself--I write I sincerely believe--or she would tempted strike beautiful form her foot. I saw her, distinctly, whole power her face character seemed forced expression.---Would he never come? ‘The miserable vanity earth-worms!’ she said, she far controlled angry heavings her breast, she could trust herself speak. ‘YOUR home! Do imagine I bestow thought it, suppose could harm low place, money would pay for, handsomely? YOUR home! You part trade home, bought sold like vendible thing people dealt in.’ ‘Oh, that!’ cried Emily. ‘Say anything me; do not visit disgrace shame, I done, folks honourable you! Have respect them, lady, mercy me.’ ‘I speak,’ she said, deigning take heed appeal, drawing away her dress contamination Emily’s touch, ‘I speak HIS home--where I live. Here,’ she said, stretching her hand her contemptuous laugh, looking upon prostrate girl, ‘is worthy division lady-mother gentleman-son; grief house she would not admitted kitchen-girl; anger, repining, reproach. This piece pollution, picked water-side, made much hour, tossed back her original place!’ ‘No! no!’ cried Emily, clasping her hands together. ‘When he first came way--that day never dawned upon me, he met carried grave!--I brought virtuous lady, going wife good man lady world ever marry. If live his home know him, know, perhaps, his power weak, vain girl might be. I do not defend myself, I know well, he knows well, he know he comes die, his mind troubled it, he used his power deceive me, I believed him, trusted him, loved him!’ Rosa Dartle sprang her seat; recoiled; recoiling struck her, face malignity, darkened disfigured passion, I almost thrown them. The blow, aim, fell upon air. As she stood panting, looking her utmost detestation she capable expressing, trembling head foot rage scorn, I thought I never seen sight, never could see another. ‘YOU love him? You?’ she cried, her clenched hand, quivering wanted weapon stab object her wrath. Emily shrunk view. There reply. ‘And tell ME,’ she added, ‘with shameful lips? Why do not whip creatures? If I could order done, I would girl whipped death.’ And she would, I doubt. I would trusted her rack itself, furious look lasted. She slowly, slowly, broke laugh, pointed Emily her hand, she sight shame gods men. ‘SHE love!’ she said. ‘THAT carrion! And he ever cared her, she would tell me. Ha, ha! The liars traders are!’ Her mockery worse her undisguised rage. Of two, I would much preferred object latter. But, she suffered break loose, moment. She chained again, however might tear her within, she subdued herself. ‘I came here, pure fountain love,’ she said, ‘to see--as I began telling you--what thing like. I curious. I satisfied. Also tell you, best seek home yours, speed, hide head among excellent people expecting you, money console. When it is gone, believe, trust, love again, know! I thought broken toy lasted time; worthless spangle tarnished, thrown away. But, finding true gold, lady, ill-used innocent, fresh heart full love trustfulness--which look like, quite consistent story!--I something say. Attend it; I say I will do. Do hear me, fairy spirit? What I say, I mean do!’ Her rage got better her again, moment; passed her face like spasm, left her smiling. ‘Hide yourself,’ she pursued, ‘if home, somewhere. Let somewhere beyond reach; obscure life--or, better still, obscure death. I wonder, loving heart break, found way helping still! I heard means sometimes. I believe may easily found.’ A low crying, part Emily, interrupted her here. She stopped, listened music. ‘I strange nature, perhaps,’ Rosa Dartle went on; ‘but I cannot breathe freely air breathe. I find sickly. Therefore, I cleared; I purified you. If live tomorrow, I will story character proclaimed common stair. There decent women house, I told; pity light among them, concealed. If, leaving here, seek refuge town character true one (which welcome bear, without molestation me), service shall done you, I hear retreat. Being assisted gentleman long ago aspired favour hand, I sanguine that.’ Would he never, never come? How long I bear this? How long could I bear it? ‘Oh me, oh me!’ exclaimed wretched Emily, tone might touched hardest heart, I thought; relenting Rosa Dartle’s smile. ‘What, what, shall I do!’ ‘Do?’ returned other. ‘Live happy reflections! Consecrate existence recollection James Steerforth’s tenderness--he would made his serving-man’s wife, would he not?---or feeling grateful upright deserving creature would taken his gift. Or, proud remembrances, consciousness virtues, honourable position raised eyes everything wears human shape, sustain you, marry good man, happy his condescension. If either, die! There doorways dust-heaps deaths, despair--find one, take flight Heaven!’ I heard distant foot upon stairs. I knew it, I certain. It his, thank God! She moved slowly door she said this, passed sight. ‘But mark!’ she added, slowly sternly, opening door go away, ‘I resolved, reasons I hatreds I entertain, cast out, unless withdraw reach altogether, drop pretty mask. This I say; I say, I mean do!’ The foot upon stairs came nearer--nearer--passed her she went down--rushed room! ‘Uncle!’ A fearful cry followed word. I paused moment, looking in, saw supporting her insensible figure his arms. He gazed seconds face; stooped kiss it--oh, tenderly!--and drew handkerchief it. ‘Mas’r Davy,’ he said, low tremulous voice, covered, ‘I thank Heav’nly Father dream’s come true! I thank Him hearty guided me, His ways, darling!’ With words he took her his arms; and, veiled face lying his bosom, addressed towards his own, carried her, motionless unconscious, stairs. CHAPTER 51. THE BEGINNING OF A LONGER JOURNEY It yet early morning following day, when, I walking garden aunt (who took little exercise now, much attendance dear Dora), I told Mr. Peggotty desired speak me. He came garden meet half-way, going towards gate; bared his head, always his custom he saw aunt, he high respect. I telling her happened overnight. Without saying word, she walked cordial face, shook hands him, patted arm. It expressively done, she need say word. Mr. Peggotty understood her quite well she said thousand. ‘I will go now, Trot,’ said aunt, ‘and look Little Blossom, getting presently.’ ‘Not along heer, madam, I hope?’ said Mr. Peggotty. ‘Unless wits gone bahd’s neezing’--by Mr. Peggotty meant say, bird’s-nesting--‘this morning, ‘it is along you are a-going quit us?’ ‘You something say, good friend,’ returned aunt, ‘and better without me.’ ‘By leave, madam,’ returned Mr. Peggotty, ‘I take kind, pervising doen’t mind clicketten, you would bide heer.’ ‘Would you?’ said aunt, short good-nature. ‘Then I sure I will!’ So, she drew her arm Mr. Peggotty’s, walked leafy little summer-house bottom garden, she sat bench, I beside her. There seat Mr. Peggotty too, he preferred stand, leaning his hand small rustic table. As he stood, looking his cap little beginning speak, I could help observing power force character his sinewy hand expressed, good trusty companion his honest brow iron-grey hair. ‘I took dear child away last night,’ Mr. Peggotty began, he raised his eyes ours, ‘to lodging, wheer I long time expecting her preparing fur her. It hours afore she knowed right; she did, she kneeled feet, kiender said me, her prayers, come be. You may believe me, I heerd her voice, I heerd home playful--and see her humbled, might dust Saviour wrote his blessed hand--I felt wownd go ‘art, midst thankfulness.’ He drew his sleeve across his face, without pretence concealing why; cleared his voice. ‘It warn’t long I felt that; she found. I on’y think she found, gone. I doen’t know I much mention now, I am sure. I did not mind minute ago, say word myself; come nat’ral, I yielded afore I aweer.’ ‘You self-denying soul,’ said aunt, ‘and reward.’ Mr. Peggotty, shadows leaves playing athwart his face, made surprised inclination head towards aunt, acknowledgement her good opinion; took thread he relinquished. ‘When Them’ly took flight,’ he said, stern wrath moment, ‘from house wheer she made prisoner theer spotted snake Mas’r Davy see,--and his story’s trew, may GOD confound him!--she took flight night. It dark night, many stars a-shining. She wild. She ran along sea beach, believing old boat theer; calling us turn away faces, she a-coming by. She heerd herself a-crying out, like another person; cut herself sharp-pinted stones rocks, felt she rock herself. Ever fur she run, fire afore her eyes, roarings her ears. Of sudden--or she thowt, unnerstand--the day broke, wet windy, she lying b’low heap stone upon shore, woman a-speaking her, saying, language country, gone much amiss?’ He saw everything he related. It passed him, he spoke, vividly, that, intensity his earnestness, he presented he described me, greater distinctness I express. I hardly believe, writing long afterwards, I actually present scenes; impressed upon astonishing air fidelity. ‘As Them’ly’s eyes--which heavy--see woman better,’ Mr. Peggotty went on, ‘she know’d she one she often talked beach. Fur, though she run (as I said) ever fur night, she oftentimes wandered long ways, partly afoot, partly boats carriages, know’d country, ‘long coast, miles miles. She had not children her own, woman, young wife; she a-looking one afore long. And may prayers go Heaven ‘twill happiness her, comfort, honour, her life! May love her dootiful her, her old age; helpful her last; Angel her heer, heerafter!’ ‘Amen!’ said aunt. ‘She summat timorous down,’ said Mr. Peggotty, ‘and sat, first, little way off, her spinning, work was, Them’ly talked children. But Them’ly took notice her, gone spoke her; young woman partial children herself, soon made friends. Sermuchser, Them’ly went way, she always giv Them’ly flowers. This her asked gone much amiss. Them’ly told her, she--took her home. She indeed. She took her home,’ said Mr. Peggotty, covering his face. He affected act kindness, I ever seen affected anything since night she went away. My aunt I attempt disturb him. ‘It little cottage, may suppose,’ he said, presently, ‘but she found space Them’ly it,--her husband away sea,--and she kep secret, prevailed upon neighbours she (they many near) keep secret too. Them’ly took bad fever, and, strange is,--maybe ‘it is strange scholars,--the language country went her head, she could speak her own, one unnerstood. She recollects, she dreamed it, she lay always a-talking her tongue, always believing old boat round next pint bay, begging imploring ‘them send theer tell she dying, bring back message forgiveness, on’y wured. A’most whole time, she thowt,--now, I made mention lurking her unnerneath winder; brought her room,--and cried good young woman give her up, know’d, time, she could not unnerstand, dreaded she must took away. Likewise fire afore her eyes, roarings her ears; theer today, yesterday, yet tomorrow; everything her life ever been, ever could be, everything never been, never could be, crowding her once, nothing clear welcome, yet she sang laughed it! How long lasted, I doen’t know; theer come sleep; sleep, many times stronger her self, she fell weakness littlest child.’ Here he stopped, relief terrors his description. After silent moments, he pursued his story. ‘It pleasant arternoon she awoke; quiet, warn’t sound rippling blue sea without tide, upon shore. It her belief, first, she home upon Sunday morning; vine leaves she see winder, hills beyond, warn’t home, contradicted her. Then, come her friend watch alongside her bed; she know’d old boat warn’t round next pint bay more, fur off; know’d she was, why; broke a-crying good young woman’s bosom, wheer I hope her baby a-lying now, a-cheering her pretty eyes!’ He could speak good friend Emily’s without flow tears. It vain try. He broke again, endeavouring bless her! ‘That done Them’ly good,’ he resumed, emotion I could behold without sharing in; aunt, she wept her heart; ‘that done Them’ly good, she begun mend. But, language country quite gone her, she forced make signs. So she went on, getting better day day, slow, sure, trying learn names common things--names she seemed never heerd her life--till one evening come, she a-setting her window, looking little girl play upon beach. And sudden child held her hand, said, would English, “Fisherman’s daughter, here is she will!”--for unnerstand used first call her “Pretty lady”, general way country is, she taught ‘them call her “Fisherman’s daughter” instead. The child says sudden, “Fisherman’s daughter, here is she will!” Then Them’ly unnerstands her; she answers, bursting a-crying; comes back! ‘When Them’ly got strong again,’ said Mr. Peggotty, another short interval silence, ‘she cast leave good young creetur, get her country. The husband come home, then; two together put her aboard small trader bound Leghorn, France. She little money, less little would take done. I am a’most glad it, though poor! What done, laid wheer neither moth rust doth corrupt, wheer thieves break steal. Mas’r Davy, it will outlast treasure wureld. ‘Them’ly got France, took service wait travelling ladies inn port. Theer, theer come, one day, snake. --Let never come nigh me. I doen’t know hurt I might him!--Soon she see him, without seeing her, her fear wildness returned upon her, she fled afore breath he draw’d. She come England, set ashore Dover. ‘I doen’t know,’ said Mr. Peggotty, ‘for sure, her ‘art begun fail her; way England she thowt come her dear home. Soon she got England she turned her face tow’rds it. But, fear forgiv, fear pinted at, fear us dead along her, fear many things, turned her it, kiender force, upon road: “Uncle, uncle,” she says me, “the fear worthy torn bleeding breast longed do, fright’ning fear all! I turned back, ‘art full prayers I might crawl old door-step, night, kiss it, lay wicked face upon it, theer found dead morning.” ‘She come,’ said Mr. Peggotty, dropping his voice awe-stricken whisper, ‘to London. She--as never seen her life--alone--without penny--young--so pretty--come London. A’most moment she lighted heer, desolate, she found (as she believed) friend; decent woman spoke her needle-work she brought do, finding plenty fur her, lodging fur night, making secret inquiration concerning home, tomorrow. When child,’ he said aloud, energy gratitude shook head foot, ‘stood upon brink I say think on--Martha, trew her promise, saved her.’ I could repress cry joy. ‘Mas’r Davy!’ said he, gripping hand strong hand his, ‘it first made mention her me. I thankee, sir! She arnest. She know’d her bitter knowledge wheer watch do. She done it. And Lord all! She come, white hurried, upon Them’ly her sleep. She says her, “Rise worse death, come me!” Them belonging house would stopped her, might soon stopped sea. “Stand away me,” she says, “I ghost calls her beside her open grave!” She told Them’ly she seen me, know’d I loved her, forgive her. She wrapped her, hasty, her clothes. She took her, faint trembling, her arm. She heeded said, she ears. She walked among ‘them child, minding her; brought her safe out, dead night, black pit ruin! ‘She attended Them’ly,’ said Mr. Peggotty, released hand, put his hand his heaving chest; ‘she attended Them’ly, lying wearied out, wandering betwixt whiles, till late next day. Then she went search me; search you, Mas’r Davy. She did not tell Them’ly she come fur, lest her ‘art fail, she think hiding herself. How cruel lady know’d her theer, I cannot say. Whether I spoke much of, chanced see ‘them going theer, whether (which like, thinking) he heerd woman, I doen’t greatly ask myself. My niece found. ‘All night long,’ said Mr. Peggotty, ‘we together, Them’ly me. ‘It Is little (considering time) she said, wureds, broken-hearted tears; ‘it is less I seen her dear face, grow’d woman’s hearth. But, night long, her arms neck; her head laid heer; knows full well, put trust one another, ever more.’ He ceased speak, his hand upon table rested perfect repose, resolution might conquered lions. ‘It gleam light upon me, Trot,’ said aunt, drying her eyes, ‘when I formed resolution godmother sister Betsey Trotwood, disappointed me; but, next that, hardly anything would given greater pleasure, godmother good young creature’s baby!’ Mr. Peggotty nodded his understanding aunt’s feelings, could trust verbal reference subject her commendation. We remained silent, occupied reflections (my aunt drying her eyes, sobbing convulsively, laughing calling herself fool); I spoke. ‘You quite made mind,’ said I Mr. Peggotty, ‘as future, good friend? I need scarcely ask you.’ ‘Quite, Mas’r Davy,’ he returned; ‘and told Them’ly. Theer’s mighty countries, fur heer. Our future life lays sea.’ ‘They emigrate together, aunt,’ said I. ‘Yes!’ said Mr. Peggotty, hopeful smile. ‘No one cannot reproach darling Australia. We begin new life theer!’ I asked he yet proposed time going away. ‘I Docks early morning, sir,’ he returned, ‘to get information concerning ships. In six weeks two months now, there will one sailing--I see her morning--went aboard--and shall take passage her.’ ‘Quite alone?’ I asked. ‘Aye, Mas’r Davy!’ he returned. ‘My sister, see, she is fond yourn, accustomed think on’y her country, would not hardly fair let her go. Besides which, theer’s one she charge, Mas’r Davy, doen’t ought forgot.’ ‘Poor Ham!’ said I. ‘My good sister takes care his house, see, madam, he takes kindly her,’ Mr. Peggotty explained aunt’s better information. ‘He will set talk her, calm spirit, wen it is like he could not bring open his lips another. Poor fellow!’ said Mr. Peggotty, shaking his head, ‘theer’s much left him, he could spare little he has!’ ‘And Mrs. Gummidge?’ said I. ‘Well, I have mort consideration, I tell you,’ returned Mr. Peggotty, perplexed look gradually cleared he went on, ‘concerning Missis Gummidge. You see, wen Missis Gummidge falls a-thinking old ‘un, she an’t may call good company. Betwixt me, Mas’r Davy--and you, madam--wen Mrs. Gummidge takes wimicking,’--our old country word crying,--‘she is liable considered be, did not know old ‘un, peevish-like. Now I DID know old ‘un,’ said Mr. Peggotty, ‘and I know’d his merits, I unnerstan’ her; ‘tan’t entirely so, see, others--nat’rally cannot be!’ My aunt I acquiesced. ‘Wheerby,’ said Mr. Peggotty, ‘my sister might--I doen’t say she would, might--find Missis Gummidge give her leetle trouble now-and-again. Theerfur ‘tan’t intentions moor Missis Gummidge ‘long them, find Beein’ fur her wheer she fisherate herself.’ (A Beein’ signifies, dialect, home, fisherate provide.) ‘Fur purpose,’ said Mr. Peggotty, ‘I means make her ‘lowance afore I go, as’ll leave her pretty comfort’ble. She is faithfullest creeturs. ‘Tan’t expected, course, her time life, lone lorn, good old Mawther knocked aboardship, woods wilds new fur-away country. So that is I am a-going her.’ He forgot nobody. He thought everybody’s claims strivings, his own. ‘Them’ly,’ he continued, ‘will keep along me--poor child, she is sore need peace rest!--until time goes upon voyage. She will work clothes, must made; I hope her troubles begin seem longer ago was, wen she finds herself her rough loving uncle.’ My aunt nodded confirmation hope, imparted great satisfaction Mr. Peggotty. ‘Theer’s one thing furder, Mas’r Davy,’ said he, putting his hand his breast-pocket, gravely taking little paper bundle I seen before, he unrolled table. ‘Theer’s banknotes--fifty pound, ten. To I wish add money she come away with. I have asked her (but saying why), added up. I an’t scholar. Would kind see ‘it is?’ He handed me, apologetically his scholarship, piece paper, observed I looked over. It quite right. ‘Thankee, sir,’ he said, taking back. ‘This money, doen’t see objections, Mas’r Davy, I shall put jest afore I go, cover directed him; put another, directed his mother. I shall tell her, wureds I speak you, it is price on; I am gone, past receiving back.’ I told I thought would right so--that I thoroughly convinced would be, since he felt right. ‘I said theer on’y one thing furder,’ he proceeded grave smile, he made his little bundle again, put his pocket; ‘but theer two. I warn’t sure mind, wen I come morning, I could go break Ham, self, thankfully happened. So I writ letter I out, put post-office, telling ‘them ‘it is; I come tomorrow unload mind little needs a-doing theer, and, most-like, take farewell leave Yarmouth.’ ‘And wish go you?’ said I, seeing he left something unsaid. ‘If could kind favour, Mas’r Davy,’ he replied. ‘I know sight would cheer ‘them bit.’ My little Dora good spirits, desirous I go--as I found talking her--I readily pledged accompany accordance his wish. Next morning, consequently, Yarmouth coach, travelling old ground. As passed along familiar street night--Mr. Peggotty, despite remonstrances, carrying bag--I glanced Omer Joram’s shop, saw old friend Mr. Omer there, smoking his pipe. I felt reluctant present, Mr. Peggotty first met his sister Ham; made Mr. Omer excuse lingering behind. ‘How Mr. Omer, long time?’ said I, going in. He fanned away smoke his pipe, he might get better view me, soon recognized great delight. ‘I get up, sir, acknowledge honour visit,’ said he, ‘only limbs rather sorts, I wheeled about. With exception limbs breath, howsoever, I hearty man be, I am thankful say.’ I congratulated his contented looks his good spirits, saw, now, his easy-chair went wheels. ‘It is ingenious thing, are not it?’ he inquired, following direction glance, polishing elbow his arm. ‘It runs light feather, tracks true mail-coach. Bless you, little Minnie--my grand-daughter know, Minnie’s child--puts her little strength back, gives shove, away go, clever merry ever see anything! And I tell what--it is uncommon chair smoke pipe in.’ I never saw good old fellow make best thing, find enjoyment it, Mr. Omer. He radiant, his chair, his asthma, failure his limbs, various branches great invention enhancing luxury pipe. ‘I see world, I assure you,’ said Mr. Omer, ‘in chair, ever I see it. You would surprised number people looks day chat. You really would! There is twice much newspaper, since I have taken chair, used be. As general reading, dear me, lot I get through! That is I feel strong, know! If eyes, I done? If ears, I done? Being limbs, signify? Why, limbs made breath shorter I used ‘them. And now, I want go street sands, I have got call Dick, Joram’s youngest ‘prentice, away I go carriage, like Lord Mayor London.’ He half suffocated laughing here. ‘Lord bless you!’ said Mr. Omer, resuming his pipe, ‘a man must take fat lean; that is he must make his mind to, life. Joram fine business. Ex-cellent business!’ ‘I glad hear it,’ said I. ‘I knew would be,’ said Mr. Omer. ‘And Joram Minnie like Valentines. What man expect? What is his limbs that!’ His supreme contempt his limbs, he sat smoking, one pleasantest oddities I ever encountered. ‘And since I have took general reading, you have took general writing, eh, sir?’ said Mr. Omer, surveying admiringly. ‘What lovely work yours! What expressions it! I read every word--every word. And feeling sleepy! Not all!’ I laughingly expressed satisfaction, I must confess I thought association ideas significant. ‘I give word honour, sir,’ said Mr. Omer, ‘that I lay book upon table, look outside; compact three separate indiwidual wollumes--one, two, three; I proud Punch think I honour connected family. And dear me, it is long time ago, now, are not it? Over Blunderstone. With pretty little party laid along party. And quite small party then, yourself. Dear, dear!’ I changed subject referring Emily. After assuring I forget interested he always her, kindly he always treated her, I gave general account her restoration her uncle aid Martha; I knew would please old man. He listened utmost attention, said, feelingly, I done: ‘I rejoiced it, sir! It is best news I heard many day. Dear, dear, dear! And what is going undertook unfortunate young woman, Martha, now?’ ‘You touch point thoughts dwelling since yesterday,’ said I, ‘but I give information yet, Mr. Omer. Mr. Peggotty alluded it, I delicacy so. I sure he forgotten it. He forgets nothing disinterested good.’ ‘Because know,’ said Mr. Omer, taking up, he left off, ‘whatever done, I wish member of. Put anything may consider right, let know. I never could think girl bad, I glad find she is not. So daughter Minnie be. Young women contradictory creatures things--her mother her--but hearts soft kind. It is show Minnie, Martha. Why she consider necessary make show, I do not undertake tell you. But it is show, bless you. She would her kindness private. So, put whatever may consider right, good? drop line forward it. Dear me!’ said Mr. Omer, ‘when man drawing time life, two ends life meet; he finds himself, however hearty he is, wheeled second time, speeches go-cart; he over-rejoiced kindness he can. He wants plenty. And I do not speak myself, particular,’ said Mr. Omer, ‘because, sir, way I look is, drawing bottom hill, whatever age are, account time never standing still single moment. So let us always kindness, over-rejoiced. To sure!’ He knocked ashes his pipe, put ledge back his chair, expressly made reception. ‘There is Them’ly’s cousin, she married to,’ said Mr. Omer, rubbing his hands feebly, ‘as fine fellow Yarmouth! He will come talk read me, evening, hour together sometimes. That is kindness, I call it! All his life’s kindness.’ ‘I going see now,’ said I. ‘Are you?’ said Mr. Omer. ‘Tell I hearty, sent respects. Minnie Joram’s ball. They would proud see I am, home. Minnie will not hardly go all, see, “on account father”, she says. So I swore tonight, she did not go, I would go bed six. In consequence which,’ Mr. Omer shook his chair laughter success his device, ‘she Joram’s ball.’ I shook hands him, wished good night. ‘Half minute, sir,’ said Mr. Omer. ‘If go without seeing little elephant, you would lose best sights. You never see sight! Minnie!’ A musical little voice answered, somewhere upstairs, ‘I coming, grandfather!’ pretty little girl long, flaxen, curling hair, soon came running shop. ‘This little elephant, sir,’ said Mr. Omer, fondling child. ‘Siamese breed, sir. Now, little elephant!’ The little elephant set door parlour open, enabling see that, latter days, converted bedroom Mr. Omer could easily conveyed upstairs; hid her pretty forehead, tumbled her long hair, back Mr. Omer’s chair. ‘The elephant butts, know, sir,’ said Mr. Omer, winking, ‘when he goes object. Once, elephant. Twice. Three times!’ At signal, little elephant, dexterity next marvellous small animal, whisked chair round Mr. Omer it, rattled off, pell-mell, parlour, without touching door-post: Mr. Omer indescribably enjoying performance, looking back road triumphant issue his life’s exertions. After stroll town I went Ham’s house. Peggotty removed good; let her house successor Mr. Barkis carrying business, paid her well good-will, cart, horse. I believe slow horse Mr. Barkis drove still work. I found neat kitchen, accompanied Mrs. Gummidge, fetched old boat Mr. Peggotty himself. I doubt she could induced desert her post, anyone else. He evidently told all. Both Peggotty Mrs. Gummidge aprons eyes, Ham stepped ‘to take turn beach’. He presently came home, glad see me; I hope better there. We spoke, approach cheerfulness, Mr. Peggotty’s growing rich new country, wonders he would describe his letters. We said nothing Emily name, distantly referred her once. Ham serenest party. But, Peggotty told me, she lighted little chamber Crocodile book lying ready table, he always same. She believed (she told me, crying) he broken-hearted; though he full courage sweetness, worked harder better boat-builder yard part. There times, she said, evening, he talked old life boat-house; he mentioned Emily child. But, he never mentioned her woman. I thought I read his face he would like speak alone. I therefore resolved put his way next evening, he came home his work. Having settled myself, I fell asleep. That night, first time many nights, candle taken window, Mr. Peggotty swung his old hammock old boat, wind murmured old sound round his head. All next day, he occupied disposing his fishing-boat tackle; packing up, sending London waggon, his little domestic possessions he thought would useful him; parting rest, bestowing Mrs. Gummidge. She day. As I sorrowful wish see old place more, locked up, I engaged meet evening. But I arranged it, I meet Ham first. It easy come his way, I knew he worked. I met retired part sands, I knew he would cross, turned back him, he might leisure speak he really wished. I mistaken expression his face. We walked little way together, he said, without looking me: ‘Mas’r Davy, seen her?’ ‘Only moment, she swoon,’ I softly answered. We walked little farther, he said: ‘Mas’r Davy, shall see her, d’ye think?’ ‘It would painful her, perhaps,’ said I. ‘I thowt that,’ he replied. ‘So ‘twould, sir, ‘twould.’ ‘But, Ham,’ said I, gently, ‘if anything I could write her, you, case I could tell it; anything would wish make known her me; I consider sacred trust.’ ‘I sure on’t. I thankee, sir, kind! I think theer something I could wish said wrote.’ ‘What it?’ We walked little farther silence, he spoke. ‘’Tan’t I forgive her. ‘Tan’t much. ‘It Is I beg her forgive me, pressed affections upon her. Odd times, I think I had not her promise fur marry me, sir, she trustful me, friendly way, she would told struggling her mind, would counselled me, I might saved her.’ I pressed his hand. ‘Is all?’ ‘Theer’s yet something else,’ he returned, ‘if I say it, Mas’r Davy.’ We walked on, farther walked yet, he spoke again. He crying he made pauses I shall express lines. He merely collecting speak plainly. ‘I loved her--and I love mem’ry her--too deep--to able lead her believe self I am happy man. I could happy--by forgetting her--and I am afeerd I could not hardly bear she told I done that. But you, full learning, Mas’r Davy, could think anything say might bring her believe I was not greatly hurt: still loving her, mourning her: anything might bring her believe I tired life, yet hoping fur see her without blame, wheer wicked cease troubling weary rest--anything would ease her sorrowful mind, yet make her think I could ever marry, ‘it was possible anyone could ever she was--I ask say that--with prayers her--that dear.’ I pressed his manly hand again, told I would charge well I could. ‘I thankee, sir,’ he answered. ‘It Was kind meet me. ‘It Was kind bear company down. Mas’r Davy, I unnerstan’ well, though aunt come Lon’on afore sail, they will unite more, I like see agen. I fare feel sure on’t. We doen’t say so, ‘twill be, better so. The last see him--the last--will give lovingest duty thanks orphan, he ever father to?’ This I also promised, faithfully. ‘I thankee agen, sir,’ he said, heartily shaking hands. ‘I know wheer you are a-going. Good-bye!’ With slight wave his hand, though explain he could enter old place, he turned away. As I looked his figure, crossing waste moonlight, I saw turn his face towards strip silvery light upon sea, pass on, looking it, he shadow distance. The door boat-house stood open I approached; and, entering, I found emptied furniture, saving one old lockers, Mrs. Gummidge, basket her knee, seated, looking Mr. Peggotty. He leaned his elbow rough chimney-piece, gazed upon expiring embers grate; he raised his head, hopefully, coming in, spoke cheery manner. ‘Come, according promise, bid farewell ‘t, eh, Mas’r Davy?’ he said, taking candle. ‘Bare enough, now, an’t it?’ ‘Indeed made good use time,’ said I. ‘Why, idle, sir. Missis Gummidge worked like a--I doen’t know Missis Gummidge an’t worked like,’ said Mr. Peggotty, looking her, loss sufficiently approving simile. Mrs. Gummidge, leaning her basket, made observation. ‘Theer’s locker used sit on, ‘long Them’ly!’ said Mr. Peggotty, whisper. ‘I am a-going carry away me, last all. And heer’s old little bedroom, see, Mas’r Davy! A’most bleak tonight, ‘art could wish!’ In truth, wind, though low, solemn sound, crept around deserted house whispered wailing mournful. Everything gone, little mirror oyster-she will frame. I thought myself, lying here, first great change wrought home. I thought blue-eyed child enchanted me. I thought Steerforth: foolish, fearful fancy came upon his near hand, liable met turn. ‘It Is like long,’ said Mr. Peggotty, low voice, ‘afore boat finds new tenants. They look upon ‘t, heer, unfortunate now!’ ‘Does belong anybody neighbourhood?’ I asked. ‘To mast-maker town,’ said Mr. Peggotty. ‘I am a-going give key tonight.’ We looked little room, came back Mrs. Gummidge, sitting locker, Mr. Peggotty, putting light chimney-piece, requested rise, he might carry outside door extinguishing candle. ‘Dan’l,’ said Mrs. Gummidge, suddenly deserting her basket, clinging his arm ‘my dear Dan’l, parting words I speak house is, I must not left behind. Doen’t ye think leaving behind, Dan’l! Oh, doen’t ye ever it!’ Mr. Peggotty, taken aback, looked Mrs. Gummidge me, Mrs. Gummidge, he awakened sleep. ‘Doen’t ye, dearest Dan’l, doen’t ye!’ cried Mrs. Gummidge, fervently. ‘Take ‘long you, Dan’l, take ‘long Them’ly! I will servant, constant trew. If there is slaves parts you are a-going, I will bound one, happy, doen’t ye leave behind, Dan’l, that is deary dear!’ ‘My good soul,’ said Mr. Peggotty, shaking his head, ‘you doen’t know long voyage, hard life ‘it is!’ ‘Yes, I do, Dan’l! I guess!’ cried Mrs. Gummidge. ‘But parting words roof is, I shall go house die, I took. I dig, Dan’l. I work. I live hard. I loving patient now--more think, Dan’l, you will on’y try me. I would not touch ‘lowance, I dying want, Dan’l Peggotty; I will go Them’ly, you will on’y let me, world’s end! I know ‘it is; I know think I lone lorn; but, deary love, ‘tan’t more! I are not sat here, long, a-watching, a-thinking trials, without good done me. Mas’r Davy, speak me! I knows his ways, Them’ly’s, I knows sorrows, comfort ‘them, odd times, labour ‘them allus! Dan’l, deary Dan’l, let go ‘long you!’ And Mrs. Gummidge took his hand, kissed homely pathos affection, homely rapture devotion gratitude, he well deserved. We brought locker out, extinguished candle, fastened door outside, left old boat close shut up, dark speck cloudy night. Next day, returning London outside coach, Mrs. Gummidge her basket seat behind, Mrs. Gummidge happy. CHAPTER 52. I ASSIST AT AN EXPLOSION When time Mr. Micawber appointed mysteriously, within four-and-twenty hours come, aunt I consulted proceed; aunt unwilling leave Dora. Ah! easily I carried Dora stairs, now! We disposed, notwithstanding Mr. Micawber’s stipulation aunt’s attendance, arrange she stay home, represented Mr. Dick me. In short, resolved take course, Dora unsettled us declaring she never would forgive herself, never would forgive her bad boy, aunt remained behind, pretence. ‘I will not speak you,’ said Dora, shaking her curls aunt. ‘I will disagreeable! I will make Jip bark day. I shall sure really cross old thing, do not go!’ ‘Tut, Blossom!’ laughed aunt. ‘You know cannot without me!’ ‘Yes, I can,’ said Dora. ‘You use all. You never run stairs me, day long. You never sit tell stories Doady, his shoes worn out, he covered dust--oh, poor little mite fellow! You never anything please me, you, dear?’ Dora made haste kiss aunt, say, ‘Yes, do! I am joking!’-lest aunt think she really meant it. ‘But, aunt,’ said Dora, coaxingly, ‘now listen. You must go. I shall tease you, ‘till let way it. I shall lead naughty boy life, he do not make go. I shall make disagreeable--and Jip! You will wish gone, like good thing, ever ever long, do not go. Besides,’ said Dora, putting back her hair, looking wonderingly aunt me, ‘why should not go? I ill indeed. Am I?’ ‘Why, question!’ cried aunt. ‘What fancy!’ said I. ‘Yes! I know I silly little thing!’ said Dora, slowly looking one us other, putting her pretty lips kiss us she lay upon her couch. ‘Well, then, must go, I shall believe you; I shall cry!’ I saw, aunt’s face, she began give way now, Dora brightened again, she saw too. ‘You will come back much tell me, it will take least week make understand!’ said Dora. ‘Because I know I shall not understand, length time, there is business it. And there is sure business it! If there is anything add up, besides, I do not know I shall make out; bad boy look miserable time. There! Now you will go, will not you? You will gone one night, Jip take care gone. Doady carry upstairs go, I will not come till come back; shall take Agnes dreadfully scolding letter me, she never see us!’ We agreed, without consultation, would go, Dora little Impostor, feigned rather unwell, she liked petted. She greatly pleased, merry; four, say, aunt, Mr. Dick, Traddles, I, went Canterbury Dover mail night. At hotel Mr. Micawber requested us await him, got into, trouble, middle night, I found letter, importing he would appear morning punctually half past nine. After which, went shivering, uncomfortable hour, respective beds, various close passages; smelt steeped, ages, solution soup stables. Early morning, I sauntered dear old tranquil streets, mingled shadows venerable gateways churches. The rooks sailing cathedral towers; towers themselves, overlooking many long unaltered mile rich country pleasant streams, cutting bright morning air, thing change earth. Yet bells, sounded, told sorrowfully change everything; told age, pretty Dora’s youth; many, never old, lived loved died, reverberations bells hummed rusty armour Black Prince hanging within, and, motes upon deep Time, lost air, circles water. I looked old house corner street, go nearer it, lest, observed, I might unwittingly harm design I come aid. The early sun striking edgewise gables lattice-windows, touching gold; beams old peace seemed touch heart. I strolled country hour so, returned main street, interval shaken last night’s sleep. Among stirring shops, I saw ancient enemy butcher, advanced top-boots baby, business himself. He nursing baby, appeared benignant member society. We became anxious impatient, sat breakfast. As approached nearer nearer half past nine of the clock, restless expectation Mr. Micawber increased. At last made pretence attending meal, which, except Mr. Dick, mere form first; aunt walked room. Traddles sat upon sofa affecting read paper his eyes ceiling; I looked window give early notice Mr. Micawber’s coming. Nor I long watch, for, first chime half hour, he appeared street. ‘Here he is,’ said I, ‘and his legal attire!’ My aunt tied strings her bonnet (she come breakfast it), put her shawl, she ready anything resolute uncompromising. Traddles buttoned his coat determined air. Mr. Dick, disturbed formidable appearances, feeling necessary imitate them, pulled his hat, hands, firmly his ears he possibly could; instantly took again, welcome Mr. Micawber. ‘Gentlemen, madam,’ said Mr. Micawber, ‘good morning! My dear sir,’ Mr. Dick, shook hands violently, ‘you extremely good.’ ‘Have breakfasted?’ said Mr. Dick. ‘Have chop!’ ‘Not world, good sir!’ cried Mr. Micawber, stopping his way bell; ‘appetite myself, Mr. Dixon, long strangers.’ Mr. Dixon well pleased his new name, appeared think obliging Mr. Micawber confer upon him, he shook hands again, laughed rather childishly. ‘Dick,’ said aunt, ‘attention!’ Mr. Dick recovered himself, blush. ‘Now, sir,’ said aunt Mr. Micawber, she put her gloves, ‘we ready Mount Vesuvius, anything else, soon YOU please.’ ‘Madam,’ returned Mr. Micawber, ‘I trust shortly witness eruption. Mr. Traddles, I permission, I believe, mention communication together?’ ‘It undoubtedly fact, Copperfield,’ said Traddles, I looked surprise. ‘Mr. Micawber consulted reference he contemplation; I advised best judgement.’ ‘Unless I deceive myself, Mr. Traddles,’ pursued Mr. Micawber, ‘what I contemplate disclosure important nature.’ ‘Highly so,’ said Traddles. ‘Perhaps, circumstances, madam gentlemen,’ said Mr. Micawber, ‘you favour submit yourselves, moment, direction one who, however unworthy regarded light Waif Stray upon shore human nature, still fellow-man, though crushed his original form individual errors, accumulative force combination circumstances?’ ‘We perfect confidence you, Mr. Micawber,’ said I, ‘and please.’ ‘Mr. Copperfield,’ returned Mr. Micawber, ‘your confidence not, existing juncture, ill-bestowed. I would beg allowed start five minutes clock; receive present company, inquiring Miss Wickfield, office Wickfield Heep, whose Stipendiary I am.’ My aunt I looked Traddles, nodded his approval. ‘I more,’ observed Mr. Micawber, ‘to say present.’ With which, infinite surprise, he included us comprehensive bow, disappeared; his manner extremely distant, his face extremely pale. Traddles smiled, shook his head (with his hair standing upright top it), I looked explanation; I took watch, and, last resource, counted five minutes. My aunt, her watch her hand, like. When time expired, Traddles gave her his arm; went together old house, without saying one word way. We found Mr. Micawber his desk, turret office ground floor, either writing, pretending write, hard. The large office-ruler stuck his waistcoat, well concealed foot instrument protruded his bosom, like new kind shirt-frill. As appeared I expected speak, I said aloud: ‘How do, Mr. Micawber?’ ‘Mr. Copperfield,’ said Mr. Micawber, gravely, ‘I hope I see well?’ ‘Is Miss Wickfield home?’ said I. ‘Mr. Wickfield unwell bed, sir, rheumatic fever,’ he returned; ‘but Miss Wickfield, I doubt, happy see old friends. Will walk in, sir?’ He preceded us dining-room--the first room I entered house--and flinging open door Mr. Wickfield’s former office, said, sonorous voice: ‘Miss Trotwood, Mr. David Copperfield, Mr. Thomas Traddles, Mr. Dixon!’ I seen Uriah Heep since time blow. Our visit astonished him, evidently; less, I dare say, astonished ourselves. He gather his eyebrows together, he none worth mentioning; he frowned degree he almost closed his small eyes, hurried raising his grisly hand his chin betrayed trepidation surprise. This act entering his room, I caught glance aunt’s shoulder. A moment afterwards, he fawning humble ever. ‘Well, I sure,’ he said. ‘This indeed unexpected pleasure! To have, I may say, friends round St. Paul’s once, treat unlooked for! Mr. Copperfield, I hope I see well, and--if I may umbly express so--friendly towards ever friends, whether not. Mrs. Copperfield, sir, I hope she is getting on. We made quite uneasy poor accounts her state, lately, I assure you.’ I felt ashamed let take hand, I know yet else do. ‘Things changed office, Miss Trotwood, since I umble clerk, held pony; are not they?’ said Uriah, his sickliest smile. ‘But I changed, Miss Trotwood.’ ‘Well, sir,’ returned aunt, ‘to tell truth, I think pretty constant promise youth; that is satisfaction you.’ ‘Thank you, Miss Trotwood,’ said Uriah, writhing his ungainly manner, ‘for good opinion! Micawber, tell ‘them let Miss Agnes know--and mother. Mother quite state, she sees present company!’ said Uriah, setting chairs. ‘You busy, Mr. Heep?’ said Traddles, whose eye cunning red eye accidentally caught, scrutinized evaded us. ‘No, Mr. Traddles,’ replied Uriah, resuming his official seat, squeezing his bony hands, laid palm palm his bony knees. ‘Not much I could wish. But lawyers, sharks, leeches, easily satisfied, know! Not Micawber hands pretty full, general, account Mr. Wickfield’s hardly fit occupation, sir. But it is pleasure well duty, I sure, work him. You have intimate Mr. Wickfield, I think, Mr. Traddles? I believe I have honour seeing myself?’ ‘No, I intimate Mr. Wickfield,’ returned Traddles; ‘or I might perhaps waited long ago, Mr. Heep.’ There something tone reply, made Uriah look speaker again, sinister suspicious expression. But, seeing Traddles, his good-natured face, simple manner, hair end, he dismissed he replied, jerk his whole body, especially his throat: ‘I sorry that, Mr. Traddles. You would admired much do. His little failings would endeared more. But would like hear fellow-partner eloquently spoken of, I refer Copperfield. The family subject he is strong upon, never heard him.’ I prevented disclaiming compliment (if I done so, case), entrance Agnes, ushered Mr. Micawber. She quite self-possessed usual, I thought; evidently undergone anxiety fatigue. But her earnest cordiality, her quiet beauty, shone gentler lustre it. I saw Uriah watch her she greeted us; he reminded ugly rebellious genie watching good spirit. In meanwhile, slight sign passed Mr. Micawber Traddles; Traddles, unobserved except me, went out. ‘Do not wait, Micawber,’ said Uriah. Mr. Micawber, his hand upon ruler his breast, stood erect door, unmistakably contemplating one his fellow-men, man his employer. ‘What waiting for?’ said Uriah. ‘Micawber! hear tell wait?’ ‘Yes!’ replied immovable Mr. Micawber. ‘Then DO wait?’ said Uriah. ‘Because I--in short, choose,’ replied Mr. Micawber, burst. Uriah’s cheeks lost colour, unwholesome paleness, still faintly tinged his pervading red, overspread them. He looked Mr. Micawber attentively, his whole face breathing short quick every feature. ‘You dissipated fellow, world knows,’ he said, effort smile, ‘and I afraid you will oblige get rid you. Go along! I will talk presently.’ ‘If scoundrel earth,’ said Mr. Micawber, suddenly breaking utmost vehemence, ‘with I already talked much, scoundrel’s name is--HEEP!’ Uriah fell back, he struck stung. Looking slowly round upon us darkest wickedest expression his face could wear, he said, lower voice: ‘Oho! This conspiracy! You met appointment! You playing Booty clerk, you, Copperfield? Now, take care. You will make nothing this. We understand other, me. There is love us. You always puppy proud stomach, first coming here; envy rise, you? None plots me; I will counterplot you! Micawber, off. I will talk presently.’ ‘Mr. Micawber,’ said I, ‘there sudden change fellow, respects extraordinary one his speaking truth one particular, assures he brought bay. Deal he deserves!’ ‘You precious set people, are not you?’ said Uriah, low voice, breaking clammy heat, he wiped his forehead, his long lean hand, ‘to buy clerk, scum society,--as were, Copperfield, know it, anyone charity you,--to defame his lies? Miss Trotwood, better stop this; I will stop husband shorter pleasant you. I will not know story professionally, nothing, old lady! Miss Wickfield, love father, better join gang. I will ruin him, do. Now, come! I got harrow. Think twice, goes you. Think twice, you, Micawber, do not want crushed. I recommend take off, talked presently, fool! there is time retreat. Where is mother?’ he said, suddenly appearing notice, alarm, absence Traddles, pulling bell-rope. ‘Fine doings person’s house!’ ‘Mrs. Heep here, sir,’ said Traddles, returning worthy mother worthy son. ‘I taken liberty making known her.’ ‘Who make known?’ retorted Uriah. ‘And want here?’ ‘I agent friend Mr. Wickfield, sir,’ said Traddles, composed business-like way. ‘And I power attorney pocket, act matters.’ ‘The old ass drunk state dotage,’ said Uriah, turning uglier before, ‘and got fraud!’ ‘Something got fraud, I know,’ returned Traddles quietly; ‘and you, Mr. Heep. We refer question, please, Mr. Micawber.’ ‘Ury--!’ Mrs. Heep began, anxious gesture. ‘YOU hold tongue, mother,’ he returned; ‘least said, soonest mended.’ ‘But, Ury--’ ‘Will hold tongue, mother, leave me?’ Though I long known his servility false, his pretences knavish hollow, I adequate conception extent his hypocrisy, I saw his mask off. The suddenness he dropped it, he perceived useless him; malice, insolence, hatred, he revealed; leer he exulted, even moment, evil he done--all time desperate too, his wits’ end means getting better us--though perfectly consistent experience I him, first took even surprise, known long, disliked heartily. I say nothing look he conferred me, he stood eyeing us, one another; I always understood he hated me, I remembered marks hand upon his cheek. But his eyes passed Agnes, I saw rage he felt his power her slipping away, exhibition, disappointment, odious passions led aspire one whose virtues he could never appreciate care for, I shocked mere thought her lived, hour, within sight man. After rubbing lower part his face, looking us bad eyes, his grisly fingers, he made one address me, half whining, half abusive. ‘You think justifiable, you, Copperfield, pride much honour rest it, sneak place, eaves-dropping clerk? If ME, I should not wondered; I do not make gentleman (though I never streets either, were, according Micawber), you!--And you are afraid this, either? You do not think I shall do, return; getting trouble conspiracy forth? Very well. We shall see! Mr. What is-your-name, going refer question Micawber. There is referee. Why do not make speak? He learnt his lesson, I see.’ Seeing he said effect us, he sat edge his table his hands his pockets, one his splay feet twisted round leg, waiting doggedly might follow. Mr. Micawber, whose impetuosity I restrained thus far greatest difficulty, repeatedly interposed first syllable SCOUN-drel! without getting second, burst forward, drew ruler his breast (apparently defensive weapon), produced his pocket foolscap document, folded form large letter. Opening packet, his old flourish, glancing contents, he cherished artistic admiration style composition, he began read follows: ‘“Dear Miss Trotwood gentlemen--“’ ‘Bless save man!’ exclaimed aunt low voice. ‘He would write letters ream, capital offence!’ Mr. Micawber, without hearing her, went on. ‘“In appearing denounce probably consummate Villain ever existed,”’ Mr. Micawber, without looking letter, pointed ruler, like ghostly truncheon, Uriah Heep, ‘“I ask consideration myself. The victim, cradle, pecuniary liabilities I unable respond, I ever sport toy debasing circumstances. Ignominy, Want, Despair, Madness, have, collectively separately, attendants career.”’ The relish Mr. Micawber described prey dismal calamities, equalled emphasis he read his letter; kind homage he rendered roll his head, he thought he hit sentence hard indeed. ‘“In accumulation Ignominy, Want, Despair, Madness, I entered office--or, lively neighbour Gaul would term it, Bureau--of Firm, nominally conducted appellation Wickfield and--HEEP, reality, wielded by--HEEP alone. HEEP, HEEP, mainspring machine. HEEP, HEEP, Forger Cheat.”’ Uriah, blue white words, made dart letter, tear pieces. Mr. Micawber, perfect miracle dexterity luck, caught his advancing knuckles ruler, disabled his right hand. It dropped wrist, broken. The blow sounded fallen wood. ‘The Devil take you!’ said Uriah, writhing new way pain. ‘I will even you.’ ‘Approach again, you--you--you HEEP infamy,’ gasped Mr. Micawber, ‘and head human, I will break it. Come on, come on!’ I think I never saw anything ridiculous--I sensible it, even time--than Mr. Micawber making broad-sword guards ruler, crying, ‘Come on!’ Traddles I pushed back corner, which, often got it, he persisted emerging again. His enemy, muttering himself, wringing his wounded hand sometime, slowly drew his neck-kerchief bound up; held his hand, sat upon his table his sullen face looking down. Mr. Micawber, he sufficiently cool, proceeded his letter. ‘“The stipendiary emoluments consideration I entered service of--HEEP,”’ always pausing word uttering astonishing vigour, ‘“were defined, beyond pittance twenty-two shillings six per week. The rest left contingent value professional exertions; expressive words, baseness nature, cupidity motives, poverty family, general moral (or rather immoral) resemblance and--HEEP. Need I say, soon became necessary solicit from--HEEP--pecuniary advances towards support Mrs. Micawber, blighted rising family? Need I say necessity foreseen by--HEEP? That advances secured I.O.YOU.’s similar acknowledgements, known legal institutions country? And I thus became immeshed web he spun reception?”’ Mr. Micawber’s enjoyment his epistolary powers, describing unfortunate state things, really seemed outweigh pain anxiety reality could caused him. He read on: ‘“Then that--HEEP--began favour much his confidence, necessary discharge his infernal business. Then I began, I may Shakespearianly express myself, dwindle, peak, pine. I found services constantly called requisition falsification business, mystification individual I designate Mr. W. That Mr. W. imposed upon, kept ignorance, deluded, every possible way; yet, while, ruffian--HEEP--was professing unbounded gratitude to, unbounded friendship for, much-abused gentleman. This bad enough; but, philosophic Dane observes, universal applicability distinguishes illustrious ornament Elizabethan Era, worse remains behind!”’ Mr. Micawber much struck happy rounding quotation, he indulged himself, us, second reading sentence, pretence lost his place. ‘“It intention,”’ he continued reading on, ‘“to enter detailed list, within compass present epistle (though ready elsewhere), various malpractices minor nature, affecting individual I denominated Mr. W., I tacitly consenting party. My object, contest within stipend stipend, baker baker, existence non-existence, ceased, take advantage opportunities discover expose major malpractices committed, gentleman’s grievous wrong injury, by--HEEP. Stimulated silent monitor within, less touching appealing monitor without--to I briefly refer Miss W.--I entered unlaborious task clandestine investigation, protracted--now, best knowledge, information, belief, period exceeding twelve calendar months.”’ He read passage Act Parliament; appeared majestically refreshed sound words. ‘“My charges against--HEEP,”’ he read on, glancing him, drawing ruler convenient position his left arm, case need, ‘“are follows.”’ We held breath, I think. I sure Uriah held his. ‘“First,”’ said Mr. Micawber, ‘“When Mr. W.’s faculties memory business became, causes necessary expedient enter, weakened confused,--HEEP--designedly perplexed complicated whole official transactions. When Mr. W. least fit enter business,--HEEP always hand force enter it. He obtained Mr. W.’s signature circumstances documents importance, representing documents importance. He induced Mr. W. empower draw out, thus, one particular sum trust-money, amounting twelve six fourteen, two nine, employed meet pretended business charges deficiencies either already provided for, never really existed. He gave proceeding, throughout, appearance originated Mr. W.’s dishonest intention, accomplished Mr. W.’s dishonest act; used it, ever since, torture constrain him.”’ ‘You shall prove this, Copperfield!’ said Uriah, threatening shake head. ‘All good time!’ ‘Ask--HEEP--Mr. Traddles, lived his house him,’ said Mr. Micawber, breaking letter; ‘will you?’ ‘The fool himself--and lives now,’ said Uriah, disdainfully. ‘Ask--HEEP--if he ever kept pocket-book house,’ said Mr. Micawber; ‘will you?’ I saw Uriah’s lank hand stop, involuntarily, scraping his chin. ‘Or ask him,’ said Mr. Micawber, ‘if he ever burnt one there. If he says yes, asks ashes are, refer Wilkins Micawber, he hear something his advantage!’ The triumphant flourish Mr. Micawber delivered words, powerful effect alarming mother; cried out, much agitation: ‘Ury, Ury! Be umble, make terms, dear!’ ‘Mother!’ he retorted, ‘will keep quiet? You are fright, do not know say mean. Umble!’ he repeated, looking me, snarl; ‘I have umbled ‘them pretty long time back, umble I was!’ Mr. Micawber, genteelly adjusting his chin his cravat, presently proceeded his composition. ‘“Second. HEEP has, several occasions, best knowledge, information, belief--“’ ‘But will not do,’ muttered Uriah, relieved. ‘Mother, keep quiet.’ ‘We endeavour provide something WILL do, finally, sir, shortly,’ replied Mr. Micawber. ‘“Second. HEEP has, several occasions, best knowledge, information, belief, systematically forged, various entries, books, documents, signature Mr. W.; distinctly done one instance, capable proof me. To wit, manner following, say:”’ Again, Mr. Micawber relish formal piling words, which, however ludicrously displayed his case, was, I must say, peculiar him. I observed it, course life, numbers men. It seems general rule. In taking legal oaths, instance, deponents seem enjoy mightily come several good words succession, expression one idea; as, utterly detest, abominate, abjure, forth; old anathemas made relishing principle. We talk tyranny words, like tyrannize too; fond large superfluous establishment words wait upon us great occasions; think looks important, sounds well. As particular meaning liveries state occasions, fine numerous enough, so, meaning necessity words secondary consideration, great parade them. And individuals get trouble making great show liveries, slaves numerous rise masters, I think I could mention nation got many great difficulties, get many greater, maintaining large retinue words. Mr. Micawber read on, almost smacking his lips: ‘“To wit, manner following, say. Mr. W. infirm, within bounds probability his decease might lead discoveries, downfall of--HEEP’S--power W. family,--as I, Wilkins Micawber, undersigned, assume--unless filial affection his daughter could secretly influenced allowing investigation partnership affairs ever made, said--HEEP--deemed expedient bond ready him, Mr. W., before-mentioned sum twelve six fourteen, two nine, interest, stated therein advanced by--HEEP--to Mr. W. save Mr. W. dishonour; though really sum never advanced him, long replaced. The signatures instrument purporting executed Mr. W. attested Wilkins Micawber, forgeries by--HEEP. I have, possession, his hand pocket-book, several similar imitations Mr. W.’s signature, defaced fire, legible anyone. I never attested document. And I document itself, possession.”’ Uriah Heep, start, took his pocket bunch keys, opened certain drawer; then, suddenly bethought he about, turned towards us, without looking it. ‘“And I document,”’ Mr. Micawber read again, looking text sermon, ‘“in possession,--that say, I had, early morning, written, since relinquished Mr. Traddles.”’ ‘It quite true,’ assented Traddles. ‘Ury, Ury!’ cried mother, ‘be umble make terms. I know son umble, gentlemen, you will give time think. Mr. Copperfield, I am sure know he always umble, sir!’ It singular see mother still held old trick, son abandoned useless. ‘Mother,’ he said, impatient bite handkerchief his hand wrapped, ‘you better take fire loaded gun me.’ ‘But I love you, Ury,’ cried Mrs. Heep. And I doubt she did; he loved her, however strange may appear; though, sure, congenial couple. ‘And I cannot bear hear provoking gentlemen, endangering more. I told gentleman first, he told upstairs come light, I would answer umble, making amends. Oh, see umble I am, gentlemen, do not mind him!’ ‘Why, there is Copperfield, mother,’ he angrily retorted, pointing his lean finger me, his animosity levelled, prime mover discovery; I undeceive him; ‘there is Copperfield, would given hundred pound say less you have blurted out!’ ‘I cannot help it, Ury,’ cried his mother. ‘I cannot see running danger, carrying head high. Better umble, always was.’ He remained little, biting handkerchief, said scowl: ‘What got bring forward? If anything, go it. What look for?’ Mr. Micawber promptly resumed his letter, glad revert performance he highly satisfied. ‘“Third. And last. I condition show, by--HEEP’S--false books, and--HEEP’S--real memoranda, beginning partially destroyed pocket-book (which I unable comprehend, time accidental discovery Mrs. Micawber, taking possession present abode, locker bin devoted reception ashes calcined domestic hearth), weaknesses, faults, virtues, parental affections, sense honour, unhappy Mr. W. years acted by, warped base purposes of--HEEP.

That meshes; beginning alarming falsified accounts estate Mr. W. receiver, period Mr. W. launched imprudent ill-judged speculations, may money, he morally legally responsible, hand; going pretended borrowings money enormous interest, really coming from--HEEP--and by--HEEP--fraudulently obtained withheld Mr. W. himself, pretence speculations otherwise; perpetuated miscellaneous catalogue unscrupulous chicaneries--gradually thickened, unhappy Mr. W. could see world beyond. Bankrupt, he believed, alike circumstances, hope, honour, his sole reliance upon monster garb man,”’--Mr. Micawber made good deal this, new turn expression,--‘“who, making necessary him, achieved his destruction. All I undertake show. Probably much more!”’ I whispered words Agnes, weeping, half joyfully, half sorrowfully, side; movement among us, Mr. Micawber finished. He said, exceeding gravity, ‘Pardon me,’ proceeded, mixture lowest spirits intense enjoyment, peroration his letter. ‘“I concluded. It merely remains substantiate accusations; then, ill-starred family, disappear landscape appear encumbrance. That soon done. It may reasonably inferred baby first expire inanition, frailest member circle; twins follow next order. So it! For myself, Canterbury Pilgrimage done much; imprisonment civil process, want, soon more. I trust labour hazard investigation--of smallest results slowly pieced together, pressure arduous avocations, grinding penurious apprehensions, rise morn, dewy eve, shadows night, watchful eye one superfluous call Demon--combined struggle parental Poverty turn it, completed, right account, may sprinkling drops sweet water funeral pyre. I ask more. Let be, justice, merely said me, gallant eminent naval Hero, I pretensions cope, I done, I did, despite mercenary selfish objects, For England, home, Beauty. ‘“Remaining always, &c. &c., WILKINS MICAWBER.”’ Much affected, still intensely enjoying himself, Mr. Micawber folded his letter, handed bow aunt, something she might like keep. There was, I noticed first visit long ago, iron safe room. The key it. A hasty suspicion seemed strike Uriah; and, glance Mr. Micawber, he went it, threw doors clanking open. It empty. ‘Where books?’ he cried, frightful face. ‘Some thief stolen books!’ Mr. Micawber tapped ruler. ‘I did, I got key usual--but little earlier--and opened morning.’ ‘Do not uneasy,’ said Traddles. ‘They come possession. I take care them, authority I mentioned.’ ‘You receive stolen goods, you?’ cried Uriah. ‘Under circumstances,’ answered Traddles, ‘yes.’ What astonishment I beheld aunt, profoundly quiet attentive, make dart Uriah Heep, seize collar hands! ‘You know I want?’ said aunt. ‘A strait-waistcoat,’ said he. ‘No. My property!’ returned aunt. ‘Agnes, dear, long I believed really made away father, I would not--and, dear, I did not, even Trot, he knows--breathe syllable placed investment. But, I know fellow’s answerable it, I will it! Trot, come take away him!’ Whether aunt supposed, moment, he kept her property his neck-kerchief, I sure I do not know; she certainly pulled she thought so. I hastened put them, assure her would take care he make utmost restitution everything he wrongly got. This, moments’ reflection, pacified her; she disconcerted she done (though I cannot say much her bonnet) resumed her seat composedly. During last minutes, Mrs. Heep clamouring her son ‘umble’; going her knees us succession, making wildest promises. Her son sat her his chair; and, standing sulkily her, holding her arm his hand, rudely, said me, ferocious look: ‘What want done?’ ‘I tell must done,’ said Traddles. ‘Has Copperfield tongue?’ muttered Uriah, ‘I would good deal could tell me, without lying, somebody cut out.’ ‘My Uriah means umble!’ cried his mother. ‘Do not mind he says, good gentlemen!’ ‘What must done,’ said Traddles, ‘is this. First, deed relinquishment, heard of, must given now--here.’ ‘Suppose I have not got it,’ he interrupted. ‘But have,’ said Traddles; ‘therefore, know, will not suppose so.’ And I cannot help avowing first occasion I really justice clear head, plain, patient, practical good sense, old schoolfellow. ‘Then,’ said Traddles, ‘you must prepare disgorge rapacity become possessed of, make restoration last farthing. All partnership books papers must remain possession; books papers; money accounts securities, kinds. In short, everything here.’ ‘Must it? I do not know that,’ said Uriah. ‘I must time think that.’ ‘Certainly,’ replied Traddles; ‘but, meanwhile, everything done satisfaction, shall maintain possession things; beg you--in short, compel you--to keep room, hold communication anyone.’ ‘I will not it!’ said Uriah, oath. ‘Maidstone jail safer place detention,’ observed Traddles; ‘and though law may longer righting us, may able right us completely can, doubt punishing YOU. Dear me, know quite well I! Copperfield, go round Guildhall, bring couple officers?’ Here, Mrs. Heep broke again, crying her knees Agnes interfere behalf, exclaiming he humble, true, he did not wanted, she would, much purpose; half frantic fears her darling. To inquire he might done, he boldness, would like inquiring mongrel cur might do, spirit tiger. He coward, head foot; showed his dastardly nature his sullenness mortification, much time his mean life. ‘Stop!’ he growled me; wiped his hot face his hand. ‘Mother, hold noise. Well! Let ‘them deed. Go fetch it!’ ‘Do help her, Mr. Dick,’ said Traddles, ‘if please.’ Proud his commission, understanding it, Mr. Dick accompanied her shepherd’s dog might accompany sheep. But, Mrs. Heep gave little trouble; she returned deed, box was, found banker’s book papers afterwards serviceable. ‘Good!’ said Traddles, brought. ‘Now, Mr. Heep, retire think: particularly observing, please, I declare you, part present, one thing done; I explained; must done without delay.’ Uriah, without lifting his eyes ground, shuffled across room his hand his chin, pausing door, said: ‘Copperfield, I always hated you. You have always upstart, you have always me.’ ‘As I think I told before,’ said I, ‘it been, greed cunning, world. It may profitable reflect, future, never greed cunning world yet, much, overreach themselves. It certain death.’ ‘Or certain used teach school (the school I picked much umbleness), nine of the clock eleven, labour curse; eleven of the clock one, blessing cheerfulness, dignity, I do not know all, eh?’ said he sneer. ‘You preach, consistent did. Will not umbleness go down? I should not got round gentleman fellow-partner without it, I think. --Micawber, old bully, I will pay YOU!’ Mr. Micawber, supremely defiant his extended finger, making great deal his chest he slunk door, addressed me, proffered satisfaction ‘witnessing re-establishment mutual confidence Mrs. Micawber’. After which, he invited company generally contemplation affecting spectacle. ‘The veil long interposed Mrs. Micawber myself, withdrawn,’ said Mr. Micawber; ‘and children Author Being come contact equal terms.’ As grateful him, desirous show were, well hurry disorder spirits would permit, I dare say gone, necessary Agnes return her father, yet unable bear dawn hope; someone else hold Uriah safe keeping. So, Traddles remained latter purpose, presently relieved Mr. Dick; Mr. Dick, aunt, I, went home Mr. Micawber. As I parted hurriedly dear girl I owed much, thought she saved, perhaps, morning--her better resolution notwithstanding--I felt devoutly thankful miseries younger days brought knowledge Mr. Micawber. His house far off; street door opened sitting-room, he bolted precipitation quite his own, found bosom family. Mr. Micawber exclaiming, ‘Emma! life!’ rushed Mrs. Micawber’s arms. Mrs. Micawber shrieked, folded Mr. Micawber her embrace. Miss Micawber, nursing unconscious stranger Mrs. Micawber’s last letter me, sensibly affected. The stranger leaped. The twins testified joy several inconvenient innocent demonstrations. Master Micawber, whose disposition appeared soured early disappointment, whose aspect become morose, yielded his better feelings, blubbered. ‘Emma!’ said Mr. Micawber. ‘The cloud past mind. Mutual confidence, long preserved us once, restored, know interruption. Now, welcome poverty!’ cried Mr. Micawber, shedding tears. ‘Welcome misery, welcome houselessness, welcome hunger, rags, tempest, beggary! Mutual confidence sustain us end!’ With expressions, Mr. Micawber placed Mrs. Micawber chair, embraced family round; welcoming variety bleak prospects, appeared, best judgement, anything welcome them; calling upon come Canterbury sing chorus, nothing else left support. But Mrs. Micawber having, strength her emotions, fainted away, first thing done, even chorus could considered complete, recover her. This aunt Mr. Micawber did; aunt introduced, Mrs. Micawber recognized me. ‘Excuse me, dear Mr. Copperfield,’ said poor lady, giving her hand, ‘but I strong; removal late misunderstanding Mr. Micawber first much me.’ ‘Is family, madam?’ said aunt. ‘There present,’ returned Mrs. Micawber. ‘Good gracious, I did not mean that, madam,’ said aunt. ‘I mean, yours?’ ‘Madam,’ replied Mr. Micawber, ‘it true bill.’ ‘And eldest young gentleman, now,’ said aunt, musing, ‘what he brought to?’ ‘It hope I came here,’ said Mr. Micawber, ‘to got Wilkins Church: perhaps I shall express meaning strictly, I say Choir. But vacancy tenor venerable Pile city justly eminent; he has--in short, he contracted habit singing public-houses, rather sacred edifices.’ ‘But he means well,’ said Mrs. Micawber, tenderly. ‘I dare say, love,’ rejoined Mr. Micawber, ‘that he means particularly well; I yet found he carries his meaning, given direction whatsoever.’ Master Micawber’s moroseness aspect returned upon again, he demanded, temper, he do? Whether he born carpenter, coach-painter, he born bird? Whether he could go next street, open chemist’s shop? Whether he could rush next assizes, proclaim lawyer? Whether he could come force opera, succeed violence? Whether he could anything, without brought something? My aunt mused little while, said: ‘Mr. Micawber, I wonder never turned thoughts emigration.’ ‘Madam,’ returned Mr. Micawber, ‘it dream youth, fallacious aspiration riper years.’ I thoroughly persuaded, by, he never thought his life. ‘Aye?’ said aunt, glance me. ‘Why, thing would family, Mr. Mrs. Micawber, emigrate now.’ ‘Capital, madam, capital,’ urged Mr. Micawber, gloomily. ‘That principal, I may say difficulty, dear Mr. Copperfield,’ assented his wife. ‘Capital?’ cried aunt. ‘But us great service--have done us great service, I may say, surely much come fire--and could you, would half good find capital?’ ‘I could receive gift,’ said Mr. Micawber, full fire animation, ‘but sufficient sum could advanced, say five per cent interest, per annum, upon personal liability--say notes hand, twelve, eighteen, twenty-four months, respectively, allow time something turn up--’ ‘Could be? Can shall be, terms,’ returned aunt, ‘if say word. Think now, you. Here people David knows, going Australia shortly. If decide go, should not go ship? You may help other. Think now, Mr. Mrs. Micawber. Take time, weigh well.’ ‘There one question, dear madam, I could wish ask,’ said Mrs. Micawber. ‘The climate, I believe, healthy?’ ‘Finest world!’ said aunt. ‘Just so,’ returned Mrs. Micawber. ‘Then question arises. Now, circumstances country such, man Mr. Micawber’s abilities would fair chance rising social scale? I say, present, might he aspire Governor, anything sort; would reasonable opening his talents develop themselves--that would amply sufficient--and find expansion?’ ‘No better opening anywhere,’ said aunt, ‘for man conducts well, industrious.’ ‘For man conducts well,’ repeated Mrs. Micawber, her clearest business manner, ‘and industrious. Precisely. It evident Australia legitimate sphere action Mr. Micawber!’ ‘I entertain conviction, dear madam,’ said Mr. Micawber, ‘that is, existing circumstances, land, land, family; something extraordinary nature turn shore. It distance--comparatively speaking; though consideration due kindness proposal, I assure mere matter form.’ Shall I ever forget how, moment, he sanguine men, looking fortune; Mrs. Micawber presently discoursed habits kangaroo! Shall I ever recall street Canterbury market-day, without recalling him, he walked back us; expressing, hardy roving manner he assumed, unsettled habits temporary sojourner land; looking bullocks, came by, eye Australian farmer! CHAPTER 53. ANOTHER RETROSPECT I must pause yet again. O, child-wife, figure moving crowd memory, quiet still, saying innocent love childish beauty, Stop think me--turn look upon Little Blossom, flutters ground! I do. All else grows dim, fades away. I Dora, cottage. I know long she ill. I used feeling, I cannot count time. It really long, weeks months; but, usage experience, weary, weary while. They left telling ‘wait days more’. I begun fear, remotely, day may never shine, I shall see child-wife running sunlight her old friend Jip. He is, suddenly, grown old. It may he misses his mistress, something enlivened made younger; he mopes, his sight weak, his limbs feeble, aunt sorry he objects her more, creeps near her he lies Dora’s bed--she sitting bedside--and mildly licks her hand. Dora lies smiling us, beautiful, utters hasty complaining word. She says good her; her dear old careful boy tiring out, she knows; aunt sleep, yet always wakeful, active, kind. Sometimes, little bird-like ladies come see her; talk wedding-day, happy time. What strange rest pause life seems be--and life, within doors without--when I sit quiet, shaded, orderly room, blue eyes child-wife turned towards me, her little fingers twining round hand! Many many hour I sit thus; but, times, three times come freshest mind. It morning; Dora, made trim aunt’s hands, shows her pretty hair curl upon pillow yet, long bright is, she likes loosely gathered net she wears. ‘Not I vain it, now, mocking boy,’ she says, I smile; ‘but used say thought beautiful; because, I first began think you, I used peep glass, wonder whether would like much lock it. Oh foolish fellow were, Doady, I gave one!’ ‘That day painting flowers I given you, Dora, I told much love I was.’ ‘Ah! I did not like tell you,’ says Dora, ‘then, I cried them, I believed really liked me! When I run I used do, Doady, let us go see places silly couple, shall we? And take old walks? And forget poor papa?’ ‘Yes, will, happy days. So must make haste get well, dear.’ ‘Oh, I shall soon that! I much better, do not know!’ It evening; I sit chair, bed, face turned towards me. We silent, smile upon her face. I ceased carry light burden stairs now. She lies day. ‘Doady!’ ‘My dear Dora!’ ‘You will not think I going say, unreasonable, told me, little ago, Mr. Wickfield’s well? I want see Agnes. Very much I want see her.’ ‘I write her, dear.’ ‘Will you?’ ‘Directly.’ ‘What good, kind boy! Doady, take arm. Indeed, dear, it is whim. It is foolish fancy. I want, much indeed, see her!’ ‘I certain it. I tell her so, she sure come.’ ‘You lonely go downstairs, now?’ Dora whispers, her arm neck. ‘How I otherwise, love, I see empty chair?’ ‘My empty chair!’ She clings little while, silence. ‘And really miss me, Doady?’ looking up, brightly smiling. ‘Even poor, giddy, stupid me?’ ‘My heart, upon earth I could miss much?’ ‘Oh, husband! I glad, yet sorry!’ creeping closer me, folding her arms. She laughs sobs, quiet, quite happy. ‘Quite!’ she says. ‘Only give Agnes dear love, tell her I want very, very, much see her; I nothing left wish for.’ ‘Except get well again, Dora.’ ‘Ah, Doady! Sometimes I think--you know I always silly little thing!--that never be!’ ‘Do not say so, Dora! Dearest love, do not think so!’ ‘I will not, I help it, Doady. But I happy; though dear boy lonely himself, his child-wife’s empty chair!’ It night; I her still. Agnes arrived; among us whole day evening. She, aunt, I, sat Dora since morning, together. We talked much, Dora perfectly contented cheerful. We alone. Do I know, now, child-wife soon leave me? They told so; told nothing new thoughts--but I far sure I taken truth heart. I cannot master it. I withdrawn myself, many times today, weep. I remembered Who wept parting living dead. I bethought gracious compassionate history. I tried resign myself, console myself; that, I hope, I may done imperfectly; I cannot firmly settle mind is, end absolutely come. I hold her hand mine, I hold her heart mine, I see her love me, alive strength. I cannot shut pale lingering shadow belief she spared. ‘I going speak you, Doady. I going say something I often thought saying, lately. You will not mind?’ gentle look. ‘Mind, darling?’ ‘Because I do not know think, may thought sometimes. Perhaps often thought same. Doady, dear, I afraid I young.’ I lay face upon pillow her, she looks eyes, speaks softly. Gradually, she goes on, I feel, stricken heart, she speaking herself past. ‘I afraid, dear, I young. I do not mean years only, experience, thoughts, everything. I silly little creature! I afraid would better, loved boy girl, forgotten it. I begun think I fit wife.’ I try stay tears, reply, ‘Oh, Dora, love, fit I husband!’ ‘I do not know,’ old shake her curls. ‘Perhaps! But I fit married I might made so, too. Besides, clever, I never was.’ ‘We happy, sweet Dora.’ ‘I happy, very. But, years went on, dear boy would wearied his child-wife. She would less less companion him. He would sensible wanting his home. She would not improved. It better is.’ ‘Oh, Dora, dearest, dearest, speak so. Every word seems reproach!’ ‘No, syllable!’ she answers, kissing me. ‘Oh, dear, never deserved it, I loved far well say reproachful word you, earnest--it merit I had, except pretty--or thought so. Is lonely, down-stairs, Doady?’ ‘Very! Very!’ ‘Do not cry! Is chair there?’ ‘In old place.’ ‘Oh, poor boy cries! Hush, hush! Now, make one promise. I want speak Agnes. When go downstairs, tell Agnes so, send her me; I speak her, let one come--not even aunt. I want speak Agnes herself. I want speak Agnes, quite alone.’ I promise she shall, immediately; I cannot leave her, grief. ‘I said better is!’ she whispers, she holds her arms. ‘Oh, Doady, years, never could loved child-wife better do; and, years, she would tried disappointed you, might able love her half well! I know I young foolish. It much better is!’ Agnes downstairs, I go parlour; I give her message. She disappears, leaving alone Jip. His Chinese house fire; he lies within it, his bed flannel, querulously trying sleep. The bright moon high clear. As I look night, tears fall fast, undisciplined heart chastened heavily--heavily. I sit fire, thinking blind remorse secret feelings I nourished since marriage. I think every little trifle Dora, feel truth, trifles make sum life. Ever rising sea remembrance, image dear child I knew her first, graced young love, her own, every fascination wherein love rich. Would it, indeed, better loved boy girl, forgotten it? Undisciplined heart, reply! How time wears, I know not; I recalled child-wife’s old companion. More restless he was, he crawls his house, looks me, wanders door, whines go upstairs. ‘Not tonight, Jip! Not tonight!’ He comes slowly back me, licks hand, lifts his dim eyes face. ‘Oh, Jip! It may be, never again!’ He lies feet, stretches sleep, plaintive cry, dead. ‘Oh, Agnes! Look, look, here!’ --That face, full pity, grief, rain tears, awful mute appeal me, solemn hand upraised towards Heaven! ‘Agnes?’ It over. Darkness comes eyes; and, time, things blotted remembrance. CHAPTER 54. Mr. MICAWBER’S TRANSACTIONS This time I enter state mind beneath load sorrow. I came think Future walled me, energy action life end, I never could find refuge grave. I came think so, I say, first shock grief. It slowly grew that. If events I go relate, thickened around me, beginning confuse, end augment, affliction, possible (though I think probable), I might fallen condition. As was, interval occurred I fully knew distress; interval, I even supposed sharpest pangs past; mind could soothe resting innocent beautiful, tender story closed ever. When first proposed I go abroad, came agreed among us I seek restoration peace change travel, I not, even now, distinctly know. The spirit Agnes pervaded thought, said, did, time sorrow, I assume I may refer project her influence. But her influence quiet I know more. And now, indeed, I began think old association her stained-glass window church, prophetic foreshadowing she would me, calamity happen fullness time, found way mind. In sorrow, moment, never forgotten, she stood her upraised hand, she like sacred presence lonely house. When Angel Death alighted there, child-wife fell asleep--they told I could bear hear it--on her bosom, smile. From swoon, I first awoke consciousness her compassionate tears, her words hope peace, her gentle face bending purer region nearer Heaven, undisciplined heart, softening pain. Let go on. I go abroad. That seemed determined among us first. The ground covering could perish departed wife, I waited Mr. Micawber called ‘final pulverization Heep’; departure emigrants. At request Traddles, affectionate devoted friends trouble, returned Canterbury: I mean aunt, Agnes, I. We proceeded appointment straight Mr. Micawber’s house; where, Mr. Wickfield’s, friend labouring ever since explosive meeting. When poor Mrs. Micawber saw come in, black clothes, she sensibly affected. There great deal good Mrs. Micawber’s heart, dunned many years. ‘Well, Mr. Mrs. Micawber,’ aunt’s first salutation seated. ‘Pray, thought emigration proposal mine?’ ‘My dear madam,’ returned Mr. Micawber, ‘perhaps I cannot better express conclusion Mrs. Micawber, humble servant, I may add children, jointly severally arrived, borrowing language illustrious poet, reply Boat shore, Bark sea.’ ‘That is right,’ said aunt. ‘I augur sort good sensible decision.’ ‘Madam, us great deal honour,’ he rejoined. He referred memorandum. ‘With respect pecuniary assistance enabling us launch frail canoe ocean enterprise, I reconsidered important business-point; would beg propose notes hand--drawn, needless stipulate, stamps amounts respectively required various Acts Parliament applying securities--at eighteen, twenty-four, thirty months. The proposition I originally submitted, twelve, eighteen, twenty-four; I apprehensive arrangement might allow sufficient time requisite amount of--Something--to turn up. We might not,’ said Mr. Micawber, looking round room represented several hundred acres highly cultivated land, ‘on first responsibility becoming due, successful harvest, might got harvest in. Labour, I believe, sometimes difficult obtain portion colonial possessions lot combat teeming soil.’ ‘Arrange way please, sir,’ said aunt. ‘Madam,’ he replied, ‘Mrs. Micawber deeply sensible considerate kindness friends patrons. What I wish is, perfectly business-like, perfectly punctual. Turning over, turn over, entirely new leaf; falling back, act falling back, Spring common magnitude; important sense self-respect, besides example son, arrangements concluded man man.’ I do not know Mr. Micawber attached meaning last phrase; I do not know anybody ever does, did; he appeared relish uncommonly, repeated, impressive cough, ‘as man man’. ‘I propose,’ said Mr. Micawber, ‘Bills--a convenience mercantile world, which, I believe, originally indebted Jews, appear devilish deal much ever since--because negotiable. But Bond, description security, would preferred, I happy execute instrument. As man man.’ My aunt observed, case parties willing agree anything, she took granted would difficulty settling point. Mr. Micawber her opinion. ‘In reference domestic preparations, madam,’ said Mr. Micawber, pride, ‘for meeting destiny understood self-devoted, I beg report them. My eldest daughter attends five every morning neighbouring establishment, acquire process--if process may called--of milking cows. My younger children instructed observe, closely circumstances permit, habits pigs poultry maintained poorer parts city: pursuit have, two occasions, brought home, within inch run over. I directed attention, past week, art baking; son Wilkins issued forth walking-stick driven cattle, permitted, rugged hirelings charge, render voluntary service direction--which I regret say, credit nature, often; he generally warned, imprecations, desist.’ ‘All right indeed,’ said aunt, encouragingly. ‘Mrs. Micawber busy, too, I doubt.’ ‘My dear madam,’ returned Mrs. Micawber, her business-like air. ‘I free confess I actively engaged pursuits immediately connected cultivation stock, though well aware claim attention foreign shore. Such opportunities I enabled alienate domestic duties, I devoted corresponding length family. For I seems me, dear Mr. Copperfield,’ said Mrs. Micawber, always fell back me, I suppose old habit, whomsoever else she might address her discourse starting, ‘that time come past buried oblivion; family take Mr. Micawber hand, Mr. Micawber take family hand; lion lie lamb, family terms Mr. Micawber.’ I said I thought too. ‘This, least, light, dear Mr. Copperfield,’ pursued Mrs. Micawber, ‘in I view subject. When I lived home papa mama, papa accustomed ask, point discussion limited circle, “In light Emma view subject?” That papa partial, I know; still, point frigid coldness ever subsisted Mr. Micawber family, I necessarily formed opinion, delusive though may be.’ ‘No doubt. Of course have, madam,’ said aunt. ‘Precisely so,’ assented Mrs. Micawber. ‘Now, I may wrong conclusions; likely I am, individual impression is, gulf family Mr. Micawber may traced apprehension, part family, Mr. Micawber would require pecuniary accommodation. I cannot help thinking,’ said Mrs. Micawber, air deep sagacity, ‘that members family apprehensive Mr. Micawber would solicit names.---I mean conferred Baptism upon children, inscribed Bills Exchange, negotiated Money Market.’ The look penetration Mrs. Micawber announced discovery, one ever thought before, seemed rather astonish aunt; abruptly replied, ‘Well, madam, upon whole, I should not wonder right!’ ‘Mr. Micawber eve casting pecuniary shackles long enthralled him,’ said Mrs. Micawber, ‘and commencing new career country sufficient range his abilities,--which, opinion, exceedingly important; Mr. Micawber’s abilities peculiarly requiring space,--it seems family signalize occasion coming forward. What I could wish see, would meeting Mr. Micawber family festive entertainment, given family’s expense; Mr. Micawber’s health prosperity proposed, leading member family, Mr. Micawber might opportunity developing his views.’ ‘My dear,’ said Mr. Micawber, heat, ‘it may better state distinctly, once, I develop views assembled group, would possibly found offensive nature: impression family are, aggregate, impertinent Snobs; and, detail, unmitigated Ruffians.’ ‘Micawber,’ said Mrs. Micawber, shaking her head, ‘no! You never understood them, never understood you.’ Mr. Micawber coughed. ‘They never understood you, Micawber,’ said his wife. ‘They may incapable it. If so, misfortune. I pity misfortune.’ ‘I extremely sorry, dear Emma,’ said Mr. Micawber, relenting, ‘to betrayed expressions might, even remotely, appearance strong expressions. All I would say is, I go abroad without family coming forward favour me,--in short, parting Shove cold shoulders; that, upon whole, I would rather leave England impetus I possess, derive acceleration quarter. At time, dear, condescend reply communications--which joint experience renders improbable--far barrier wishes.’ The matter thus amicably settled, Mr. Micawber gave Mrs. Micawber his arm, glancing heap books papers lying Traddles table, said would leave us ourselves; ceremoniously did. ‘My dear Copperfield,’ said Traddles, leaning back his chair gone, looking affection made his eyes red, his hair kinds shapes, ‘I do not make excuse troubling business, I know deeply interested it, may divert thoughts. My dear boy, I hope worn out?’ ‘I quite myself,’ said I, pause. ‘We think aunt anyone. You know much she done.’ ‘Surely, surely,’ answered Traddles. ‘Who forget it!’ ‘But even all,’ said I. ‘During last fortnight, new trouble vexed her; she London every day. Several times she gone early, absent evening. Last night, Traddles, journey her, almost midnight she came home. You know her consideration others is. She tell happened distress her.’ My aunt, pale, deep lines her face, sat immovable I finished; stray tears found way her cheeks, she put her hand mine. ‘It is nothing, Trot; it is nothing. There it. You shall know by. Now Agnes, dear, let us attend affairs.’ ‘I must Mr. Micawber justice say,’ Traddles began, ‘that although he would appear worked good account himself, he untiring man he works people. I never saw fellow. If he always goes way, he must be, virtually, two hundred years old, present. The heat he continually putting himself; distracted impetuous manner he diving, day night, among papers books; say nothing immense number letters he written house Mr. Wickfield’s, often across table he sitting opposite, might much easily spoken; quite extraordinary.’ ‘Letters!’ cried aunt. ‘I believe he dreams letters!’ ‘There is Mr. Dick, too,’ said Traddles, ‘has wonders! As soon he released overlooking Uriah Heep, he kept charge I never saw exceeded, he began devote Mr. Wickfield. And really his anxiety use investigations making, his real usefulness extracting, copying, fetching, carrying, quite stimulating us.’ ‘Dick remarkable man,’ exclaimed aunt; ‘and I always said he was. Trot, know it.’ ‘I happy say, Miss Wickfield,’ pursued Traddles, great delicacy great earnestness, ‘that absence Mr. Wickfield considerably improved. Relieved incubus fastened upon long time, dreadful apprehensions he lived, he hardly person. At times, even his impaired power concentrating his memory attention particular points business, recovered much; he able assist us making things clear, found difficult indeed, hopeless, without him. But I come results; short enough; gossip hopeful circumstances I observed, I shall never done.’ His natural manner agreeable simplicity made transparent he said put us good heart, enable Agnes hear her father mentioned greater confidence; less pleasant that. ‘Now, let see,’ said Traddles, looking among papers table. ‘Having counted funds, reduced order great mass unintentional confusion first place, wilful confusion falsification second, take clear Mr. Wickfield might wind his business, his agency-trust, exhibit deficiency defalcation whatever.’ ‘Oh, thank Heaven!’ cried Agnes, fervently. ‘But,’ said Traddles, ‘the surplus would left his means support--and I suppose house sold, even saying this--would small, exceeding probability hundreds pounds, perhaps, Miss Wickfield, would best consider whether he might retain his agency estate he long receiver. His friends might advise him, know; he free. You yourself, Miss Wickfield--Copperfield--I--’ ‘I considered it, Trotwood,’ said Agnes, looking me, ‘and I feel ought be, must be; even recommendation friend I grateful, owe much.’ ‘I say I recommend it,’ observed Traddles. ‘I think right suggest it. No more.’ ‘I happy hear say so,’ answered Agnes, steadily, ‘for gives hope, almost assurance, think alike. Dear Mr. Traddles dear Trotwood, papa free honour, could I wish for! I always aspired, I could released toils he held, render back little portion love care I owe him, devote life him. It been, years, utmost height hopes. To take future myself, next great happiness--the next his release trust responsibility--that I know.’ ‘Have thought how, Agnes?’ ‘Often! I afraid, dear Trotwood. I certain success. So many people know here, think kindly me, I certain. Do not mistrust me. Our wants many. If I rent dear old house, keep school, I shall useful happy.’ The calm fervour her cheerful voice brought back vividly, first dear old house itself, solitary home, heart full speech. Traddles pretended little busily looking among papers. ‘Next, Miss Trotwood,’ said Traddles, ‘that property yours.’ ‘Well, sir,’ sighed aunt. ‘All I got say is, it is gone, I bear it; it is gone, I shall glad get back.’ ‘It originally, I think, eight thousand pounds, Consols?’ said Traddles. ‘Right!’ replied aunt. ‘I cannot account five,’ said Traddles, air perplexity. ‘--thousand, mean?’ inquired aunt, uncommon composure, ‘or pounds?’ ‘Five thousand pounds,’ said Traddles. ‘It was,’ returned aunt. ‘I sold three, myself. One, I paid articles, Trot, dear; two I me. When I lost rest, I thought wise say nothing sum, keep secretly rainy day. I wanted see would come trial, Trot; came nobly--persevering, self-reliant, self-denying! So Dick. Do not speak me, I find nerves little shaken!’ Nobody would thought so, see her sitting upright, her arms folded; she wonderful self-command. ‘Then I delighted say,’ cried Traddles, beaming joy, ‘that recovered whole money!’ ‘Do not congratulate me, anybody!’ exclaimed aunt. ‘How so, sir?’ ‘You believed misappropriated Mr. Wickfield?’ said Traddles. ‘Of course I did,’ said aunt, ‘and therefore easily silenced. Agnes, word!’ ‘And indeed,’ said Traddles, ‘it sold, virtue power management he held you; I need not say sold, whose actual signature. It afterwards pretended Mr. Wickfield, rascal,--and proved, too, figures,--that he possessed money (on general instructions, he said) keep deficiencies difficulties light. Mr. Wickfield, weak helpless his hands pay you, afterwards, several sums interest pretended principal he knew exist, made himself, unhappily, party fraud.’ ‘And last took blame upon himself,’ added aunt; ‘and wrote mad letter, charging robbery, wrong unheard of. Upon I paid visit early one morning, called candle, burnt letter, told he ever could right himself, it; he could not, keep his counsel his daughter’s sake.---If anybody speaks me, I will leave house!’ We remained quiet; Agnes covering her face. ‘Well, dear friend,’ said aunt, pause, ‘and really extorted money back him?’ ‘Why, fact is,’ returned Traddles, ‘Mr. Micawber completely hemmed in, always ready many new points old one failed, he could escape us. A remarkable circumstance is, I really do not think he grasped sum even much gratification his avarice, inordinate, hatred he felt Copperfield. He said me, plainly. He said he would even spent much, baulk injure Copperfield.’ ‘Ha!’ said aunt, knitting her brows thoughtfully, glancing Agnes. ‘And what is become him?’ ‘I do not know. He left here,’ said Traddles, ‘with his mother, clamouring, beseeching, disclosing, whole time. They went away one London night coaches, I know him; except his malevolence parting audacious. He seemed consider hardly less indebted me, Mr. Micawber; I consider (as I told him) quite compliment.’ ‘Do suppose he money, Traddles?’ I asked. ‘Oh dear, yes, I think so,’ he replied, shaking his head, seriously. ‘I say he must pocketed good deal, one way other. But, I think would find, Copperfield, opportunity observing his course, money would never keep man mischief. He incarnate hypocrite, whatever object he pursues, he must pursue crookedly. It is his compensation outward restraints he puts upon himself. Always creeping along ground small end other, he always magnify every object way; consequently hate suspect everybody comes, innocent manner, it. So crooked courses become crookeder, moment, least reason, none. It is necessary consider his history here,’ said Traddles, ‘to know that.’ ‘He is monster meanness!’ said aunt. ‘Really I do not know that,’ observed Traddles thoughtfully. ‘Many people mean, give minds it.’ ‘And now, touching Mr. Micawber,’ said aunt. ‘Well, really,’ said Traddles, cheerfully, ‘I must, more, give Mr. Micawber high praise. But his patient persevering long time, never could hoped anything worth speaking of. And I think ought consider Mr. Micawber right, right’s sake, reflect terms he might made Uriah Heep himself, his silence.’ ‘I think too,’ said I. ‘Now, would give him?’ inquired aunt. ‘Oh! Before come that,’ said Traddles, little disconcerted, ‘I afraid I thought discreet omit (not able carry everything me) two points, making lawless adjustment--for it is perfectly lawless beginning end--of difficult affair. Those I.O.YOU.’s, forth, Mr. Micawber gave advances he had--’ ‘Well! They must paid,’ said aunt. ‘Yes, I do not know may proceeded on, are,’ rejoined Traddles, opening his eyes; ‘and I anticipate, that, time his departure, Mr. Micawber constantly arrested, taken execution.’ ‘Then he must constantly set free again, taken execution,’ said aunt. ‘What is amount altogether?’ ‘Why, Mr. Micawber entered transactions--he calls transactions--with great form, book,’ rejoined Traddles, smiling; ‘and he makes amount hundred three pounds, five.’ ‘Now, shall give him, sum included?’ said aunt. ‘Agnes, dear, I talk division afterwards. What be? Five hundred pounds?’ Upon this, Traddles I struck once. We recommended small sum money, payment, without stipulation Mr. Micawber, Uriah claims came in. We proposed family passage outfit, hundred pounds; Mr. Micawber’s arrangement repayment advances gravely entered into, might wholesome suppose responsibility. To this, I added suggestion, I give explanation his character history Mr. Peggotty, I knew could relied on; Mr. Peggotty quietly entrusted discretion advancing another hundred. I proposed interest Mr. Micawber Mr. Peggotty, confiding much Mr. Peggotty’s story I might feel justified relating, might think expedient; endeavour bring bear upon other, common advantage. We entered warmly views; I may mention once, principals so, shortly afterwards, perfect good harmony. Seeing Traddles glanced anxiously aunt again, I reminded second last point he adverted. ‘You aunt excuse me, Copperfield, I touch upon painful theme, I greatly fear I shall,’ said Traddles, hesitating; ‘but I think necessary bring recollection. On day Mr. Micawber’s memorable denunciation threatening allusion made Uriah Heep aunt’s--husband.’ My aunt, retaining her stiff position, apparent composure, assented nod. ‘Perhaps,’ observed Traddles, ‘it mere purposeless impertinence?’ ‘No,’ returned aunt. ‘There was--pardon me--really person, his power?’ hinted Traddles. ‘Yes, good friend,’ said aunt. Traddles, perceptible lengthening his face, explained he able approach subject; shared fate Mr. Micawber’s liabilities, comprehended terms he made; longer authority Uriah Heep; he could us, us, injury annoyance, doubt he would. My aunt remained quiet; stray tears found way her cheeks. ‘You quite right,’ she said. ‘It thoughtful mention it.’ ‘Can I--or Copperfield--do anything?’ asked Traddles, gently. ‘Nothing,’ said aunt. ‘I thank many times. Trot, dear, vain threat! Let us Mr. Mrs. Micawber back. And do not speak me!’ With she smoothed her dress, sat, her upright carriage, looking door. ‘Well, Mr. Mrs. Micawber!’ said aunt, entered. ‘We discussing emigration, many apologies keeping room long; I will tell arrangements propose.’ These she explained unbounded satisfaction family,--children present,--and much awakening Mr. Micawber’s punctual habits opening stage bill transactions, he could dissuaded immediately rushing out, highest spirits, buy stamps his notes hand. But, his joy received sudden check; within five minutes, he returned custody sheriff ‘s officer, informing us, flood tears, lost. We, quite prepared event, course proceeding Uriah Heep’s, soon paid money; five minutes Mr. Micawber seated table, filling stamps expression perfect joy, congenial employment, making punch, could impart full completeness his shining face. To see work stamps, relish artist, touching like pictures, looking sideways, taking weighty notes dates amounts his pocket-book, contemplating finished, high sense precious value, sight indeed. ‘Now, best thing do, sir, you will allow advise you,’ said aunt, silently observing him, ‘is abjure occupation evermore.’ ‘Madam,’ replied Mr. Micawber, ‘it intention register vow virgin page future. Mrs. Micawber attest it. I trust,’ said Mr. Micawber, solemnly, ‘that son Wilkins ever bear mind, he infinitely better put his fist fire, use handle serpents poisoned life-blood his unhappy parent!’ Deeply affected, changed moment image despair, Mr. Micawber regarded serpents look gloomy abhorrence (in his late admiration quite subdued), folded put his pocket. This closed proceedings evening. We weary sorrow fatigue, aunt I return London morrow. It arranged Micawbers follow us, effecting sale goods broker; Mr. Wickfield’s affairs brought settlement, convenient speed, direction Traddles; Agnes also come London, pending arrangements. We passed night old house, which, freed presence Heeps, seemed purged disease; I lay old room, like shipwrecked wanderer come home. We went back next day aunt’s house--not mine--and she I sat alone, old, going bed, she said: ‘Trot, really wish know I upon mind lately?’ ‘Indeed I do, aunt. If ever time I felt unwilling sorrow anxiety I could share, now.’ ‘You sorrow enough, child,’ said aunt, affectionately, ‘without addition little miseries. I could motive, Trot, keeping anything you.’ ‘I know well,’ said I. ‘But tell now.’ ‘Would ride little way tomorrow morning?’ asked aunt. ‘Of course.’ ‘At nine,’ said she. ‘I will tell then, dear.’ At nine, accordingly, went little chariot, drove London. We drove long way streets, came one large hospitals. Standing hard building plain hearse. The driver recognized aunt, and, obedience motion her hand window, drove slowly off; following. ‘You understand now, Trot,’ said aunt. ‘He gone!’ ‘Did he die hospital?’ ‘Yes.’ She sat immovable beside me; but, I saw stray tears her face. ‘He before,’ said aunt presently. ‘He ailing long time--a shattered, broken man, many years. When he knew his state last illness, he asked send me. He sorry then. Very sorry.’ ‘You went, I know, aunt.’ ‘I went. I good deal afterwards.’ ‘He died night went Canterbury?’ said I. My aunt nodded. ‘No one harm now,’ she said. ‘It vain threat.’ We drove away, town, churchyard Hornsey. ‘Better streets,’ said aunt. ‘He born here.’ We alighted; followed plain coffin corner I remember well, service read consigning dust. ‘Six-and-thirty years ago, day, dear,’ said aunt, walked back chariot, ‘I married. God forgive us all!’ We took seats silence; she sat beside long time, holding hand. At length she suddenly burst tears, said: ‘He fine-looking man I married him, Trot--and he sadly changed!’ It last long. After relief tears, she soon became composed, even cheerful. Her nerves little shaken, she said, she would given way it. God forgive us all! So rode back her little cottage Highgate, found following short note, arrived morning’s post Mr. Micawber: ‘Canterbury, ‘Friday. ‘My dear Madam, Copperfield, ‘The fair land promise lately looming horizon enveloped impenetrable mists, ever withdrawn eyes drifting wretch whose Doom sealed! ‘Another writ issued (in His Majesty’s High Court King’s Bench Westminster), another HEEP V.

TEMPEST I approach event life, indelible, awful, bound infinite variety ties preceded it, pages, that, beginning narrative, I seen growing larger larger I advanced, like great tower plain, throwing fore-cast shadow even incidents childish days. For years occurred, I dreamed often. I started vividly impressed it, fury yet seemed raging quiet room, still night. I dream sometimes, though lengthened uncertain intervals, hour. I association stormy wind, lightest mention sea-shore, strong mind conscious. As plainly I behold happened, I try write down. I recall it, see done; happens me. The time drawing rapidly sailing emigrant-ship, good old nurse (almost broken-hearted me, first met) came London. I constantly her, her brother, Micawbers (they much together); Emily I never saw. One evening time close hand, I alone Peggotty her brother. Our conversation turned Ham. She described us tenderly he taken leave her, manfully quietly he borne himself. Most all, late, she believed he tried. It subject affectionate creature never tired; interest hearing many examples she, much him, relate, equal relating them. My aunt I time vacating two cottages Highgate; I intending go abroad, she return her house Dover. We temporary lodging Covent Garden. As I walked home it, evening’s conversation, reflecting passed Ham I last Yarmouth, I wavered original purpose I formed, leaving letter Emily I take leave her uncle board ship, thought would better write her now. She might desire, I thought, receiving communication, send parting word her unhappy lover. I ought give her opportunity. I therefore sat room, going bed, wrote her. I told her I seen him, he requested tell her I already written place sheets. I faithfully repeated it. I need enlarge upon it, I right. Its deep fidelity goodness adorned man. I left out, sent round morning; line Mr. Peggotty, requesting give her; went bed daybreak. I weaker I knew then; and, falling asleep sun up, lay late, unrefreshed, next day. I roused silent presence aunt bedside. I felt sleep, I suppose feel things. ‘Trot, dear,’ she said, I opened eyes, ‘I could not make mind disturb you. Mr. Peggotty here; shall he come up?’ I replied yes, he soon appeared. ‘Mas’r Davy,’ he said, shaken hands, ‘I giv Them’ly letter, sir, she writ heer; begged fur ask read it, see hurt in’t, kind take charge on’t.’ ‘Have read it?’ said I. He nodded sorrowfully. I opened it, read follows: ‘I got message. Oh, I write, thank good blessed kindness me! ‘I put words close heart. I shall keep till I die. They sharp thorns, comfort. I prayed them, oh, I prayed much. When I find are, uncle is, I think God must be, cry him. ‘Good-bye ever. Now, dear, friend, good-bye ever world. In another world, I forgiven, I may wake child come you. All thanks blessings. Farewell, evermore.’ This, blotted tears, letter. ‘May I tell her doen’t see hurt in’t, you will kind take charge on’t, Mas’r Davy?’ said Mr. Peggotty, I read it. ‘Unquestionably,’ said I--‘but I thinking--’ ‘Yes, Mas’r Davy?’ ‘I thinking,’ said I, ‘that I will go Yarmouth. There is time, spare, go come back ship sails. My mind constantly running him, his solitude; put letter her writing his hand time, enable tell her, moment parting, he got it, kindness them. I solemnly accepted his commission, dear good fellow, cannot discharge completely. The journey nothing me. I restless, shall better motion. I will go tonight.’ Though he anxiously endeavoured dissuade me, I saw he mind; this, I required confirmed intention, would effect. He went round coach office, request, took box-seat mail. In evening I started, conveyance, road I traversed many vicissitudes. ‘Do not think that,’ I asked coachman, first stage London, ‘a remarkable sky? I do not remember seen one like it.’ ‘Nor I--not equal it,’ he replied. ‘That is wind, sir. There will mischief done sea, I expect, long.’ It murky confusion--here blotted colour like colour smoke damp fuel--of flying clouds, tossed remarkable heaps, suggesting greater heights clouds depths bottom deepest hollows earth, wild moon seemed plunge headlong, if, dread disturbance laws nature, she lost her way frightened. There wind day; rising then, extraordinary great sound. In another hour much increased, sky overcast, blew hard. But, night advanced, clouds closing densely over-spreading whole sky, dark, came blow, harder harder. It still increased, horses could scarcely face wind. Many times, dark part night (it late September, nights short), leaders turned about, came dead stop; often serious apprehension coach would blown over. Sweeping gusts rain came storm, like showers steel; and, times, shelter trees lee walls got, fain stop, sheer impossibility continuing struggle. When day broke, blew harder harder. I Yarmouth seamen said blew great guns, I never known like this, anything approaching it. We came Ipswich--very late, fight every inch ground since ten miles London; found cluster people market-place, risen beds night, fearful falling chimneys. Some these, congregating inn-yard changed horses, told us great sheets lead ripped high church-tower, flung by-street, blocked up. Others tell country people, coming neighbouring villages, seen great trees lying torn earth, whole ricks scattered roads fields. Still, abatement storm, blew harder. As struggled on, nearer nearer sea, mighty wind blowing dead shore, force became terrific. Long saw sea, spray lips, showered salt rain upon us. The water out, miles miles flat country adjacent Yarmouth; every sheet puddle lashed banks, stress little breakers setting heavily towards us. When came within sight sea, waves horizon, caught intervals rolling abyss, like glimpses another shore towers buildings. When last got town, people came doors, aslant, streaming hair, making wonder mail come night. I put old inn, went look sea; staggering along street, strewn sand seaweed, flying blotches sea-foam; afraid falling slates tiles; holding people I met, angry corners. Coming near beach, I saw, boatmen, half people town, lurking behind buildings; some, braving fury storm look away sea, blown sheer course trying get zigzag back. Joining groups, I found bewailing women whose husbands away herring oyster boats, much reason think might foundered could run anywhere safety. Grizzled old sailors among people, shaking heads, looked water sky, muttering one another; ship-owners, excited uneasy; children, huddling together, peering older faces; even stout mariners, disturbed anxious, levelling glasses sea behind places shelter, surveying enemy. The tremendous sea itself, I could find sufficient pause look it, agitation blinding wind, flying stones sand, awful noise, confounded me. As high watery walls came rolling in, and, highest, tumbled surf, looked least would engulf town. As receding wave swept back hoarse roar, seemed scoop deep caves beach, purpose undermine earth. When white-headed billows thundered on, dashed pieces reached land, every fragment late whole seemed possessed full might wrath, rushing gathered composition another monster. Undulating hills changed valleys, undulating valleys (with solitary storm-bird sometimes skimming them) lifted hills; masses water shivered shook beach booming sound; every shape tumultuously rolled on, soon made, change shape place, beat another shape place away; ideal shore horizon, towers buildings, rose fell; clouds fell fast thick; I seemed see rending upheaving nature. Not finding Ham among people memorable wind--for still remembered there, greatest ever known blow upon coast--had brought together, I made way his house. It shut; one answered knocking, I went, back ways by-lanes, yard he worked. I learned, there, he gone Lowestoft, meet sudden exigency ship-repairing his skill required; he would back tomorrow morning, good time. I went back inn; I washed dressed, tried sleep, vain, five of the clock afternoon. I sat five minutes coffee-room fire, waiter, coming stir it, excuse talking, told two colliers gone down, hands, miles away; ships seen labouring hard Roads, trying, great distress, keep shore. Mercy them, poor sailors, said he, another night like last! I much depressed spirits; solitary; felt uneasiness Ham’s there, disproportionate occasion. I seriously affected, without knowing much, late events; long exposure fierce wind confused me. There jumble thoughts recollections, I lost clear arrangement time distance. Thus, I gone town, I surprised, I think, encounter someone I knew must London. So speak, respects curious inattention mind. Yet busy, too, remembrances place naturally awakened; particularly distinct vivid. In state, waiter’s dismal intelligence ships immediately connected itself, without effort volition, uneasiness Ham. I persuaded I apprehension his returning Lowestoft sea, lost. This grew strong me, I resolved go back yard I took dinner, ask boat-builder he thought his attempting return sea likely? If he gave least reason think so, I would go Lowestoft prevent bringing me. I hastily ordered dinner, went back yard. I none soon; boat-builder, lantern his hand, locking yard-gate. He quite laughed I asked question, said fear; man his senses, them, would put gale wind, least Ham Peggotty, born seafaring. So sensible this, beforehand, I really felt ashamed I nevertheless impelled do, I went back inn. If wind could rise, I think rising. The howl roar, rattling doors windows, rumbling chimneys, apparent rocking house sheltered me, prodigious tumult sea, fearful morning. But great darkness besides; invested storm new terrors, real fanciful. I could eat, I could sit still, I could continue steadfast anything. Something within me, faintly answering storm without, tossed depths memory made tumult them. Yet, hurry thoughts, wild running thundering sea,--the storm, uneasiness regarding Ham always fore-ground. My dinner went away almost untasted, I tried refresh glass two wine. In vain. I fell dull slumber fire, without losing consciousness, either uproar doors, place I was. Both became overshadowed new indefinable horror; I awoke--or rather I shook lethargy bound chair--my whole frame thrilled objectless unintelligible fear. I walked fro, tried read old gazetteer, listened awful noises: looked faces, scenes, figures fire. At length, steady ticking undisturbed clock wall tormented degree I resolved go bed. It reassuring, night, told inn-servants agreed together sit morning. I went bed, exceedingly weary heavy; but, lying down, sensations vanished, magic, I broad awake, every sense refined. For hours I lay there, listening wind water; imagining, now, I heard shrieks sea; now, I distinctly heard firing signal guns; now, fall houses town. I got up, several times, looked out; could see nothing, except reflection window-panes faint candle I left burning, haggard face looking black void. At length, restlessness attained pitch, I hurried clothes, went downstairs. In large kitchen, I dimly saw bacon ropes onions hanging beams, watchers clustered together, various attitudes, table, purposely moved away great chimney, brought near door. A pretty girl, her ears stopped her apron, her eyes upon door, screamed I appeared, supposing spirit; others presence mind, glad addition company. One man, referring topic discussing, asked whether I thought souls collier-crews gone down, storm? I remained there, I dare say, two hours. Once, I opened yard-gate, looked empty street. The sand, sea-weed, flakes foam, driving by; I obliged call assistance I could shut gate again, make fast wind. There dark gloom solitary chamber, I length returned it; I tired now, and, getting bed again, fell--off tower precipice--into depths sleep. I impression long time, though I dreamed elsewhere variety scenes, always blowing dream. At length, I lost feeble hold upon reality, engaged two dear friends, I do not know, siege town roar cannonading. The thunder cannon loud incessant, I could hear something I much desired hear, I made great exertion awoke. It broad day--eight nine of the clock; storm raging, lieu batteries; someone knocking calling door. ‘What matter?’ I cried. ‘A wreck! Close by!’ I sprung bed, asked, wreck? ‘A schooner, Spain Portugal, laden fruit wine. Make haste, sir, want see her! It is thought, beach, she will go pieces every moment.’ The excited voice went clamouring along staircase; I wrapped clothes quickly I could, ran street. Numbers people me, running one direction, beach. I ran way, outstripping good many, soon came facing wild sea. The wind might time lulled little, though sensibly cannonading I dreamed of, diminished silencing half-a-dozen guns hundreds. But sea, upon additional agitation whole night, infinitely terrific I seen last. Every appearance presented, bore expression swelled; height breakers rose, and, looking one another, bore one another down, rolled in, interminable hosts, appalling. In difficulty hearing anything wind waves, crowd, unspeakable confusion, first breathless efforts stand weather, I confused I looked sea wreck, saw nothing foaming heads great waves. A half-dressed boatman, standing next me, pointed his bare arm (a tattoo’d arrow it, pointing direction) left. Then, O great Heaven, I saw it, close upon us! One mast broken short off, six eight feet deck, lay side, entangled maze sail rigging; ruin, ship rolled beat--which she without moment’s pause, violence quite inconceivable--beat side would stave in. Some efforts even made, cut portion wreck away; for, ship, broadside on, turned towards us her rolling, I plainly descried her people work axes, especially one active figure long curling hair, conspicuous among rest. But great cry, audible even wind water, rose shore moment; sea, sweeping rolling wreck, made clean breach, carried men, spars, casks, planks, bulwarks, heaps toys, boiling surge. The second mast yet standing, rags rent sail, wild confusion broken cordage flapping fro. The ship struck once, boatman hoarsely said ear, lifted struck again. I understood add she parting amidships, I could readily suppose so, rolling beating tremendous human work suffer long. As he spoke, another great cry pity beach; four men arose wreck deep, clinging rigging remaining mast; uppermost, active figure curling hair. There bell board; ship rolled dashed, like desperate creature driven mad, showing us whole sweep her deck, she turned her beam-ends towards shore, nothing her keel, she sprung wildly turned towards sea, bell rang; sound, knell unhappy men, borne towards us wind. Again lost her, she rose. Two men gone. The agony shore increased. Men groaned, clasped hands; women shrieked, turned away faces. Some ran wildly along beach, crying help help could be. I found one these, frantically imploring knot sailors I knew, let two lost creatures perish eyes. They making me, agitated way--I do not know how, little I could hear I scarcely composed enough understand--that lifeboat bravely manned hour ago, could nothing; man would desperate attempt wade rope, establish communication shore, nothing left try; I noticed new sensation moved people beach, saw part, Ham come breaking front. I ran him--as well I know, repeat appeal help. But, distracted though I was, sight new terrible, determination his face, his look sea--exactly look I remembered connexion morning Emily’s flight--awoke knowledge his danger. I held back arms; implored men I speaking, listen him, murder, let stir sand! Another cry arose shore; looking wreck, saw cruel sail, blow blow, beat lower two men, fly triumph round active figure left alone upon mast. Against sight, determination calmly desperate man already accustomed lead half people present, I might hopefully entreated wind. ‘Mas’r Davy,’ he said, cheerily grasping hands, ‘if time come, ‘it is come. If ‘tan’t, I will bide it. Lord bless you, bless all! Mates, make ready! I am a-going off!’ I swept away, unkindly, distance, people around made stay; urging, I confusedly perceived, he bent going, help without, I endanger precautions his safety troubling rested. I do not know I answered, rejoined; I saw hurry beach, men running ropes capstan there, penetrating circle figures hid me. Then, I saw standing alone, seaman’s frock trousers: rope his hand, slung his wrist: another round his body: several best men holding, little distance, latter, he laid himself, slack upon shore, his feet. The wreck, even unpractised eye, breaking up. I saw she parting middle, life solitary man upon mast hung thread. Still, he clung it. He singular red cap on,--not like sailor’s cap, finer colour; yielding planks destruction rolled bulged, his anticipative death-knell rung, he seen us wave it. I saw now, thought I going distracted, his action brought old remembrance mind dear friend. Ham watched sea, standing alone, silence suspended breath behind him, storm before, great retiring wave, when, backward glance held rope made fast round his body, he dashed it, moment buffeting water; rising hills, falling valleys, lost beneath foam; drawn land. They hauled hastily. He hurt. I saw blood his face, I stood; he took thought that. He seemed hurriedly give directions leaving free--or I judged motion his arm--and gone before. And he made wreck, rising hills, falling valleys, lost beneath rugged foam, borne towards shore, borne towards ship, striving hard valiantly. The distance nothing, power sea wind made strife deadly. At length he neared wreck. He near, one his vigorous strokes he would clinging it,--when high, green, vast hill-side water, moving shoreward, beyond ship, he seemed leap mighty bound, ship gone! Some eddying fragments I saw sea, mere cask broken, running spot hauling in. Consternation every face. They drew feet--insensible--dead. He carried nearest house; and, one preventing now, I remained near him, busy, every means restoration tried; he beaten death great wave, his generous heart stilled ever. As I sat beside bed, hope abandoned done, fisherman, known Emily I children, ever since, whispered name door. ‘Sir,’ said he, tears starting his weather-beaten face, which, his trembling lips, ashy pale, ‘will come yonder?’ The old remembrance recalled me, his look. I asked him, terror-stricken, leaning arm he held support me: ‘Has body come ashore?’ He said, ‘Yes.’ ‘Do I know it?’ I asked then. He answered nothing. But he led shore. And part she I looked shells, two children--on part lighter fragments old boat, blown last night, scattered wind--among ruins home he wronged--I saw lying his head upon his arm, I often seen lie school. CHAPTER 56. THE NEW WOUND, AND THE OLD No need, O Steerforth, said, last spoke together, hour I little deemed parting-hour--no need said, ‘Think best!’ I done ever; could I change now, looking sight! They brought hand-bier, laid it, covered flag, took bore towards houses. All men carried known him, gone sailing him, seen merry bold. They carried wild roar, hush midst tumult; took cottage Death already. But set bier threshold, looked one another, me, whispered. I knew why. They felt right lay quiet room. We went town, took burden inn. So soon I could collect thoughts, I sent Joram, begged provide conveyance could got London night. I knew care it, hard duty preparing his mother receive it, could rest me; I anxious discharge duty faithfully I could. I chose night journey, might less curiosity I left town. But, although nearly midnight I came yard chaise, followed I charge, many people waiting. At intervals, along town, even little way upon road, I saw more: length bleak night open country around me, ashes youthful friendship. Upon mellow autumn day, noon, ground perfumed fallen leaves, many more, beautiful tints yellow, red, brown, yet hung upon trees, sun shining, I arrived Highgate. I walked last mile, thinking I went along I do; left carriage followed night, awaiting orders advance. The house, I came it, looked same. Not blind raised; sign life dull paved court, covered way leading disused door. The wind quite gone down, nothing moved. I not, first, courage ring gate; I ring, errand seemed expressed sound bell. The little parlour-maid came out, key her hand; looking earnestly she unlocked gate, said: ‘I beg pardon, sir. Are ill?’ ‘I much agitated, fatigued.’ ‘Is anything matter, sir?---Mr. James?--’ ‘Hush!’ said I. ‘Yes, something happened, I break Mrs. Steerforth. She home?’ The girl anxiously replied her mistress seldom now, even carriage; she kept her room; she saw company, would see me. Her mistress up, she said, Miss Dartle her. What message she take upstairs? Giving her strict charge careful her manner, carry card say I waited, I sat drawing-room (which reached) she come back. Its former pleasant air occupation gone, shutters half closed. The harp used many many day. His picture, boy, there. The cabinet his mother kept his letters there. I wondered she ever read now; she would ever read more! The house still I heard girl’s light step upstairs. On her return, she brought message, effect Mrs. Steerforth invalid could come down; I would excuse her her chamber, she would glad see me. In moments I stood her. She his room; her own. I felt, course, she taken occupy it, remembrance him; many tokens his old sports accomplishments, she surrounded, remained there, he left them, reason. She murmured, however, even her reception me, she her chamber aspect unsuited her infirmity; her stately look repelled least suspicion truth. At her chair, usual, Rosa Dartle. From first moment her dark eyes resting me, I saw she knew I bearer evil tidings. The scar sprung view instant. She withdrew herself step behind chair, keep her face Mrs. Steerforth’s observation; scrutinized piercing gaze never faltered, never shrunk. ‘I sorry observe mourning, sir,’ said Mrs. Steerforth. ‘I unhappily widower,’ said I. ‘You young know great loss,’ she returned. ‘I grieved hear it. I grieved hear it. I hope Time good you.’ ‘I hope Time,’ said I, looking her, ‘will good us. Dear Mrs. Steerforth, must trust that, heaviest misfortunes.’ The earnestness manner, tears eyes, alarmed her. The whole course her thoughts appeared stop, change. I tried command voice gently saying his name, trembled. She repeated herself, two three times, low tone. Then, addressing me, she said, enforced calmness: ‘My son ill.’ ‘Very ill.’ ‘You seen him?’ ‘I have.’ ‘Are reconciled?’ I could say Yes, I could say No. She slightly turned her head towards spot Rosa Dartle standing her elbow, moment I said, motion lips, Rosa, ‘Dead!’ That Mrs. Steerforth might induced look behind her, read, plainly written, she yet prepared know, I met her look quickly; I seen Rosa Dartle throw her hands air vehemence despair horror, clasp her face. The handsome lady--so like, oh like!--regarded fixed look, put her hand her forehead. I besought her calm, prepare herself bear I tell; I rather entreated her weep, she sat like stone figure. ‘When I last here,’ I faltered, ‘Miss Dartle told he sailing there. The night last dreadful one sea. If he sea night, near dangerous coast, said he was; vessel seen really ship which--’ ‘Rosa!’ said Mrs. Steerforth, ‘come me!’ She came, sympathy gentleness. Her eyes gleamed like fire she confronted his mother, broke frightful laugh. ‘Now,’ she said, ‘is pride appeased, madwoman? Now he made atonement you--with his life! Do hear?---His life!’ Mrs. Steerforth, fallen back stiffly her chair, making sound moan, cast her eyes upon her wide stare. ‘Aye!’ cried Rosa, smiting herself passionately breast, ‘look me! Moan, groan, look me! Look here!’ striking scar, ‘at dead child’s handiwork!’ The moan mother uttered, time time, went My heart. Always same. Always inarticulate stifled. Always accompanied incapable motion head, change face. Always proceeding rigid mouth closed teeth, jaw locked face frozen pain. ‘Do remember he this?’ she proceeded. ‘Do remember when, his inheritance nature, pampering his pride passion, he this, disfigured life? Look me, marked I die his high displeasure; moan groan made him!’ ‘Miss Dartle,’ I entreated her. ‘For Heaven’s sake--’ ‘I WILL speak!’ she said, turning her lightning eyes. ‘Be silent, you! Look me, I say, proud mother proud, false son! Moan nurture him, moan corruption him, moan loss him, moan mine!’ She clenched her hand, trembled her spare, worn figure, her passion killing her inches. ‘You, resent his self-will!’ she exclaimed. ‘You, injured his haughty temper! You, opposed both, hair grey, qualities made gave birth! YOU, his cradle reared he was, stunted he been! Are rewarded, now, years trouble?’ ‘Oh, Miss Dartle, shame! Oh cruel!’ ‘I tell you,’ she returned, ‘I WILL speak her. No power earth stop me, I standing here! Have I silent years, shall I speak now? I loved better ever loved him!’ turning her fiercely. ‘I could loved him, asked return. If I his wife, I could slave his caprices word love year. I been. Who knows better I? You exacting, proud, punctilious, selfish. My love would devoted--would trod paltry whimpering foot!’ With flashing eyes, she stamped upon ground she actually it. ‘Look here!’ she said, striking scar again, relentless hand. ‘When he grew better understanding he done, he saw it, repented it! I could sing him, talk him, show ardour I felt he did, attain labour knowledge interested him; I attracted him. When he freshest truest, he loved me. Yes, he did! Many time, put slight word, he taken Me his heart!’ She said taunting pride midst her frenzy--for little less--yet eager remembrance it, smouldering embers gentler feeling kindled moment. ‘I descended--as I might known I should, he fascinated his boyish courtship--into doll, trifle occupation idle hour, dropped, taken up, trifled with, inconstant humour took him. When he grew weary, I grew weary. As his fancy died out, I would tried strengthen power I had, I would married his forced take his wife. We fell away one another without word. Perhaps saw it, sorry. Since then, I mere disfigured piece furniture both; eyes, ears, feelings, remembrances. Moan? Moan made him; love. I tell time was, I loved better ever did!’ She stood her bright angry eyes confronting wide stare, set face; softened more, moaning repeated, face picture. ‘Miss Dartle,’ said I, ‘if obdurate feel afflicted mother--’ ‘Who feels me?’ she sharply retorted. ‘She sown this. Let her moan harvest she reaps today!’ ‘And his faults--’ I began. ‘Faults!’ she cried, bursting passionate tears. ‘Who dares malign him? He soul worth millions friends he stooped!’ ‘No one loved better, one hold dearer remembrance I,’ I replied. ‘I meant say, compassion his mother; his faults--you bitter them--’ ‘It is false,’ she cried, tearing her black hair; ‘I loved him!’ ‘--if his faults cannot,’ I went on, ‘be banished remembrance, hour; look figure, even one never seen before, render help!’ All time, figure unchanged, looked unchangeable. Motionless, rigid, staring; moaning dumb way time time, helpless motion head; giving sign life. Miss Dartle suddenly kneeled it, began loosen dress. ‘A curse upon you!’ she said, looking round me, mingled expression rage grief. ‘It evil hour ever came here! A curse upon you! Go!’ After passing room, I hurried back ring bell, sooner alarm servants. She taken impassive figure her arms, and, still upon her knees, weeping it, kissing it, calling it, rocking fro upon her bosom like child, trying every tender means rouse dormant senses. No longer afraid leaving her, I noiselessly turned back again; alarmed house I went out. Later day, I returned, laid his mother’s room. She same, told me; Miss Dartle never left her; doctors attendance, many things tried; she lay like statue, except low sound then. I went dreary house, darkened windows. The windows chamber he lay, I darkened last. I lifted leaden hand, held heart; world seemed death silence, broken his mother’s moaning. CHAPTER 57. THE EMIGRANTS One thing more, I do, yielding shock emotions. It was, conceal occurred, going away; dismiss voyage happy ignorance. In this, time lost. I took Mr. Micawber aside night, confided task standing Mr. Peggotty intelligence late catastrophe. He zealously undertook so, intercept newspaper might, without precautions, reach him. ‘If penetrates him, sir,’ said Mr. Micawber, striking breast, ‘it shall first pass body!’ Mr. Micawber, I must observe, his adaptation new state society, acquired bold buccaneering air, absolutely lawless, defensive prompt. One might supposed child wilderness, long accustomed live confines civilization, return his native wilds. He provided himself, among things, complete suit oilskin, straw hat low crown, pitched caulked outside. In rough clothing, common mariner’s telescope his arm, shrewd trick casting his eye sky looking dirty weather, he far nautical, his manner, Mr. Peggotty. His whole family, I may express it, cleared action. I found Mrs. Micawber closest uncompromising bonnets, made fast chin; shawl tied her (as I tied up, aunt first received me) like bundle, secured behind waist, strong knot. Miss Micawber I found made snug stormy weather, manner; nothing superfluous her. Master Micawber hardly visible Guernsey shirt, shaggiest suit slops I ever saw; children done up, like preserved meats, impervious cases. Both Mr. Micawber his eldest son wore sleeves loosely turned back wrists, ready lend hand direction, ‘tumble up’, sing out, ‘Yeo--Heave--Yeo!’ shortest notice. Thus Traddles I found nightfall, assembled wooden steps, time known Hungerford Stairs, watching departure boat property board. I told Traddles terrible event, greatly shocked him; could doubt kindness keeping secret, he come help last service. It I took Mr. Micawber aside, received his promise. The Micawber family lodged little, dirty, tumble-down public-house, days close stairs, whose protruding wooden rooms overhung river. The family, emigrants, objects interest Hungerford, attracted many beholders, glad take refuge room. It one wooden chambers upstairs, tide flowing underneath. My aunt Agnes there, busily making little extra comforts, way dress, children. Peggotty quietly assisting, old insensible work-box, yard-measure, bit wax-candle her, outlived much. It easy answer her inquiries; still less whisper Mr. Peggotty, Mr. Micawber brought in, I given letter, well. But I both, made happy. If I showed trace I felt, sorrows sufficient account it. ‘And ship sail, Mr. Micawber?’ asked aunt. Mr. Micawber considered necessary prepare either aunt his wife, degrees, said, sooner he expected yesterday. ‘The boat brought word, I suppose?’ said aunt. ‘It did, madam,’ he returned. ‘Well?’ said aunt. ‘And she sails--’ ‘Madam,’ he replied, ‘I informed must positively board seven tomorrow morning.’ ‘Heyday!’ said aunt, ‘that is soon. Is sea-going fact, Mr. Peggotty?’ ‘It Is so, madam. She will drop river theer tide. If Mas’r Davy sister comes aboard Gravesen’, arternoon next day, they will see last us.’ ‘And shall do,’ said I, ‘be sure!’ ‘Until then, sea,’ observed Mr. Micawber, glance intelligence me, ‘Mr. Peggotty constantly keep double look-out together, goods chattels. Emma, love,’ said Mr. Micawber, clearing his throat his magnificent way, ‘my friend Mr. Thomas Traddles obliging solicit, ear, he privilege ordering ingredients necessary composition moderate portion Beverage peculiarly associated, minds, Roast Beef Old England. I allude to--in short, Punch. Under ordinary circumstances, I scruple entreat indulgence Miss Trotwood Miss Wickfield, but-’ ‘I say myself,’ said aunt, ‘that I drink happiness success you, Mr. Micawber, utmost pleasure.’ ‘And I too!’ said Agnes, smile. Mr. Micawber immediately descended bar, he appeared quite home; due time returned steaming jug. I could observe he peeling lemons his clasp-knife, which, became knife practical settler, foot long; he wiped, wholly without ostentation, sleeve his coat. Mrs. Micawber two elder members family I found provided similar formidable instruments, every child wooden spoon attached body strong line. In similar anticipation life afloat, Bush, Mr. Micawber, instead helping Mrs. Micawber his eldest son daughter punch, wine-glasses, he might easily done, shelf-full room, served series villainous little tin pots; I never saw enjoy anything much drinking his particular pint pot, putting his pocket close evening. ‘The luxuries old country,’ said Mr. Micawber, intense satisfaction renouncement, ‘we abandon. The denizens forest cannot, course, expect participate refinements land Free.’ Here, boy came say Mr. Micawber wanted downstairs. ‘I presentiment,’ said Mrs. Micawber, setting her tin pot, ‘that member family!’ ‘If so, dear,’ observed Mr. Micawber, his usual suddenness warmth subject, ‘as member family--whoever he, she, it, may be--has kept us waiting considerable period, perhaps Member may wait MY convenience.’ ‘Micawber,’ said his wife, low tone, ‘at time this--’ ‘“It meet,”’ said Mr. Micawber, rising, ‘“that every nice offence bear comment!” Emma, I stand reproved.’ ‘The loss, Micawber,’ observed his wife, ‘has family’s, yours. If family length sensible deprivation conduct has, past, exposed them, desire extend hand fellowship, let repulsed.’ ‘My dear,’ he returned, ‘so it!’ ‘If sakes; mine, Micawber,’ said his wife. ‘Emma,’ he returned, ‘that view question is, moment, irresistible. I cannot, even now, distinctly pledge fall upon family’s neck; member family, attendance, shall genial warmth frozen me.’ Mr. Micawber withdrew, absent little time; course Mrs. Micawber wholly free apprehension words might arisen Member. At length boy reappeared, presented note written pencil, headed, legal manner, ‘Heep v. Micawber’. From document, I learned Mr. Micawber arrested, ‘Was final paroxysm despair; he begged send his knife pint pot, bearer, might prove serviceable brief remainder his existence, jail. He also requested, last act friendship, I would see his family Parish Workhouse, forget Being ever lived. Of course I answered note going boy pay money, I found Mr. Micawber sitting corner, looking darkly Sheriff ‘s Officer effected capture. On his release, he embraced utmost fervour; made entry transaction his pocket-book--being particular, I recollect, halfpenny I inadvertently omitted statement total. This momentous pocket-book timely reminder another transaction. On return room upstairs (where he accounted his absence saying occasioned circumstances he control), he took large sheet paper, folded small, quite covered long sums, carefully worked. From glimpse I them, I say I never saw sums school ciphering-book. These, seemed, calculations compound interest he called ‘the principal amount forty-one, ten, eleven half’, various periods. After careful consideration these, elaborate estimate his resources, he come conclusion select sum represented amount compound interest two years, fifteen calendar months, fourteen days, date. For he drawn note-of-hand great neatness, he handed Traddles spot, discharge his debt full (as man man), many acknowledgements. ‘I still presentiment,’ said Mrs. Micawber, pensively shaking her head, ‘that family appear board, finally depart.’ Mr. Micawber evidently his presentiment subject too, he put his tin pot swallowed it. ‘If opportunity sending letters home, passage, Mrs. Micawber,’ said aunt, ‘you must let us hear you, know.’ ‘My dear Miss Trotwood,’ she replied, ‘I shall happy think anyone expects hear us. I shall fail correspond. Mr. Copperfield, I trust, old familiar friend, object receive occasional intelligence, himself, one knew twins yet unconscious?’ I said I hope hear, whenever she opportunity writing. ‘Please Heaven, many opportunities,’ said Mr. Micawber. ‘The ocean, times, perfect fleet ships; hardly fail encounter many, running over. It merely crossing,’ said Mr. Micawber, trifling his eye-glass, ‘merely crossing. The distance quite imaginary.’ I think, now, odd was, wonderfully like Mr. Micawber, that, he went London Canterbury, he talked he going farthest limits earth; and, he went England Australia, he going little trip across channel. ‘On voyage, I shall endeavour,’ said Mr. Micawber, ‘occasionally spin yarn; melody son Wilkins will, I trust, acceptable galley-fire. When Mrs. Micawber her sea-legs on--an expression I hope conventional impropriety--she give them, I dare say, “Little Tafflin”. Porpoises dolphins, I believe, frequently observed athwart Bows; and, either starboard larboard quarter, objects interest continually descried. In short,’ said Mr. Micawber, old genteel air, ‘the probability is, found exciting, alow aloft, lookout, stationed main-top, cries Land-oh! shall considerably astonished!’ With he flourished contents his little tin pot, he made voyage, passed first-class examination highest naval authorities. ‘What I chiefly hope, dear Mr. Copperfield,’ said Mrs. Micawber, ‘is, branches family may live old country. Do frown, Micawber! I refer family, children’s children. However vigorous sapling,’ said Mrs. Micawber, shaking her head, ‘I cannot forget parent-tree; race attains eminence fortune, I I wish fortune flow coffers Britannia.’ ‘My dear,’ said Mr. Micawber, ‘Britannia must take her chance. I bound say she never done much me, I particular wish upon subject.’ ‘Micawber,’ returned Mrs. Micawber, ‘there, wrong. You going out, Micawber, distant clime, strengthen, weaken, connexion Albion.’ ‘The connexion question, love,’ rejoined Mr. Micawber, ‘has laid me, I repeat, load personal obligation, I sensitive formation another connexion.’ ‘Micawber,’ returned Mrs. Micawber. ‘There, I say, wrong. You know power, Micawber. It strengthen, even step take, connexion Albion.’ Mr. Micawber sat his elbow-chair, his eyebrows raised; half receiving half repudiating Mrs. Micawber’s views stated, sensible foresight. ‘My dear Mr. Copperfield,’ said Mrs. Micawber, ‘I wish Mr. Micawber feel his position. It appears highly important Mr. Micawber should, hour his embarkation, feel his position. Your old knowledge me, dear Mr. Copperfield, told I sanguine disposition Mr. Micawber. My disposition is, I may say so, eminently practical. I know long voyage. I know involve many privations inconveniences. I cannot shut eyes facts. But I also know Mr. Micawber is. I know latent power Mr. Micawber. And therefore I consider vitally important Mr. Micawber feel his position.’ ‘My love,’ he observed, ‘perhaps allow remark barely possible I DO feel position present moment.’ ‘I think not, Micawber,’ she rejoined. ‘Not fully. My dear Mr. Copperfield, Mr. Micawber’s common case. Mr. Micawber going distant country expressly order he may fully understood appreciated first time. I wish Mr. Micawber take his stand upon vessel’s prow, firmly say, “This country I come conquer! Have honours? Have riches? Have posts profitable pecuniary emolument? Let brought forward. They mine!”’ Mr. Micawber, glancing us all, seemed think good deal idea. ‘I wish Mr. Micawber, I make understood,’ said Mrs. Micawber, her argumentative tone, ‘to Caesar his fortunes. That, dear Mr. Copperfield, appears his true position. From first moment voyage, I wish Mr. Micawber stand upon vessel’s prow say, “Enough delay: enough disappointment: enough limited means. That old country. This new. Produce reparation. Bring forward!”’ Mr. Micawber folded his arms resolute manner, he stationed figure-head. ‘And that,’ said Mrs. Micawber, ‘--feeling his position--am I right saying Mr. Micawber strengthen, weaken, his connexion Britain? An important public character arising hemisphere, shall I told influence felt home? Can I weak imagine Mr. Micawber, wielding rod talent power Australia, nothing England? I woman; I unworthy papa, I guilty absurd weakness.’ Mrs. Micawber’s conviction her arguments unanswerable, gave moral elevation her tone I think I never heard before. ‘And therefore is,’ said Mrs. Micawber, ‘that I wish, that, future period, may live parent soil. Mr. Micawber may be--I cannot disguise probability is, Mr. Micawber be--a page History; he ought represented country gave birth, NOT give employment!’ ‘My love,’ observed Mr. Micawber, ‘it impossible touched affection. I always willing defer good sense. What be--will be. Heaven forbid I grudge native country portion wealth may accumulated descendants!’ ‘That is well,’ said aunt, nodding towards Mr. Peggotty, ‘and I drink love all, every blessing success attend you!’ Mr. Peggotty put two children he nursing, one knee, join Mr. Mrs. Micawber drinking us return; he Micawbers cordially shook hands comrades, his brown face brightened smile, I felt he would make his way, establish good name, beloved, go he would. Even children instructed, dip wooden spoon Mr. Micawber’s pot, pledge us contents. When done, aunt Agnes rose, parted emigrants. It sorrowful farewell. They crying; children hung Agnes last; left poor Mrs. Micawber distressed condition, sobbing weeping dim candle, must made room look, river, like miserable light-house. I went next morning see away. They departed, boat, early five of the clock. It wonderful instance gap partings make, although association tumble-down public-house wooden stairs dated last night, seemed dreary deserted, gone. In afternoon next day, old nurse I went Gravesend. We found ship river, surrounded crowd boats; favourable wind blowing; signal sailing her mast-head. I hired boat directly, put her; getting little vortex confusion she centre, went board. Mr. Peggotty waiting us deck. He told Mr. Micawber arrested (and last time) suit Heep, that, compliance request I made him, he paid money, I repaid him. He took us decks; there, lingering fears I his heard rumours happened, dispelled Mr. Micawber’s coming gloom, taking his arm air friendship protection, telling scarcely asunder moment, since night last. It strange scene me, confined dark, that, first, I could make hardly anything; but, degrees, cleared, eyes became accustomed gloom, I seemed stand picture OSTADE. Among great beams, bulks, ringbolts ship, emigrant-berths, chests, bundles, barrels, heaps miscellaneous baggage--‘lighted up, there, dangling lanterns; elsewhere yellow daylight straying windsail hatchway--were crowded groups people, making new friendships, taking leave one another, talking, laughing, crying, eating drinking; some, already settled possession feet space, little households arranged, tiny children established stools, dwarf elbow-chairs; others, despairing resting-place, wandering disconsolately. From babies week two life behind them, crooked old men women seemed week two life them; ploughmen bodily carrying soil England boots, smiths taking away samples soot smoke upon skins; every age occupation appeared crammed narrow compass ‘tween decks. As eye glanced round place, I thought I saw sitting, open port, one Micawber children near her, figure like Emily’s; first attracted attention, another figure parting kiss; glided calmly away disorder, reminding of--Agnes! But rapid motion confusion, unsettlement thoughts, I lost again; knew time come visitors warned leave ship; nurse crying chest beside me; Mrs. Gummidge, assisted younger stooping woman black, busily arranging Mr. Peggotty’s goods. ‘Is last wured, Mas’r Davy?’ said he. ‘Is one forgotten thing afore parts?’ ‘One thing!’ said I. ‘Martha!’ He touched younger woman I mentioned shoulder, Martha stood me. ‘Heaven bless you, good man!’ cried I. ‘You take her you!’ She answered him, burst tears. I could speak time, I wrung his hand; ever I loved honoured man, I loved honoured man soul. The ship clearing fast strangers. The greatest trial I had, remained. I told noble spirit gone, given charge say parting. It moved deeply. But he charged me, return, many messages affection regret deaf ears, he moved more. The time come. I embraced him, took weeping nurse upon arm, hurried away. On deck, I took leave poor Mrs. Micawber. She looking distractedly her family, even then; her last words were, she never would desert Mr. Micawber. We went side boat, lay little distance, see ship wafted her course. It calm, radiant sunset. She lay us, red light; every taper line spar visible glow. A sight beautiful, mournful, hopeful, glorious ship, lying, still, flushed water, life board her crowded bulwarks, clustering, moment, bare-headed silent, I never saw. Silent, moment. As sails rose wind, ship began move, broke boats three resounding cheers, board took up, echoed back, echoed re-echoed. My heart burst I heard sound, beheld waving hats handkerchiefs--and I saw her! Then I saw her, her uncle’s side, trembling his shoulder. He pointed us eager hand; she saw us, waved her last good-bye me. Aye, Emily, beautiful drooping, cling utmost trust thy bruised heart; he clung thee, might his great love! Surrounded rosy light, standing high upon deck, apart together, she clinging him, he holding her, solemnly passed away. The night fallen Kentish hills rowed ashore--and fallen darkly upon me. CHAPTER 58. ABSENCE It long gloomy night gathered me, haunted ghosts many hopes, many dear remembrances, many errors, many unavailing sorrows regrets. I went away England; knowing, even then, great shock was, I bear. I left dear me, went away; believed I borne it, past. As man upon field battle receive mortal hurt, scarcely know he struck, I, I left alone undisciplined heart, conception wound strive. The knowledge came upon me, quickly, little little, grain grain. The desolate feeling I went abroad, deepened widened hourly. At first heavy sense loss sorrow, wherein I could distinguish little else. By imperceptible degrees, became hopeless consciousness I lost--love, friendship, interest; shattered--my first trust, first affection, whole airy castle life; remained--a ruined blank waste, lying wide around me, unbroken, dark horizon. If grief selfish, I know so. I mourned child-wife, taken her blooming world, young. I mourned might love admiration thousands, he mine long ago. I mourned broken heart found rest stormy sea; wandering remnants simple home, I heard night-wind blowing, I child. From accumulated sadness I fell, I length hope ever issuing again. I roamed place place, carrying burden everywhere. I felt whole weight now; I drooped beneath it, I said heart could never lightened. When despondency worst, I believed I die. Sometimes, I thought I would like die home; actually turned back road, I might get soon. At times, I passed farther away,--from city city, seeking I know what, trying leave I know behind. It power retrace, one one, weary phases distress mind I passed. There dreams imperfectly vaguely described; I oblige look back time life, I seem recalling dream. I see passing among novelties foreign towns, palaces, cathedrals, temples, pictures, castles, tombs, fantastic streets--the old abiding places History Fancy--as dreamer might; bearing painful load all, hardly conscious objects fade me. Listlessness everything, brooding sorrow, night fell undisciplined heart. Let look it--as last I did, thank Heaven!--and long, sad, wretched dream, dawn. For many months I travelled ever-darkening cloud upon mind. Some blind reasons I returning home--reasons struggling within me, vainly, distinct expression--kept pilgrimage. Sometimes, I proceeded restlessly place place, stopping nowhere; sometimes, I lingered long one spot. I purpose, sustaining soul within me, anywhere. I Switzerland. I come Italy, one great passes Alps, since wandered guide among by-ways mountains. If awful solitudes spoken heart, I know it. I found sublimity wonder dread heights precipices, roaring torrents, wastes ice snow; yet, taught nothing else. I came, one evening sunset, valley, I rest. In course descent it, winding track along mountain-side, I saw shining far below, I think long-unwonted sense beauty tranquillity, softening influence awakened peace, moved faintly breast. I remember pausing once, kind sorrow oppressive, quite despairing. I remember almost hoping better change possible within me. I came valley, evening sun shining remote heights snow, closed in, like eternal clouds. The bases mountains forming gorge little village lay, richly green; high gentler vegetation, grew forests dark fir, cleaving wintry snow-drift, wedge-like, stemming avalanche. Above these, range upon range craggy steeps, grey rock, bright ice, smooth verdure-specks pasture, gradually blending crowning snow. Dotted mountain’s-side, tiny dot home, lonely wooden cottages, dwarfed towering heights appeared small toys. So even clustered village valley, wooden bridge across stream, stream tumbled broken rocks, roared away among trees. In quiet air, sound distant singing--shepherd voices; but, one bright evening cloud floated midway along mountain’s-side, I could almost believed came there, earthly music. All once, serenity, great Nature spoke me; soothed lay weary head upon grass, weep I wept yet, since Dora died! I found packet letters awaiting minutes before, strolled village read supper making ready. Other packets missed me, I received none long time. Beyond line two, say I well, arrived place, I fortitude constancy write letter since I left home. The packet hand. I opened it, read writing Agnes. She happy useful, prospering she hoped. That she told herself. The rest referred me. She gave advice; she urged duty me; she told me, her fervent manner, her trust was. She knew (she said) nature mine would turn affliction good. She knew trial emotion would exalt strengthen it. She sure every purpose I gain firmer higher tendency, grief I undergone. She, gloried fame, looked forward augmentation, well knew I would labour on. She knew me, sorrow could weakness, must strength. As endurance childish days done part make I was, greater calamities would nerve on, yet better I was; so, taught me, would I teach others. She commended God, taken innocent darling His rest; her sisterly affection cherished always, always side go I would; proud I done, infinitely prouder yet I reserved do. I put letter breast, thought I hour ago! When I heard voices die away, saw quiet evening cloud grow dim, colours valley fade, golden snow upon mountain-tops become remote part pale night sky, yet felt night passing mind, shadows clearing, name love I bore her, dearer me, henceforward, ever then. I read her letter many times. I wrote her I slept. I told her I sore need her help; without her I not, I never been, she thought me; she inspired that, I would try. I try. In three months more, year would passed since beginning sorrow. I determined make resolutions expiration three months, try. I lived valley, neighbourhood, time. The three months gone, I resolved remain away home time longer; settle present Switzerland, growing dear remembrance evening; resume pen; work. I resorted humbly whither Agnes commended me; I sought Nature, never sought vain; I admitted breast human interest I lately shrunk from. It long, I almost many friends valley Yarmouth: I left it, winter set in, Geneva, came back spring, cordial greetings homely sound me, although conveyed English words. I worked early late, patiently hard. I wrote Story, purpose growing, remotely, experience, sent Traddles, he arranged publication advantageously me; tidings growing reputation began reach travellers I encountered chance. After rest change, I fell work, old ardent way, new fancy, took strong possession me. As I advanced execution task, I felt more, roused utmost energies well. This third work fiction. It half written, when, interval rest, I thought returning home. For long time, though studying working patiently, I accustomed robust exercise. My health, severely impaired I left England, quite restored. I seen much. I many countries, I hope I improved store knowledge. I recalled I think needful recall here, term absence--with one reservation. I made it, thus far, purpose suppressing thoughts; for, I elsewhere said, narrative written memory. I desired keep secret current mind apart, last. I enter now. I cannot completely penetrate mystery heart, know I began think I might set earliest brightest hopes Agnes. I cannot say stage grief first became associated reflection, that, wayward boyhood, I thrown away treasure her love. I believe I may heard whisper distant thought, old unhappy loss want something never realized, I sensible. But thought came mind new reproach new regret, I left sad lonely world. If, time, I much her, I should, weakness desolation, betrayed this. It I remotely dreaded I first impelled stay away England. I could borne lose smallest portion her sisterly affection; yet, betrayal, I set constraint us hitherto unknown. I could forget feeling she regarded grown free choice course. That she ever loved another love--and I sometimes thought time she might done so--I cast away. It nothing, now, I accustomed think her, mere children, one far removed wild fancies. I bestowed passionate tenderness upon another object; I might done, I done; Agnes me, I her noble heart made her. In beginning change gradually worked me, I tried get better understanding better man, I glance, indefinite probation, period I might possibly hope cancel mistaken past, blessed marry her. But, time wore on, shadowy prospect faded, departed me. If she ever loved me, then, I hold her sacred; remembering confidences I reposed her, her knowledge errant heart, sacrifice she must made friend sister, victory she won. If she never loved me, could I believe she would love now? I always felt weakness, comparison her constancy fortitude; I felt more. Whatever I might her, she me, I worthy her long ago, I now, she not. The time past. I let go by, deservedly lost her. That I suffered much contentions, filled unhappiness remorse, yet I sustaining sense required me, right honour, keep away myself, shame, thought turning dear girl withering hopes, I frivolously turned bright fresh--which consideration root every thought I concerning her--is equally true. I made effort conceal myself, now, I loved her, I devoted her; I brought assurance home myself, late, long-subsisting relation must undisturbed. I thought, much often, Dora’s shadowing might happened, years destined try us; I considered things never happen, often much realities us, effects, accomplished. The years she spoke of, realities now, correction; would been, one day, little later perhaps, though parted earliest folly. I endeavoured convert might Agnes, means making self-denying, resolved, conscious myself, defects errors. Thus, reflection might been, I arrived conviction could never be. These, perplexities inconsistencies, shifting quicksands mind, time departure time return home, three years afterwards. Three years elapsed since sailing emigrant ship; when, hour sunset, place, I stood deck packet vessel brought home, looking rosy water I seen image ship reflected. Three years. Long aggregate, though short went by. And home dear me, Agnes too--but she mine--she never mine. She might been, past! CHAPTER 59. RETURN I landed London wintry autumn evening. It dark raining, I saw fog mud minute I seen year. I walked Custom House Monument I found coach; although house-fronts, looking swollen gutters, like old friends me, I could admit dingy friends. I often remarked--I suppose everybody has--that one’s going away familiar place, would seem signal change it. As I looked coach window, observed old house Fish-street Hill, stood untouched painter, carpenter, bricklayer, century, pulled absence; neighbouring street, time-honoured insalubrity inconvenience, drained widened; I half expected find St. Paul’s Cathedral looking older. For changes fortunes friends, I prepared. My aunt long re-established Dover, Traddles begun get little practice Bar, first term departure. He chambers Gray’s Inn, now; told me, his last letters, he without hopes soon united dearest girl world. They expected home Christmas; idea returning soon. I purposely misled them, I might pleasure taking surprise. And yet, I perverse enough feel chill disappointment receiving welcome, rattling, alone silent, misty streets. The well-known shops, however, cheerful lights, something me; I alighted door Gray’s Inn Coffee-house, I recovered spirits. It recalled, first, so-different time I put Golden Cross, reminded changes come pass since then; natural. ‘Do know Mr. Traddles lives Inn?’ I asked waiter, I warmed coffee-room fire. ‘Holborn Court, sir. Number two.’ ‘Mr. Traddles rising reputation among lawyers, I believe?’ said I. ‘Well, sir,’ returned waiter, ‘probably he has, sir; I aware myself.’ This waiter, middle-aged spare, looked help waiter authority--a stout, potential old man, double chin, black breeches stockings, came place like churchwarden’s pew, end coffee-room, he kept company cash-box, Directory, Law-list, books papers. ‘Mr. Traddles,’ said spare waiter. ‘Number two Court.’ The potential waiter waved away, turned, gravely, me. ‘I inquiring,’ said I, ‘whether Mr. Traddles, number two Court, rising reputation among lawyers?’ ‘Never heard his name,’ said waiter, rich husky voice. I felt quite apologetic Traddles. ‘He is young man, sure?’ said portentous waiter, fixing his eyes severely me. ‘How long he Inn?’ ‘Not three years,’ said I. The waiter, I supposed lived his churchwarden’s pew forty years, could pursue insignificant subject. He asked I would dinner? I felt I England again, really quite cast Traddles’s account. There seemed hope him. I meekly ordered bit fish steak, stood fire musing his obscurity. As I followed chief waiter eyes, I could help thinking garden he gradually blown flower he was, arduous place rise in. It prescriptive, stiff-necked, long-established, solemn, elderly air. I glanced room, sanded floor sanded, doubt, exactly manner chief waiter boy--if he ever boy, appeared improbable; shining tables, I saw reflected, unruffled depths old mahogany; lamps, without flaw trimming cleaning; comfortable green curtains, pure brass rods, snugly enclosing boxes; two large coal fires, brightly burning; rows decanters, burly consciousness pipes expensive old port wine below; England, law, appeared difficult indeed taken storm. I went bedroom change wet clothes; vast extent old wainscoted apartment (which archway leading Inn, I remember), sedate immensity four-post bedstead, indomitable gravity chests drawers, seemed unite sternly frowning fortunes Traddles, daring youth. I came dinner; even slow comfort meal, orderly silence place--which bare guests, Long Vacation yet over--were eloquent audacity Traddles, his small hopes livelihood twenty years come. I seen nothing like since I went away, quite dashed hopes friend. The chief waiter enough me. He came near more; devoted old gentleman long gaiters, meet pint special port seemed come cellar accord, he gave order. The second waiter informed me, whisper, old gentleman retired conveyancer living Square, worth mint money, expected he would leave his laundress’s daughter; likewise rumoured he service plate bureau, tarnished lying by, though one spoon fork never yet beheld his chambers mortal vision. By time, I quite gave Traddles lost; settled mind hope him. Being anxious see dear old fellow, nevertheless, I dispatched dinner, manner calculated raise opinion chief waiter, hurried back way. Number two Court soon reached; inscription door-post informing Mr. Traddles occupied set chambers top storey, I ascended staircase. A crazy old staircase I found be, feebly lighted landing club-headed little oil wick, dying away little dungeon dirty glass. In course stumbling upstairs, I fancied I heard pleasant sound laughter; laughter attorney barrister, attorney’s clerk barrister’s clerk, two three merry girls. Happening, however, I stopped listen, put foot hole Honourable Society Gray’s Inn left plank deficient, I fell noise, I recovered footing silent. Groping way carefully, rest journey, heart beat high I found outer door, Mr. TRADDLES painted it, open. I knocked. A considerable scuffling within ensued, nothing else. I therefore knocked again. A small sharp-looking lad, half-footboy half-clerk, much breath, looked he defied prove legally, presented himself. ‘Is Mr. Traddles within?’ I said. ‘Yes, sir, he is engaged.’ ‘I want see him.’ After moment’s survey me, sharp-looking lad decided let in; opening door wider purpose, admitted me, first, little closet hall, next little sitting-room; I came presence old friend (also breath), seated table, bending papers. ‘Good God!’ cried Traddles, looking up. ‘It is Copperfield!’ rushed arms, I held tight. ‘All well, dear Traddles?’ ‘All well, dear, dear Copperfield, nothing good news!’ We cried pleasure, us. ‘My dear fellow,’ said Traddles, rumpling his hair his excitement, unnecessary operation, ‘my dearest Copperfield, long-lost welcome friend, glad I see you! How brown are! How glad I am! Upon life honour, I never rejoiced, beloved Copperfield, never!’ I equally loss express emotions. I quite unable speak, first. ‘My dear fellow!’ said Traddles. ‘And grown famous! My glorious Copperfield! Good gracious me, WHEN come, WHERE come from, WHAT doing?’ Never pausing answer anything he said, Traddles, clapped easy-chair fire, time impetuously stirred fire one hand, pulled neck-kerchief other, wild delusion great-coat. Without putting poker, he hugged again; I hugged him; and, laughing, wiping eyes, sat down, shook hands across hearth. ‘To think,’ said Traddles, ‘that nearly coming home must been, dear old boy, ceremony!’ ‘What ceremony, dear Traddles?’ ‘Good gracious me!’ cried Traddles, opening his eyes his old way. ‘Did not get last letter?’ ‘Certainly not, referred ceremony.’ ‘Why, dear Copperfield,’ said Traddles, sticking his hair upright hands, putting his hands knees, ‘I married!’ ‘Married!’ I cried joyfully. ‘Lord bless me, yes!’ said Traddles--‘by Reverend Horace--to Sophy--down Devonshire. Why, dear boy, she is behind window curtain! Look here!’ To amazement, dearest girl world came instant, laughing blushing, her place concealment. And cheerful, amiable, honest, happy, bright-looking bride, I believe (as I could help saying spot) world never saw. I kissed her old acquaintance should, wished joy might heart. ‘Dear me,’ said Traddles, ‘what delightful re-union is! You extremely brown, dear Copperfield! God bless soul, happy I am!’ ‘And I,’ said I. ‘And I sure I am!’ said blushing laughing Sophy. ‘We happy possible!’ said Traddles. ‘Even girls happy. Dear me, I declare I forgot them!’ ‘Forgot?’ said I. ‘The girls,’ said Traddles. ‘Sophy’s sisters. They staying us. They come peep London. The fact is, when--was tumbled upstairs, Copperfield?’ ‘It was,’ said I, laughing. ‘Well then, tumbled upstairs,’ said Traddles, ‘I romping girls. In point fact, playing Puss Corner. But would not Westminster Hall, would not look quite professional seen client, decamped. And now--listening, I doubt,’ said Traddles, glancing door another room. ‘I sorry,’ said I, laughing afresh, ‘to occasioned dispersion.’ ‘Upon word,’ rejoined Traddles, greatly delighted, ‘if seen running away, running back again, knocked, pick combs dropped hair, going maddest manner, would not said so. My love, fetch girls?’ Sophy tripped away, heard her received adjoining room peal laughter. ‘Really musical, is not it, dear Copperfield?’ said Traddles. ‘It is agreeable hear. It quite lights old rooms. To unfortunate bachelor fellow lived alone his life, know, it is positively delicious. It is charming. Poor things, great loss Sophy--who, I assure you, Copperfield is, ever was, dearest girl!--and gratifies beyond expression find good spirits. The society girls delightful thing, Copperfield. It is professional, it is delightful.’ Observing he slightly faltered, comprehending goodness his heart he fearful giving pain he said, I expressed concurrence heartiness evidently relieved pleased greatly. ‘But then,’ said Traddles, ‘our domestic arrangements are, say truth, quite unprofessional altogether, dear Copperfield. Even Sophy’s here, unprofessional. And place abode. We put sea cockboat, quite prepared rough it. And Sophy’s extraordinary manager! You will surprised girls stowed away. I sure I hardly know it is done!’ ‘Are many young ladies you?’ I inquired. ‘The eldest, Beauty here,’ said Traddles, low confidential voice, ‘Caroline. And Sarah’s here--the one I mentioned something matter her spine, know. Immensely better! And two youngest Sophy educated us. And Louisa’s here.’ ‘Indeed!’ cried I. ‘Yes,’ said Traddles. ‘Now whole set--I mean chambers--is three rooms; Sophy arranges girls wonderful way, sleep comfortably possible. Three room,’ said Traddles, pointing. ‘Two that.’ I could help glancing round, search accommodation remaining Mr. Mrs. Traddles. Traddles understood me. ‘Well!’ said Traddles, ‘we prepared rough it, I said now, improvise bed last week, upon floor here. But there is little room roof--a nice room, you are there--which Sophy papered herself, surprise me; that is room present. It is capital little gipsy sort place. There is quite view it.’ ‘And happily married last, dear Traddles!’ said I. ‘How rejoiced I am!’ ‘Thank you, dear Copperfield,’ said Traddles, shook hands more. ‘Yes, I happy it is possible be. There is old friend, see,’ said Traddles, nodding triumphantly flower-pot stand; ‘and there is table marble top! All furniture plain serviceable, perceive. And plate, Lord bless you, have not much tea-spoon.’ ‘All earned?’ said I, cheerfully. ‘Exactly so,’ replied Traddles, ‘all earned. Of course something shape tea-spoons, stir tea. But they are Britannia metal.’ ‘The silver brighter comes,’ said I. ‘The thing say!’ cried Traddles. ‘You see, dear Copperfield,’ falling low confidential tone, ‘after I delivered argument DOE dem. JIPES versus WIGZIELL, great service profession, I went Devonshire, serious conversation private Reverend Horace. I dwelt upon fact Sophy--who I assure you, Copperfield, dearest girl!--’ ‘I certain she is!’ said I. ‘She is, indeed!’ rejoined Traddles. ‘But I afraid I wandering subject. Did I mention Reverend Horace?’ ‘You said dwelt upon fact--’ ‘True! Upon fact Sophy I engaged long period, Sophy, permission her parents, content take me--in short,’ said Traddles, his old frank smile, ‘on present Britannia-metal footing. Very well. I proposed Reverend Horace--who excellent clergyman, Copperfield, ought Bishop; least ought enough live upon, without pinching himself--that I could turn corner, say two hundred fifty pounds, one year; could see way pretty clearly that, something better, next year; could plainly furnish little place like this, besides; then, case, Sophy I united. I took liberty representing patient good many years; circumstance Sophy’s extraordinarily useful home, ought operate her affectionate parents, her establishment life--do not see?’ ‘Certainly ought not,’ said I. ‘I glad think so, Copperfield,’ rejoined Traddles, ‘because, without imputation Reverend Horace, I think parents, brothers, forth, sometimes rather selfish cases. Well! I also pointed out, earnest desire was, useful family; I got world, anything happen him--I refer Reverend Horace--’ ‘I understand,’ said I. ‘--Or Mrs. Crewler--it would utmost gratification wishes, parent girls. He replied admirable manner, exceedingly flattering feelings, undertook obtain consent Mrs. Crewler arrangement. They dreadful time her. It mounted her legs her chest, her head--’ ‘What mounted?’ I asked. ‘Her grief,’ replied Traddles, serious look. ‘Her feelings generally. As I mentioned former occasion, she superior woman, lost use her limbs. Whatever occurs harass her, usually settles her legs; occasion mounted chest, head, and, short, pervaded whole system alarming manner. However, brought her unremitting affectionate attention; married yesterday six weeks. You idea Monster I felt, Copperfield, I saw whole family crying fainting away every direction! Mrs. Crewler could not see left--could not forgive me, then, depriving her her child--but she good creature, done since. I delightful letter her, morning.’ ‘And short, dear friend,’ said I, ‘you feel blest deserve feel!’ ‘Oh! That is partiality!’ laughed Traddles. ‘But, indeed, I enviable state. I work hard, read Law insatiably. I get five every morning, do not mind all. I hide girls daytime, make merry evening. And I assure I quite sorry going home Tuesday, day first day Michaelmas Term. But here,’ said Traddles, breaking his confidence, speaking aloud, ‘ARE girls! Mr. Copperfield, Miss Crewler--Miss Sarah--Miss Louisa--Margaret Lucy!’ They perfect nest roses; looked wholesome fresh. They pretty, Miss Caroline handsome; loving, cheerful, fireside quality Sophy’s bright looks, better that, assured friend chosen well. We sat round fire; sharp boy, I divined lost his breath putting papers out, cleared away again, produced tea-things. After that, he retired night, shutting outer door upon us bang. Mrs. Traddles, perfect pleasure composure beaming her household eyes, made tea, quietly made toast she sat corner fire. She seen Agnes, she told she toasting. ‘Tom’ taken her Kent wedding trip, she seen aunt, too; aunt Agnes well, talked nothing me. ‘Tom’ never his thoughts, she really believed, time I away. ‘Tom’ authority everything. ‘Tom’ evidently idol her life; never shaken his pedestal commotion; always believed in, done homage whole faith her heart, come might. The deference she Traddles showed towards Beauty, pleased much. I do not know I thought reasonable; I thought delightful, essentially part character. If Traddles ever instant missed tea-spoons still won, I doubt he handed Beauty her tea. If his sweet-tempered wife could got self-assertion anyone, I satisfied could she Beauty’s sister. A slight indications rather petted capricious manner, I observed Beauty, manifestly considered, Traddles his wife, her birthright natural endowment. If she born Queen Bee, labouring Bees, could satisfied that. But self-forgetfulness charmed me. Their pride girls, submission whims, pleasantest little testimony worth I could desired see. If Traddles addressed ‘a darling’, course evening; besought bring something here, carry something there, take something up, put something down, find something, fetch something, he addressed, one his sisters-in-law, least twelve times hour. Neither could anything without Sophy. Somebody is hair fell down, nobody Sophy could put up. Somebody forgot particular tune went, nobody Sophy could hum tune right. Somebody wanted recall name place Devonshire, Sophy knew it. Something wanted written home, Sophy alone could trusted write breakfast morning. Somebody broke piece knitting, one Sophy able put defaulter right direction. They entire mistresses place, Sophy Traddles waited them. How many children Sophy could taken care her time, I cannot imagine; she seemed famous knowing every sort song ever addressed child English tongue; she sang dozens order clearest little voice world, one another (every sister issuing directions different tune, Beauty generally striking last), I quite fascinated. The best was, that, midst exactions, sisters great tenderness respect Sophy Traddles. I sure, I took leave, Traddles coming walk coffee-house, I thought I never seen obstinate head hair, head hair, rolling shower kisses. Altogether, scene I could help dwelling pleasure, long time I got back wished Traddles good night. If I beheld thousand roses blowing top set chambers, withered Gray’s Inn, could brightened half much. The idea Devonshire girls, among dry law-stationers attorneys’ offices; tea toast, children’s songs, grim atmosphere pounce parchment, red-tape, dusty wafers, ink-jars, brief draft paper, law reports, writs, declarations, bills costs; seemed almost pleasantly fanciful I dreamed Sultan’s famous family admitted roll attorneys, brought talking bird, singing tree, golden water Gray’s Inn Hall. Somehow, I found I taken leave Traddles night, come back coffee-house, great change despondency him. I began think he would get on, spite many orders chief waiters England. Drawing chair one coffee-room fires think leisure, I gradually fell consideration his happiness tracing prospects live-coals, thinking, broke changed, principal vicissitudes separations marked life. I seen coal fire, since I left England three years ago: though many wood fire I watched, crumbled hoary ashes, mingled feathery heap upon hearth, inaptly figured me, despondency, dead hopes. I could think past now, gravely, bitterly; could contemplate future brave spirit. Home, best sense, more. She I might inspired dearer love, I taught sister. She would marry, would new claimants her tenderness; it, would never know love her grown heart. It right I pay forfeit headlong passion. What I reaped, I sown. I thinking. And I truly disciplined heart this, could I resolutely bear it, calmly hold place her home she calmly held mine,--when I found eyes resting countenance might arisen fire, association early remembrances. Little Mr. Chillip Doctor, whose good offices I indebted first chapter history, sat reading newspaper shadow opposite corner. He tolerably stricken years time; but, mild, meek, calm little man, worn easily, I thought he looked moment he might looked he sat parlour, waiting born. Mr. Chillip left Blunderstone six seven years ago, I never seen since. He sat placidly perusing newspaper, his little head one side, glass warm sherry negus his elbow. He extremely conciliatory his manner he seemed apologize newspaper taking liberty reading it. I walked he sitting, said, ‘How do, Mr. Chillip?’ He greatly fluttered unexpected address stranger, replied, his slow way, ‘I thank you, sir, good. Thank you, sir. I hope YOU well.’ ‘You do not remember me?’ said I. ‘Well, sir,’ returned Mr. Chillip, smiling meekly, shaking his head he surveyed me, ‘I kind impression something countenance familiar me, sir; I could not lay hand upon name, really.’ ‘And yet knew it, long I knew myself,’ I returned. ‘Did I indeed, sir?’ said Mr. Chillip. ‘Is possible I honour, sir, officiating when--?’ ‘Yes,’ said I. ‘Dear me!’ cried Mr. Chillip. ‘But doubt good deal changed since then, sir?’ ‘Probably,’ said I. ‘Well, sir,’ observed Mr. Chillip, ‘I hope you will excuse me, I compelled ask favour name?’ On telling name, he really moved. He quite shook hands me--which violent proceeding him, his usual course slide tepid little fish-slice, inch two advance his hip, evince greatest discomposure anybody grappled it. Even now, he put his hand his coat-pocket soon he could disengage it, seemed relieved he got safe back. ‘Dear me, sir!’ said Mr. Chillip, surveying his head one side. ‘And it is Mr. Copperfield, it? Well, sir, I think I known you, I taken liberty looking closely you. There is strong resemblance poor father, sir.’ ‘I never happiness seeing father,’ I observed. ‘Very true, sir,’ said Mr. Chillip, soothing tone. ‘And much deplored was, accounts! We ignorant, sir,’ said Mr. Chillip, slowly shaking his little head again, ‘down part country, fame. There must great excitement here, sir,’ said Mr. Chillip, tapping forehead his forefinger. ‘You must find trying occupation, sir!’ ‘What part country now?’ I asked, seating near him. ‘I established within miles Bury St. Edmund’s, sir,’ said Mr. Chillip. ‘Mrs. Chillip, coming little property neighbourhood, her father’s will, I bought practice there, glad hear I well. My daughter growing quite tall lass now, sir,’ said Mr. Chillip, giving his little head another little shake. ‘Her mother let two tucks her frocks last week. Such time, see, sir!’ As little man put his empty glass his lips, he made reflection, I proposed refilled, I would keep company another. ‘Well, sir,’ he returned, his slow way, ‘it is I accustomed to; I cannot deny pleasure conversation. It seems yesterday I honour attending measles. You came charmingly, sir!’ I acknowledged compliment, ordered negus, soon produced. ‘Quite uncommon dissipation!’ said Mr. Chillip, stirring it, ‘but I cannot resist extraordinary occasion. You family, sir?’ I shook head. ‘I aware sustained bereavement, sir, time ago,’ said Mr. Chillip. ‘I heard father-in-law’s sister. Very decided character there, sir?’ ‘Why, yes,’ said I, ‘decided enough. Where see her, Mr. Chillip?’ ‘Are aware, sir,’ returned Mr. Chillip, his placidest smile, ‘that father-in-law neighbour mine?’ ‘No,’ said I. ‘He indeed, sir!’ said Mr. Chillip. ‘Married young lady part, good little property, poor thing.---And action brain now, sir? Do not find fatigue you?’ said Mr. Chillip, looking like admiring Robin. I waived question, returned Murdstones. ‘I aware his married again. Do attend family?’ I asked. ‘Not regularly. I called in,’ he replied. ‘Strong phrenological developments organ firmness, Mr. Murdstone his sister, sir.’ I replied expressive look, Mr. Chillip emboldened that, negus together, give his head several short shakes, thoughtfully exclaim, ‘Ah, dear me! We remember old times, Mr. Copperfield!’ ‘And brother sister pursuing old course, they?’ said I. ‘Well, sir,’ replied Mr. Chillip, ‘a medical man, much families, ought neither eyes ears anything his profession. Still, I must say, severe, sir: life next.’ ‘The next regulated without much reference them, I dare say,’ I returned: ‘what this?’ Mr. Chillip shook his head, stirred his negus, sipped it. ‘She charming woman, sir!’ he observed plaintive manner. ‘The present Mrs. Murdstone?’ ‘A charming woman indeed, sir,’ said Mr. Chillip; ‘as amiable, I sure, possible be! Mrs. Chillip’s opinion is, her spirit entirely broken since her marriage, she melancholy mad. And ladies,’ observed Mr. Chillip, timorously, ‘are great observers, sir.’ ‘I suppose she subdued broken detestable mould, Heaven help her!’ said I. ‘And she been.’ ‘Well, sir, violent quarrels first, I assure you,’ said Mr. Chillip; ‘but she quite shadow now. Would considered forward I say you, sir, confidence, since sister came help, brother sister nearly reduced her state imbecility?’ I told I could easily believe it. ‘I hesitation saying,’ said Mr. Chillip, fortifying another sip negus, ‘between me, sir, her mother died it--or tyranny, gloom, worry made Mrs. Murdstone nearly imbecile. She lively young woman, sir, marriage, gloom austerity destroyed her. They go her, now, like her keepers her husband sister-in-law. That Mrs. Chillip’s remark me, last week. And I assure you, sir, ladies great observers. Mrs. Chillip herself great observer!’ ‘Does he gloomily profess (I ashamed use word association) religious still?’ I inquired. ‘You anticipate, sir,’ said Mr. Chillip, his eyelids getting quite red unwonted stimulus he indulging. ‘One Mrs. Chillip’s impressive remarks. Mrs. Chillip,’ he proceeded, calmest slowest manner, ‘quite electrified me, pointing Mr. Murdstone sets image himself, calls Divine Nature. You might knocked flat back, sir, feather pen, I assure you, Mrs. Chillip said so. The ladies great observers, sir?’ ‘Intuitively,’ said I, his extreme delight. ‘I happy receive support opinion, sir,’ he rejoined. ‘It often I venture give non-medical opinion, I assure you. Mr. Murdstone delivers public addresses sometimes, said,--in short, sir, said Mrs. Chillip,--that darker tyrant he lately been, ferocious his doctrine.’ ‘I believe Mrs. Chillip perfectly right,’ said I. ‘Mrs. Chillip go far say,’ pursued meekest little men, much encouraged, ‘that people miscall religion, vent bad humours arrogance. And know I must say, sir,’ he continued, mildly laying his head one side, ‘that I DO NOT find authority Mr. Miss Murdstone New Testament?’ ‘I never found either!’ said I. ‘In meantime, sir,’ said Mr. Chillip, ‘they much disliked; free consigning everybody dislikes perdition, really good deal perdition going neighbourhood! However, Mrs. Chillip says, sir, undergo continual punishment; turned inward, feed upon hearts, hearts bad feeding. Now, sir, brain yours, you will excuse returning it. Do not expose good deal excitement, sir?’ I found difficult, excitement Mr. Chillip’s brain, his potations negus, divert his attention topic his affairs, which, next half-hour, he quite loquacious; giving understand, among pieces information, he Gray’s Inn Coffee-house lay his professional evidence Commission Lunacy, touching state mind patient become deranged excessive drinking. ‘And I assure you, sir,’ he said, ‘I extremely nervous occasions. I could support called Bullied, sir. It would quite unman me. Do know time I recovered conduct alarming lady, night birth, Mr. Copperfield?’ I told I going aunt, Dragon night, early morning; she one tender-hearted excellent women, he would know full well he knew her better. The mere notion possibility his ever seeing her again, appeared terrify him. He replied small pale smile, ‘Is she so, indeed, sir? Really?’ almost immediately called candle, went bed, he quite safe anywhere else. He actually stagger negus; I think his placid little pulse must made two three beats minute, done since great night aunt’s disappointment, she struck her bonnet. Thoroughly tired, I went bed too, midnight; passed next day Dover coach; burst safe sound aunt’s old parlour she tea (she wore spectacles now); received her, Mr. Dick, dear old Peggotty, acted housekeeper, open arms tears joy. My aunt mightily amused, began talk composedly, account meeting Mr. Chillip, his holding her dread remembrance; she Peggotty great deal say poor mother’s second husband, ‘that murdering woman sister’,--on I think pain penalty would induced aunt bestow Christian Proper Name, designation. CHAPTER 60. AGNES My aunt I, left alone, talked far night. How emigrants never wrote home, otherwise cheerfully hopefully; Mr. Micawber actually remitted divers small sums money, account ‘pecuniary liabilities’, reference he business-like man man; Janet, returning aunt’s service she came back Dover, finally carried her renunciation mankind entering wedlock thriving tavern-keeper; aunt finally set her seal great principle, aiding abetting bride, crowning marriage-ceremony her presence; among topics--already less familiar letters I had. Mr. Dick, usual, forgotten. My aunt informed he incessantly occupied copying everything he could lay his hands on, kept King Charles First respectful distance semblance employment; one main joys rewards her life he free happy, instead pining monotonous restraint; (as novel general conclusion) nobody she could ever fully know he was. ‘And when, Trot,’ said aunt, patting back hand, sat old way fire, ‘when going Canterbury?’ ‘I shall get horse, ride tomorrow morning, aunt, unless go me?’ ‘No!’ said aunt, her short abrupt way. ‘I mean stay I am.’ Then, I ride, I said. I could come Canterbury today without stopping, I coming anyone her. She pleased, answered, ‘Tut, Trot; MY old bones would kept till tomorrow!’ softly patted hand again, I sat looking thoughtfully fire. Thoughtfully, I could more, near Agnes, without revival regrets I long occupied. Softened regrets might be, teaching I failed learn younger life me, less regrets. ‘Oh, Trot,’ I seemed hear aunt say more; I understood her better now--‘Blind, blind, blind!’ We kept silence minutes. When I raised eyes, I found she steadily observant me. Perhaps she followed current mind; seemed easy one track now, wilful once. ‘You find her father white-haired old man,’ said aunt, ‘though better man respects--a reclaimed man. Neither find measuring human interests, joys, sorrows, his one poor little inch-rule now. Trust me, child, things must shrink much, measured way.’ ‘Indeed must,’ said I. ‘You find her,’ pursued aunt, ‘as good, beautiful, earnest, disinterested, she always been. If I knew higher praise, Trot, I would bestow her.’ There higher praise her; higher reproach me. Oh, I strayed far away! ‘If she trains young girls she her, like herself,’ said aunt, earnest even filling her eyes tears, ‘Heaven knows, her life well employed! Useful happy, she said day! How could she otherwise useful happy!’ ‘Has Agnes any--’ I thinking aloud, rather speaking. ‘Well? Hey? Any what?’ said aunt, sharply. ‘Any lover,’ said I. ‘A score,’ cried aunt, kind indignant pride. ‘She might married twenty times, dear, since gone!’ ‘No doubt,’ said I. ‘No doubt. But she lover worthy her? Agnes could care other.’ My aunt sat musing little while, her chin upon her hand. Slowly raising her eyes mine, she said: ‘I suspect she attachment, Trot.’ ‘A prosperous one?’ said I. ‘Trot,’ returned aunt gravely, ‘I cannot say. I right tell even much. She never confided me, I suspect it.’ She looked attentively anxiously (I even saw her tremble), I felt now, ever, she followed late thoughts. I summoned resolutions I made, many days nights, many conflicts heart. ‘If so,’ I began, ‘and I hope is-’ ‘I do not know is,’ said aunt curtly. ‘You must ruled suspicions. You must keep secret. They slight, perhaps. I right speak.’ ‘If so,’ I repeated, ‘Agnes tell her good time. A sister I confided much, aunt, reluctant confide me.’ My aunt withdrew her eyes mine, slowly she turned upon me; covered thoughtfully her hand. By she put her hand shoulder; sat, looking past, without saying another word, parted night. I rode away, early morning, scene old school-days. I cannot say I yet quite happy, hope I gaining victory myself; even prospect soon looking her face again. The well-remembered ground soon traversed, I came quiet streets, every stone boy’s book me. I went foot old house, went away heart full enter. I returned; looking, I passed, low window turret-room first Uriah Heep, afterwards Mr. Micawber, will not sit, saw little parlour now, office. Otherwise staid old house was, cleanliness order, still I first saw it. I requested new maid admitted me, tell Miss Wickfield gentleman waited her friend abroad, there; I shown grave old staircase (cautioned steps I knew well), unchanged drawing-room. The books Agnes I read together, shelves; desk I laboured lessons, many night, stood yet old corner table. All little changes crept Heeps there, changed again. Everything used be, happy time. I stood window, looked across ancient street opposite houses, recalling I watched wet afternoons, I first came there; I used speculate people appeared windows, followed eyes stairs, women went clicking along pavement pattens, dull rain fell slanting lines, poured water-spout yonder, flowed road. The feeling I used watch tramps, came town wet evenings, dusk, limped past, bundles drooping shoulders ends sticks, came freshly back me; fraught, then, smell damp earth, wet leaves briar, sensation airs blew upon toilsome journey. The opening little door panelled wall made start turn. Her beautiful serene eyes met mine she came towards me. She stopped laid her hand upon her bosom, I caught her arms. ‘Agnes! dear girl! I come suddenly upon you.’ ‘No, no! I rejoiced see you, Trotwood!’ ‘Dear Agnes, happiness me, see again!’ I folded her heart, and, little while, silent. Presently sat down, side side; her angel-face turned upon welcome I dreamed of, waking sleeping, whole years. She true, she beautiful, she good,--I owed her much gratitude, she dear me, I could find utterance I felt. I tried bless her, tried thank her, tried tell her (as I often done letters) influence she upon me; efforts vain. My love joy dumb. With her sweet tranquillity, she calmed agitation; led back time parting; spoke Emily, she visited, secret, many times; spoke tenderly Dora’s grave. With unerring instinct her noble heart, she touched chords memory softly harmoniously, one jarred within me; I could listen sorrowful, distant music, desire shrink nothing awoke. How could I, when, blended all, her dear self, better angel life? ‘And you, Agnes,’ I said, by. ‘Tell yourself. You hardly ever told life, lapse time!’ ‘What I tell?’ she answered, her radiant smile. ‘Papa well. You see us here, quiet home; anxieties set rest, home restored us; knowing that, dear Trotwood, know all.’ ‘All, Agnes?’ said I. She looked me, fluttering wonder her face. ‘Is nothing else, Sister?’ I said. Her colour, faded, returned, faded again. She smiled; quiet sadness, I thought; shook her head. I sought lead her aunt hinted at; for, sharply painful must receive confidence, I discipline heart, duty her. I saw, however, she uneasy, I let pass. ‘You much do, dear Agnes?’ ‘With school?’ said she, looking again, her bright composure. ‘Yes. It laborious, not?’ ‘The labour pleasant,’ she returned, ‘that scarcely grateful call name.’ ‘Nothing good difficult you,’ said I. Her colour came went more; more, she bent her head, I saw sad smile. ‘You wait see papa,’ said Agnes, cheerfully, ‘and pass day us? Perhaps sleep room? We always call yours.’ I could that, promised ride back aunt’s night; I would pass day there, joyfully. ‘I must prisoner little while,’ said Agnes, ‘but old books, Trotwood, old music.’ ‘Even old flowers here,’ said I, looking round; ‘or old kinds.’ ‘I found pleasure,’ returned Agnes, smiling, ‘while absent, keeping everything used children. For happy then, I think.’ ‘Heaven knows were!’ said I. ‘And every little thing reminded brother,’ said Agnes, her cordial eyes turned cheerfully upon me, ‘has welcome companion. Even this,’ showing basket-trifle, full keys, still hanging her side, ‘seems jingle kind old tune!’ She smiled again, went door she come. It guard sisterly affection religious care. It I left myself, treasure. If I shook foundations sacred confidence usage, virtue given me, lost, could never recovered. I set steadily myself. The better I loved her, behoved never forget it. I walked streets; and, seeing old adversary butcher--now constable, his staff hanging shop--went look place I fought him; meditated Miss Shepherd eldest Miss Larkins, idle loves likings, dislikings, time. Nothing seemed survived time Agnes; she, ever star me, brighter higher. When I returned, Mr. Wickfield come home, garden he had, couple miles town, he employed almost every day. I found aunt described him. We sat dinner, half-dozen little girls; he seemed shadow his handsome picture wall. The tranquillity peace belonging, old, quiet ground memory, pervaded again. When dinner done, Mr. Wickfield taking wine, I desiring none, went up-stairs; Agnes her little charges sang played, worked. After tea children left us; three sat together, talking bygone days. ‘My part them,’ said Mr. Wickfield, shaking his white head, ‘has much matter regret--for deep regret, deep contrition, Trotwood, well know. But I would cancel it, power.’ I could readily believe that, looking face beside him. ‘I cancel it,’ he pursued, ‘such patience devotion, fidelity, child’s love, I must forget, no! even forget myself.’ ‘I understand you, sir,’ I softly said. ‘I hold it--I always held it--in veneration.’ ‘But one knows, even you,’ he returned, ‘how much she done, much she undergone, hard she striven. Dear Agnes!’ She put her hand entreatingly his arm, stop him; very, pale. ‘Well, well!’ he said sigh, dismissing, I saw, trial she borne, yet bear, connexion aunt told me. ‘Well! I never told you, Trotwood, her mother. Has anyone?’ ‘Never, sir.’ ‘It is much--though much suffer. She married opposition her father’s wish, he renounced her. She prayed forgive her, Agnes came world. He hard man, her mother long dead. He repulsed her. He broke her heart.’ Agnes leaned upon his shoulder, stole her arm his neck. ‘She affectionate gentle heart,’ he said; ‘and broken. I knew tender nature well. No one could, I not. She loved dearly, never happy. She always labouring, secret, distress; delicate downcast time his last repulse--for first, many--pined away died. She left Agnes, two weeks old; grey hair recollect with, first came.’ He kissed Agnes her cheek. ‘My love dear child diseased love, mind unhealthy then. I say that. I speaking myself, Trotwood, her mother, her. If I give clue I am, I been, unravel it, I know. What Agnes is, I need say. I always read something her poor mother’s story, her character; I tell tonight, three together, great changes. I told all.’ His bowed head, her angel-face filial duty, derived pathetic meaning before. If I wanted anything mark night re-union, I found this. Agnes rose her father’s side, long; going softly her piano, played old airs often listened place. ‘Have intention going away again?’ Agnes asked me, I standing by. ‘What sister say that?’ ‘I hope not.’ ‘Then I intention, Agnes.’ ‘I think ought not, Trotwood, since ask me,’ she said, mildly. ‘Your growing reputation success enlarge power good; I could spare brother,’ her eyes upon me, ‘perhaps time could not.’ ‘What I am, made me, Agnes. You know best.’ ‘I made you, Trotwood?’ ‘Yes! Agnes, dear girl!’ I said, bending her. ‘I tried tell you, met today, something thoughts since Dora died. You remember, came little room--pointing upward, Agnes?’ ‘Oh, Trotwood!’ she returned, her eyes filled tears. ‘So loving, confiding, young! Can I ever forget?’ ‘As then, sister, I often thought since, ever me. Ever pointing upward, Agnes; ever leading something better; ever directing higher things!’ She shook her head; her tears I saw sad quiet smile. ‘And I grateful it, Agnes, bound you, name affection heart. I want know, yet do not know tell you, life long I shall look you, guided you, I darkness past. Whatever betides, whatever new ties may form, whatever changes may come us, I shall always look you, love you, I now, always done. You always solace resource, always been. Until I die, dearest sister, I shall see always me, pointing upward!’ She put her hand mine, told she proud me, I said; although I praised her far beyond her worth. Then she went softly playing, without removing her eyes me. ‘Do know, I heard tonight, Agnes,’ said I, strangely seems part feeling I regarded I saw first--with I sat beside rough school-days?’ ‘You knew I mother,’ she replied smile, ‘and felt kindly towards me.’ ‘More that, Agnes, I knew, almost I known story, something inexplicably gentle softened, surrounding you; something might sorrowful someone else (as I understand was), you.’ She softly played on, looking still. ‘Will laugh cherishing fancies, Agnes?’ ‘No!’ ‘Or saying I really believe I felt, even then, could faithfully affectionate discouragement, never cease so, ceased live?---Will laugh dream?’ ‘Oh, no! Oh, no!’ For instant, distressful shadow crossed her face; but, even start gave me, gone; she playing on, looking her calm smile. As I rode back lonely night, wind going like restless memory, I thought this, feared she happy. I happy; but, thus far, I faithfully set seal upon Past, and, thinking her, pointing upward, thought her pointing sky me, where, mystery come, I might yet love her love unknown earth, tell her strife within I loved her here. CHAPTER 61. I AM SHOWN TWO INTERESTING PENITENTS For time--at events book completed, would work several months--I took abode aunt’s house Dover; there, sitting window I looked moon upon sea, roof first gave shelter, I quietly pursued task. In pursuance intention referring fictions course incidentally connect progress story, I enter aspirations, delights, anxieties, triumphs art. That I truly devoted strongest earnestness, bestowed upon every energy soul, I already said. If books I written worth, supply rest. I shall otherwise written poor purpose, rest interest one. Occasionally, I went London; lose swarm life there, consult Traddles business point. He managed me, absence, soundest judgement; worldly affairs prospering. As notoriety began bring upon enormous quantity letters people I knowledge--chiefly nothing, extremely difficult answer--I agreed Traddles name painted his door. There, devoted postman beat delivered bushels letters me; there, intervals, I laboured them, like Home Secretary State without salary. Among correspondence, dropped in, every then, obliging proposal one numerous outsiders always lurking Commons, practise cover name (if I would take necessary steps remaining make proctor myself), pay percentage profits. But I declined offers; already aware plenty covert practitioners existence, considering Commons quite bad enough, without anything make worse. The girls gone home, name burst bloom Traddles’s door; sharp boy looked, day, he never heard Sophy, shut back room, glancing her work sooty little strip garden pump it. But I always found her, bright housewife; often humming her Devonshire ballads strange foot coming stairs, blunting sharp boy his official closet melody. I wondered, first, I often found Sophy writing copy-book; she always shut I appeared, hurried table-drawer. But secret soon came out. One day, Traddles (who come home drizzling sleet Court) took paper his desk, asked I thought handwriting? ‘Oh, DO NOT, Tom!’ cried Sophy, warming his slippers fire. ‘My dear,’ returned Tom, delighted state, ‘why not? What say writing, Copperfield?’ ‘It is extraordinarily legal formal,’ said I. ‘I do not think I ever saw stiff hand.’ ‘Not like lady’s hand, it?’ said Traddles. ‘A lady’s!’ I repeated. ‘Bricks mortar like lady’s hand!’ Traddles broke rapturous laugh, informed Sophy’s writing; Sophy vowed declared he would need copying-clerk soon, she would clerk; she acquired hand pattern; she could throw off--I forget many folios hour. Sophy much confused told this, said ‘Tom’ made judge he would not ready proclaim it. Which ‘Tom’ denied; averring he always equally proud it, circumstances. ‘What thoroughly good charming wife she is, dear Traddles!’ said I, she gone away, laughing. ‘My dear Copperfield,’ returned Traddles, ‘she is, without exception, dearest girl! The way she manages place; her punctuality, domestic knowledge, economy, order; her cheerfulness, Copperfield!’ ‘Indeed, reason commend her!’ I returned. ‘You happy fellow. I believe make yourselves, other, two happiest people world.’ ‘I sure ARE two happiest people,’ returned Traddles. ‘I admit that, events. Bless soul, I see her getting candle-light dark mornings, busying herself day’s arrangements, going market clerks come Inn, caring weather, devising capital little dinners plainest materials, making puddings pies, keeping everything right place, always neat ornamental herself, sitting night it is ever late, sweet-tempered encouraging always, me, I positively sometimes cannot believe it, Copperfield!’ He tender slippers she warming, he put on, stretched his feet enjoyingly upon fender. ‘I positively sometimes cannot believe it,’ said Traddles. ‘Then pleasures! Dear me, inexpensive, quite wonderful! When home here, evening, shut outer door, draw curtains--which she made--where could snug? When it is fine, go walk evening, streets abound enjoyment us. We look glittering windows jewellers’ shops; I show Sophy diamond-eyed serpents, coiled white satin rising grounds, I would give her I could afford it; Sophy shows gold watches capped jewelled engine-turned, possessed horizontal lever-escape-movement, sorts things, she would buy she could afford it; pick spoons forks, fish-slices, butter-knives, sugar-tongs, prefer could afford it; really go away got them! Then, stroll squares, great streets, see house let, sometimes look it, say, would THAT do, I made judge? And parcel out--such room us, rooms girls, forth; settle satisfaction would do, would not do, case may be. Sometimes, go half-price pit theatre--the smell cheap, opinion, money--and thoroughly enjoy play: Sophy believes every word of, I. In walking home, perhaps buy little bit something cook’s-shop, little lobster fishmongers, bring here, make splendid supper, chatting seen. Now, know, Copperfield, I Lord Chancellor, could not this!’ ‘You would something, whatever were, dear Traddles,’ thought I, ‘that would pleasant amiable. And way,’ I said aloud, ‘I suppose never draw skeletons now?’ ‘Really,’ replied Traddles, laughing, reddening, ‘I cannot wholly deny I do, dear Copperfield. For one back rows King’s Bench day, pen hand, fancy came head try I preserved accomplishment. And I afraid there is skeleton--in wig--on ledge desk.’ After laughed heartily, Traddles wound looking smile fire, saying, his forgiving way, ‘Old Creakle!’ ‘I letter old--Rascal here,’ said I. For I never less disposed forgive way he used batter Traddles, I saw Traddles ready forgive himself. ‘From Creakle schoolmaster?’ exclaimed Traddles. ‘No!’ ‘Among persons attracted rising fame fortune,’ said I, looking letters, ‘and discover always much attached me, self-same Creakle. He schoolmaster now, Traddles. He retired. He Middlesex Magistrate.’ I thought Traddles might surprised hear it, he all. ‘How suppose he comes Middlesex Magistrate?’ said I. ‘Oh dear me!’ replied Traddles, ‘it would difficult answer question. Perhaps he voted somebody, lent money somebody, bought something somebody, otherwise obliged somebody, jobbed somebody, knew somebody got lieutenant county nominate commission.’ ‘On commission he is, rate,’ said I. ‘And he writes here, he glad show me, operation, true system prison discipline; unchallengeable way making sincere lasting converts penitents--which, know, solitary confinement. What say?’ ‘To system?’ inquired Traddles, looking grave. ‘No. To accepting offer, going me?’ ‘I do not object,’ said Traddles. ‘Then I will write say so. You remember (to say nothing treatment) Creakle turning his son doors, I suppose, life he used lead his wife daughter?’ ‘Perfectly,’ said Traddles. ‘Yet, you will read his letter, you will find he tenderest men prisoners convicted whole calendar felonies,’ said I; ‘though I cannot find his tenderness extends class created beings.’ Traddles shrugged his shoulders, surprised. I expected be, surprised myself; observation similar practical satires would scanty. We arranged time visit, I wrote accordingly Mr. Creakle evening. On appointed day--I think next day, matter--Traddles I repaired prison Mr. Creakle powerful. It immense solid building, erected vast expense. I could help thinking, approached gate, uproar would made country, deluded man proposed spend one half money cost, erection industrial school young, house refuge deserving old. In office might ground-floor Tower Babel, massively constructed, presented old schoolmaster; one group, composed two three busier sort magistrates, visitors brought. He received me, like man formed mind bygone years, always loved tenderly. On introducing Traddles, Mr. Creakle expressed, like manner, inferior degree, he always Traddles’s guide, philosopher, friend. Our venerable instructor great deal older, improved appearance. His face fiery ever; his eyes small, rather deeper set. The scanty, wet-looking grey hair, I remembered him, almost gone; thick veins his bald head none agreeable look at. After conversation among gentlemen, I might supposed nothing world legitimately taken account supreme comfort prisoners, expense, nothing wide earth done outside prison-doors, began inspection. It dinner-time, went, first great kitchen, every prisoner’s dinner course set separately (to handed his cell), regularity precision clock-work. I said aside, Traddles, I wondered whether occurred anybody, striking contrast plentiful repasts choice quality, dinners, say paupers, soldiers, sailors, labourers, great bulk honest, working community; one man five hundred ever dined half well. But I learned ‘system’ required high living; and, short, dispose system, all, I found head others, ‘the system’ put end doubts, disposed anomalies. Nobody appeared least idea system, THE system, considered. As going magnificent passages, I inquired Mr. Creakle his friends supposed main advantages all-governing universally over-riding system? I found perfect isolation prisoners--so one man confinement there, knew anything another; reduction prisoners wholesome state mind, leading sincere contrition repentance. Now, struck me, began visit individuals cells, traverse passages cells were, manner going chapel forth, explained us, strong probability prisoners knowing good deal other, carrying pretty complete system intercourse. This, time I write, proved, I believe, case; but, would flat blasphemy system hinted doubt then, I looked penitence diligently I could. And again, I great misgivings. I found prevalent fashion form penitence, I left outside forms coats waistcoats windows tailors’ shops. I found vast amount profession, varying little character: varying little (which I thought exceedingly suspicious), even words. I found great many foxes, disparaging whole vineyards inaccessible grapes; I found foxes I would trusted within reach bunch. Above all, I found professing men greatest objects interest; conceit, vanity, want excitement, love deception (which many possessed almost incredible extent, histories showed), prompted professions, gratified them. However, I heard repeatedly, course goings fro, certain Number Twenty Seven, Favourite, really appeared Model Prisoner, I resolved suspend judgement I see Twenty Seven. Twenty Eight, I understood, also bright particular star; his misfortune his glory little dimmed extraordinary lustre Twenty Seven. I heard much Twenty Seven, his pious admonitions everybody around him, beautiful letters he constantly wrote his mother (whom he seemed consider bad way), I became quite impatient see him. I restrain impatience time, account Twenty Seven reserved concluding effect. But, last, came door his cell; Mr. Creakle, looking little hole it, reported us, state greatest admiration, he reading Hymn Book. There rush heads immediately, see Number Twenty Seven reading his Hymn Book, little hole blocked up, six seven heads deep. To remedy inconvenience, give us opportunity conversing Twenty Seven his purity, Mr. Creakle directed door cell unlocked, Twenty Seven invited passage. This done; Traddles I behold, amazement, converted Number Twenty Seven, Uriah Heep! He knew us directly; said, he came out--with old writhe,-- ‘How do, Mr. Copperfield? How do, Mr. Traddles?’ This recognition caused general admiration party. I rather thought everyone struck his proud, taking notice us. ‘Well, Twenty Seven,’ said Mr. Creakle, mournfully admiring him. ‘How find today?’ ‘I umble, sir!’ replied Uriah Heep. ‘You always so, Twenty Seven,’ said Mr. Creakle. Here, another gentleman asked, extreme anxiety: ‘Are quite comfortable?’ ‘Yes, I thank you, sir!’ said Uriah Heep, looking direction. ‘Far comfortable here, ever I outside. I see follies, now, sir. That is makes comfortable.’ Several gentlemen much affected; third questioner, forcing front, inquired extreme feeling: ‘How find beef?’ ‘Thank you, sir,’ replied Uriah, glancing new direction voice, ‘it tougher yesterday I could wish; it is duty bear. I committed follies, gentlemen,’ said Uriah, looking round meek smile, ‘and I ought bear consequences without repining.’ A murmur, partly gratification Twenty Seven’s celestial state mind, partly indignation Contractor given complaint (a note immediately made Mr. Creakle), subsided, Twenty Seven stood midst us, he felt principal object merit highly meritorious museum. That we, neophytes, might excess light shining upon us once, orders given let Twenty Eight. I much astonished already, I felt kind resigned wonder Mr. Littimer walked forth, reading good book! ‘Twenty Eight,’ said gentleman spectacles, yet spoken, ‘you complained last week, good fellow, cocoa. How since?’ ‘I thank you, sir,’ said Mr. Littimer, ‘it better made. If I might take liberty saying so, sir, I do not think milk boiled quite genuine; I aware, sir, great adulteration milk, London, article pure state difficult obtained.’ It appeared gentleman spectacles backed his Twenty Eight Mr. Creakle’s Twenty Seven, took his man hand. ‘What state mind, Twenty Eight?’ said questioner spectacles. ‘I thank you, sir,’ returned Mr. Littimer; ‘I see follies now, sir. I good deal troubled I think sins former companions, sir; I trust may find forgiveness.’ ‘You quite happy yourself?’ said questioner, nodding encouragement. ‘I much obliged you, sir,’ returned Mr. Littimer. ‘Perfectly so.’ ‘Is anything mind now?’ said questioner. ‘If so, mention it, Twenty Eight.’ ‘Sir,’ said Mr. Littimer, without looking up, ‘if eyes deceived me, gentleman present acquainted former life. It may profitable gentleman know, sir, I attribute past follies, entirely lived thoughtless life service young men; allowed led weaknesses, I strength resist. I hope gentleman take warning, sir, offended freedom. It his good. I conscious past follies. I hope he may repent wickedness sin he party.’ I observed several gentlemen shading eyes, one hand, come church. ‘This credit, Twenty Eight,’ returned questioner. ‘I expected you. Is anything else?’ ‘Sir,’ returned Mr. Littimer, slightly lifting his eyebrows, his eyes, ‘there young woman fell dissolute courses, I endeavoured save, sir, could rescue. I beg gentleman, he his power, inform young woman I forgive her her bad conduct towards myself, I call her repentance--if he good.’ ‘I doubt, Twenty Eight,’ returned questioner, ‘that gentleman refer feels strongly--as must--what properly said. We detain you.’ ‘I thank you, sir,’ said Mr. Littimer. ‘Gentlemen, I wish good day, hoping families also see wickedness, amend!’ With this, Number Twenty Eight retired, glance Uriah; altogether unknown other, medium communication; murmur went round group, his door shut upon him, he respectable man, beautiful case. ‘Now, Twenty Seven,’ said Mr. Creakle, entering clear stage his man, ‘is anything anyone you? If so, mention it.’ ‘I would umbly ask, sir,’ returned Uriah, jerk his malevolent head, ‘for leave write mother.’ ‘It shall certainly granted,’ said Mr. Creakle. ‘Thank you, sir! I anxious mother. I afraid she are not safe.’ Somebody incautiously asked, from? But scandalized whisper ‘Hush!’ ‘Immortally safe, sir,’ returned Uriah, writhing direction voice. ‘I wish mother got state. I never got present state I had not come here. I wish mother come here. It would better everybody, got took up, brought here.’ This sentiment gave unbounded satisfaction--greater satisfaction, I think, anything passed yet. ‘Before I come here,’ said Uriah, stealing look us, he would blighted outer world belonged, he could, ‘I given follies; I sensible follies. There is deal sin outside. There is deal sin mother. There is nothing sin everywhere--except here.’ ‘You quite changed?’ said Mr. Creakle. ‘Oh dear, yes, sir!’ cried hopeful penitent. ‘You would not relapse, going out?’ asked somebody else. ‘Oh de-ar no, sir!’ ‘Well!’ said Mr. Creakle, ‘this gratifying. You addressed Mr. Copperfield, Twenty Seven. Do wish say anything him?’ ‘You knew me, long time I came changed, Mr. Copperfield,’ said Uriah, looking me; villainous look I never saw, even his visage. ‘You knew when, spite follies, I umble among proud, meek among violent--you violent yourself, Mr. Copperfield. Once, struck blow face, know.’ General commiseration. Several indignant glances directed me. ‘But I forgive you, Mr. Copperfield,’ said Uriah, making his forgiving nature subject impious awful parallel, I shall record. ‘I forgive everybody. It would ill become bear malice. I freely forgive you, I hope you will curb passions future. I hope Mr. W. repent, Miss W., sinful lot. You have visited affliction, I hope may good; you would better come here. Mr. W. better come here, Miss W. too. The best wish I could give you, Mr. Copperfield, give gentlemen, is, could took brought here. When I think past follies, present state, I sure would best you. I pity are not brought here!’ He sneaked back his cell, amidst little chorus approbation; Traddles I experienced great relief he locked in. It characteristic feature repentance, I fain ask two men done, all. That appeared last thing anything say. I addressed one two warders, who, I suspected certain latent indications faces, knew pretty well stir worth. ‘Do know,’ said I, walked along passage, ‘what felony Number Twenty Seven’s last “folly”?’ The answer Bank case. ‘A fraud Bank England?’ I asked. ‘Yes, sir. Fraud, forgery, conspiracy. He others. He set others on. It deep plot large sum. Sentence, transportation life. Twenty Seven knowingest bird lot, nearly kept safe; quite. The Bank able put salt upon his tail--and just.’ ‘Do know Twenty Eight’s offence?’ ‘Twenty Eight,’ returned informant, speaking throughout low tone, looking his shoulder walked along passage, guard overheard, unlawful reference Immaculates, Creakle rest; ‘Twenty Eight (also transportation) got place, robbed young master matter two hundred fifty pounds money valuables, night going abroad. I particularly recollect his case, his took dwarf.’ ‘A what?’ ‘A little woman. I forgot her name?’ ‘Not Mowcher?’ ‘That is it! He eluded pursuit, going America flaxen wig, whiskers, complete disguise never see born days; little woman, Southampton, met walking along street--picked her sharp eye moment--ran betwixt his legs upset him--and held like grim Death.’ ‘Excellent Miss Mowcher!’ cried I. ‘You would said so, seen her, standing chair witness-box trial, I did,’ said friend. ‘He cut her face right open, pounded her brutal manner, she took him; she never loosed her hold till he locked up. She held tight him, fact, officers obliged take ‘them together. She gave her evidence gamest way, highly complimented Bench, cheered right home her lodgings. She said Court she would took single-handed (on account she knew concerning him), he Samson. And it is belief she would!’ It mine too, I highly respected Miss Mowcher it. We seen see. It would vain represent man Worshipful Mr. Creakle, Twenty Seven Twenty Eight perfectly consistent unchanged; exactly then, always been; hypocritical knaves subjects make sort profession place; knew market-value least well did, immediate service would expatriated; word, rotten, hollow, painfully suggestive piece business altogether. We left system themselves, went home wondering. ‘Perhaps it is good thing, Traddles,’ said I, ‘to unsound Hobby ridden hard; it is sooner ridden death.’ ‘I hope so,’ replied Traddles. CHAPTER 62. A LIGHT SHINES ON MY WAY The year came round Christmas-time, I home two months. I seen Agnes frequently. However loud general voice might giving encouragement, however fervent emotions endeavours roused me, I heard her lightest word praise I heard nothing else. At least week, sometimes oftener, I rode there, passed evening. I usually rode back night; old unhappy sense always hovering now--most sorrowfully I left her--and I glad out, rather wandering past weary wakefulness miserable dreams. I wore away longest part many wild sad nights, rides; reviving, I went, thoughts occupied long absence. Or, I say rather I listened echoes thoughts, I better express truth. They spoke afar off. I put distance, accepted inevitable place. When I read Agnes I wrote; I saw her listening face; moved her smiles tears; heard her cordial voice earnest shadowy events imaginative world I lived; I thought fate mine might been--but thought so, I thought I married Dora, I could wished wife be. My duty Agnes, loved love, which, I disquieted, I wronged selfishly poorly, could never restore; matured assurance I, worked destiny, I impetuously set heart on, right murmur, must bear; comprised I felt I learned. But I loved her: even became consolation me, vaguely conceive distant day I might blamelessly avow it; over; I could say ‘Agnes, I came home; I old, I never loved since!’ She show change herself. What she always me, she still was; wholly unaltered. Between aunt something, connexion, since night return, I cannot call restraint, avoidance subject, much implied understanding thought together, shape thoughts words. When, according old custom, sat fire night, often fell train; naturally, consciously other, unreservedly said so. But preserved unbroken silence. I believed she read, partly read, thoughts night; she fully comprehended I gave mine distinct expression. This Christmas-time come, Agnes reposed new confidence me, doubt several times arisen mind--whether she could perception true state breast, restrained her apprehension giving pain--began oppress heavily. If so, sacrifice nothing; plainest obligation her unfulfilled; every poor action I shrunk from, I hourly doing. I resolved set right beyond doubt;--if barrier us, break determined hand. It was--what lasting reason I remember it!--a cold, harsh, winter day. There snow, hours before; lay, deep, hard-frozen ground. Out sea, beyond window, wind blew ruggedly north. I thinking it, sweeping mountain wastes snow Switzerland, inaccessible human foot; speculating lonelier, solitary regions, deserted ocean. ‘Riding today, Trot?’ said aunt, putting her head door. ‘Yes,’ said I, ‘I going Canterbury. It is good day ride.’ ‘I hope horse may think too,’ said aunt; ‘but present he holding his head his ears, standing door there, he thought his stable preferable.’ My aunt, I may observe, allowed horse forbidden ground, relented towards donkeys. ‘He fresh enough, presently!’ said I. ‘The ride his master good, events,’ observed aunt, glancing papers table. ‘Ah, child, pass good many hours here! I never thought, I used read books, work write them.’ ‘It is work enough read them, sometimes,’ I returned. ‘As writing, charms, aunt.’ ‘Ah! I see!’ said aunt. ‘Ambition, love approbation, sympathy, much more, I suppose? Well: go along you!’ ‘Do know anything more,’ said I, standing composedly her--she patted shoulder, sat chair--‘of attachment Agnes?’ She looked face little while, replying: ‘I think I do, Trot.’ ‘Are confirmed impression?’ I inquired. ‘I think I am, Trot.’ She looked steadfastly me: kind doubt, pity, suspense her affection: I summoned stronger determination show her perfectly cheerful face. ‘And more, Trot--’ said aunt. ‘Yes!’ ‘I think Agnes going married.’ ‘God bless her!’ said I, cheerfully. ‘God bless her!’ said aunt, ‘and her husband too!’ I echoed it, parted aunt, went lightly downstairs, mounted, rode away. There greater reason I resolved do. How well I recollect wintry ride! The frozen particles ice, brushed blades grass wind, borne across face; hard clatter horse’s hoofs, beating tune upon ground; stiff-tilled soil; snowdrift, lightly eddying chalk-pit breeze ruffled it; smoking team waggon old hay, stopping breathe hill-top, shaking bells musically; whitened slopes sweeps Down-land lying dark sky, drawn huge slate! I found Agnes alone. The little girls gone homes now, she alone fire, reading. She put her book seeing come in; welcomed usual, took her work-basket sat one old-fashioned windows. I sat beside her window-seat, talked I doing, would done, progress I made since last visit. Agnes cheerful; laughingly predicted I soon become famous talked to, subjects. ‘So I make present time, see,’ said Agnes, ‘and talk I may.’ As I looked her beautiful face, observant her work, she raised her mild clear eyes, saw I looking her. ‘You thoughtful today, Trotwood!’ ‘Agnes, shall I tell about? I came tell you.’ She put aside her work, she used seriously discussing anything; gave her whole attention. ‘My dear Agnes, doubt true you?’ ‘No!’ she answered, look astonishment. ‘Do doubt I always you?’ ‘No!’ she answered, before. ‘Do remember I tried tell you, I came home, debt gratitude I owed you, dearest Agnes, fervently I felt towards you?’ ‘I remember it,’ she said, gently, ‘very well.’ ‘You secret,’ said I. ‘Let share it, Agnes.’ She cast her eyes, trembled. ‘I could hardly fail know, even I heard--but lips yours, Agnes, seems strange--that someone upon bestowed treasure love. Do shut concerns happiness nearly! If trust me, say can, I know may, let friend, brother, matter, others!’ With appealing, almost reproachful, glance, she rose window; hurrying across room without knowing where, put her hands her face, burst tears smote heart. And yet awakened something me, bringing promise heart. Without knowing why, tears allied quietly sad smile fixed remembrance, shook hope fear sorrow. ‘Agnes! Sister! Dearest! What I done?’ ‘Let go away, Trotwood. I well. I myself. I speak by--another time. I write you. Do not speak now. Do not! do not!’ I sought recollect she said, I spoken her former night, her affection needing return. It seemed world I must search moment. ‘Agnes, I cannot bear see so, think I because. My dearest girl, dearer anything life, unhappy, let share unhappiness. If need help counsel, let try give you. If indeed burden heart, let try lighten it. For I live now, Agnes, you!’ ‘Oh, spare me! I myself! Another time!’ I could distinguish. Was selfish error leading away? Or, clue hope, something opening I dared think of? ‘I must say more. I cannot let leave so! For Heaven’s sake, Agnes, let us mistake years, come gone them! I must speak plainly. If lingering thought I could envy happiness confer; I could resign dearer protector, choosing; I could not, removed place, contented witness joy; dismiss it, I do not deserve it! I suffered quite vain. You taught quite vain. There alloy self I feel you.’ She quiet now. In little time, she turned her pale face towards me, said low voice, broken there, clear: ‘I owe pure friendship me, Trotwood--which, indeed, I doubt--to tell you, mistaken. I more. If I sometimes, course years, wanted help counsel, come me. If I sometimes unhappy, feeling passed away. If I ever burden heart, lightened me. If I secret, is--no new one; is--not suppose. I cannot reveal it, divide it. It long mine, must remain mine.’ ‘Agnes! Stay! A moment!’ She going away, I detained her. I clasped arm her waist. ‘In course years!’ ‘It new one!’ New thoughts hopes whirling mind, colours life changing. ‘Dearest Agnes! Whom I respect honour--whom I devotedly love! When I came today, I thought nothing could wrested confession me. I thought I could kept bosom lives, till old. But, Agnes, I indeed new-born hope I may ever call something Sister, widely different Sister!--’ Her tears fell fast; like she lately she would, I saw hope brighten them. ‘Agnes! Ever guide, best support! If mindful yourself, less me, grew together, I think heedless fancy never would wandered you. But much better I, necessary every boyish hope disappointment, confide in, rely upon everything, became second nature, supplanting time first greater one loving I do!’ Still weeping, sadly--joyfully! And clasped arms she never been, I thought she never be! ‘When I loved Dora--fondly, Agnes, know--’ ‘Yes!’ she cried, earnestly. ‘I glad know it!’ ‘When I loved her--even then, love would incomplete, without sympathy. I it, perfected. And I lost her, Agnes, I without you, still!’ Closer arms, nearer heart, her trembling hand upon shoulder, her sweet eyes shining her tears, mine! ‘I went away, dear Agnes, loving you. I stayed away, loving you. I returned home, loving you!’ And now, I tried tell her struggle I had, conclusion I come to. I tried lay mind her, truly, entirely. I tried show her I hoped I come better knowledge her; I resigned better knowledge brought; I come there, even day, fidelity this. If she love (I said) she could take her husband, she could so, deserving mine, except upon truth love her, trouble ripened was; hence I revealed it. And O, Agnes, even thy true eyes, time, spirit child-wife looked upon me, saying well; winning me, thee, tenderest recollections Blossom withered bloom! ‘I blest, Trotwood--my heart overcharged--but one thing I must say.’ ‘Dearest, what?’ She laid her gentle hands upon shoulders, looked calmly face. ‘Do know, yet, is?’ ‘I afraid speculate is. Tell me, dear.’ ‘I loved life!’ O, happy, happy! Our tears trials (hers much greater) come thus, rapture thus, never divided more! We walked, winter evening, fields together; blessed calm within us seemed partaken frosty air. The early stars began shine lingering on, looking them, thanked GOD guided us tranquillity. We stood together old-fashioned window night, moon shining; Agnes her quiet eyes raised it; I following her glance. Long miles road opened mind; and, toiling on, I saw ragged way-worn boy, forsaken neglected, come call even heart beating mine, his own. It nearly dinner-time next day appeared aunt. She study, Peggotty said: her pride keep readiness order me. We found her, her spectacles, sitting fire. ‘Goodness me!’ said aunt, peering dusk, ‘who is you are bringing home?’ ‘Agnes,’ said I. As arranged say nothing first, aunt little discomfited. She darted hopeful glance me, I said ‘Agnes’; seeing I looked usual, she took her spectacles despair, rubbed her nose them. She greeted Agnes heartily, nevertheless; soon lighted parlour downstairs, dinner. My aunt put her spectacles twice thrice, take another look me, often took again, disappointed, rubbed her nose them. Much discomfiture Mr. Dick, knew bad symptom. ‘By by, aunt,’ said I, dinner; ‘I speaking Agnes told me.’ ‘Then, Trot,’ said aunt, turning scarlet, ‘you wrong, broke promise.’ ‘You angry, aunt, I trust? I sure will not be, learn Agnes unhappy attachment.’ ‘Stuff nonsense!’ said aunt. As aunt appeared annoyed, I thought best way cut her annoyance short. I took Agnes arm back her chair, leaned her. My aunt, one clap her hands, one look her spectacles, immediately went hysterics, first time knowledge her. The hysterics called Peggotty. The moment aunt restored, she flew Peggotty, calling her silly old creature, hugged her her might. After that, she hugged Mr. Dick (who highly honoured, good deal surprised); that, told why. Then, happy together. I could discover whether aunt, her last short conversation me, fallen pious fraud, really mistaken state mind. It quite enough, she said, she told Agnes going married; I knew better anyone true was. We married within fortnight. Traddles Sophy, Doctor Mrs. Strong, guests quiet wedding. We left full joy; drove away together. Clasped embrace, I held source every worthy aspiration I ever had; centre myself, circle life, own, wife; love founded rock! ‘Dearest husband!’ said Agnes. ‘Now I may call name, I one thing tell you.’ ‘Let hear it, love.’ ‘It grows night Dora died. She sent me.’ ‘She did.’ ‘She told she left something. Can think was?’ I believed I could. I drew wife long loved me, closer side. ‘She told she made last request me, left last charge.’ ‘And was--’ ‘That I would occupy vacant place.’ And Agnes laid her head upon breast, wept; I wept her, though happy. CHAPTER 63. A VISITOR What I purposed record nearly finished; yet incident conspicuous memory, often rests delight, without one thread web I spun would ravelled end. I advanced fame fortune, domestic joy perfect, I married ten happy years. Agnes I sitting fire, house London, one night spring, three children playing room, I told stranger wished see me. He asked he came business, answered No; he come pleasure seeing me, come long way. He old man, servant said, looked like farmer. As sounded mysterious children, moreover like beginning favourite story Agnes used tell them, introductory arrival wicked old Fairy cloak hated everybody, produced commotion. One boys laid his head his mother’s lap harm’s way, little Agnes (our eldest child) left her doll chair represent her, thrust her little heap golden curls window-curtains, see happened next. ‘Let come here!’ said I. There soon appeared, pausing dark doorway he entered, hale, grey-haired old man. Little Agnes, attracted his looks, run bring in, I yet clearly seen his face, wife, starting up, cried me, pleased agitated voice, Mr. Peggotty! It WAS Mr. Peggotty. An old man now, ruddy, hearty, strong old age. When first emotion over, he sat fire children his knees, blaze shining his face, he looked, me, vigorous robust, withal handsome, old man, ever I seen. ‘Mas’r Davy,’ said he. And old name old tone fell naturally ear! ‘Mas’r Davy, ‘it is joyful hour I see you, more, ‘long trew wife!’ ‘A joyful hour indeed, old friend!’ cried I. ‘And heer pretty ones,’ said Mr. Peggotty. ‘To look heer flowers! Why, Mas’r Davy, heighth littlest these, I first see you! When Them’ly warn’t bigger, poor lad BUT lad!’ ‘Time changed changed since then,’ said I. ‘But let dear rogues go bed; house England must hold you, tell send luggage (is old black bag among it, went far, I wonder!), then, glass Yarmouth grog, tidings ten years!’ ‘Are alone?’ asked Agnes. ‘Yes, madam,’ he said, kissing her hand, ‘quite alone.’ We sat us, knowing give welcome enough; I began listen his old familiar voice, I could fancied he still pursuing his long journey search his darling niece. ‘It is mort water,’ said Mr. Peggotty, ‘fur come across, on’y stay matter fower weeks. But water [‘specially ‘it is salt) comes nat’ral me; friends dear, I heer. --Which verse,’ said Mr. Peggotty, surprised find out, ‘though I had not intentions.’ ‘Are going back many thousand miles, soon?’ asked Agnes. ‘Yes, madam,’ he returned. ‘I giv promise Them’ly, afore I come away. You see, I doen’t grow younger years comes round, I had not sailed ‘it was, like I should not never done ‘t. And it is allus mind, I must come see Mas’r Davy sweet blooming self, wedded happiness, afore I got old.’ He looked us, he could never feast his eyes us sufficiently. Agnes laughingly put back scattered locks his grey hair, he might see us better. ‘And tell us,’ said I, ‘everything relating fortunes.’ ‘Our fortuns, Mas’r Davy,’ he rejoined, ‘is soon told. We have not fared nohows, fared thrive. We have allus thrived. We have worked ought ‘t, maybe lived leetle hard first so, allus thrived. What sheep-farming, stock-farming, one thing t’other, well do, well could be. Theer’s kiender blessing fell upon us,’ said Mr. Peggotty, reverentially inclining his head, ‘and we have done nowt prosper. That is, long run. If yesterday, today. If today, tomorrow.’ ‘And Emily?’ said Agnes I, together. ‘Them’ly,’ said he, ‘arter left her, madam--and I never heerd her saying her prayers night, t’other side canvas screen, settled Bush, I heerd name--and arter she lost sight Mas’r Davy, theer shining sundown--was low, first, that, she know’d Mas’r Davy kep us kind thowtful, ‘it is opinion she would drooped away. But theer poor folks aboard illness among ‘them, she took care them; theer children company, she took care them; she got busy, good, helped her.’ ‘When she first hear it?’ I asked. ‘I kep her arter I heerd ‘t,’ said Mr. Peggotty, ‘going nigh year. We living solitary place, among beautifullest trees, roses a-covering Beein roof. Theer come along one day, I a-working land, traveller Norfolk Suffolk England (I doen’t rightly mind which), course took in, giv eat drink, made welcome. We that, colony over. He would got old newspaper him, account print storm. That is she know’d it. When I came home night, I found she know’d it.’ He dropped his voice he said words, gravity I well remembered overspread his face. ‘Did change her much?’ asked. ‘Aye, good long time,’ he said, shaking his head; ‘if present hour. But I think solitoode done her good. And she deal mind way poultry like, minded it, come through. I wonder,’ he said thoughtfully, ‘if could see Them’ly now, Mas’r Davy, whether you would know her!’ ‘Is she altered?’ I inquired. ‘I doen’t know. I see her ev’ry day, doen’t know; But, odd-times, I thowt so. A slight figure,’ said Mr. Peggotty, looking fire, ‘kiender worn; soft, sorrowful, blue eyes; delicate face; pritty head, leaning little down; quiet voice way--timid a’most. That is Them’ly!’ We silently observed he sat, still looking fire. ‘Some thinks,’ he said, ‘as her affection ill-bestowed; some, her marriage broken death. No one knows ‘it is. She might married well, mort times, “but, uncle,” she says me, “that is gone ever.” Cheerful along me; retired others by; fond going distance fur teach child, fur tend sick person, fur kindness tow’rds young girl’s wedding (and she is done many, never seen one); fondly loving her uncle; patient; liked young old; sowt trouble. That is Them’ly!’ He drew his hand across his face, half-suppressed sigh looked fire. ‘Is Martha yet?’ I asked. ‘Martha,’ he replied, ‘got married, Mas’r Davy, second year. A young man, farm-labourer, come us his way market his mas’r’s drays--a journey five hundred mile, theer back--made offers fur take her fur his wife (wives scarce theer), set fur two selves Bush. She spoke fur tell her trew story. I did. They married, live fower hundred mile away voices singing birds.’ ‘Mrs. Gummidge?’ I suggested. It pleasant key touch, Mr. Peggotty suddenly burst roar laughter, rubbed his hands his legs, he accustomed he enjoyed long-shipwrecked boat. ‘Would believe it!’ he said. ‘Why, someun even made offer fur marry her! If ship’s cook turning settler, Mas’r Davy, did not make offers fur marry Missis Gummidge, I am Gormed--and I cannot say fairer that!’ I never saw Agnes laugh so. This sudden ecstasy part Mr. Peggotty delightful her, she could leave laughing; she laughed she made laugh, greater Mr. Peggotty’s ecstasy became, he rubbed his legs. ‘And Mrs. Gummidge say?’ I asked, I grave enough. ‘If you will believe me,’ returned Mr. Peggotty, ‘Missis Gummidge, ‘stead saying “thank you, I am much obleeged you, I are not a-going fur change condition time life,” up’d bucket standing by, laid theer ship’s cook’s head ‘till he sung fur help, I went reskied him.’ Mr. Peggotty burst great roar laughter, Agnes I kept company. ‘But I must say this, good creetur,’ he resumed, wiping his face, quite exhausted; ‘she she said she would us, more. She is willingest, trewest, honestest-helping woman, Mas’r Davy, ever draw’d breath life. I never know’d her lone lorn, single minute, even colony afore us, new it. And thinking old ‘un thing she never done, I assure you, since she left England!’ ‘Now, last, least, Mr. Micawber,’ said I. ‘He paid every obligation he incurred here--even Traddles’s bill, remember dear Agnes--and therefore may take granted he well. But latest news him?’ Mr. Peggotty, smile, put his hand his breast-pocket, produced flat-folded, paper parcel, he took out, much care, little odd-looking newspaper. ‘You understan’, Mas’r Davy,’ said he, ‘as left Bush now, well do; gone right away round Port Middlebay Harbour, wheer theer’s call town.’ ‘Mr. Micawber Bush near you?’ said I. ‘Bless you, yes,’ said Mr. Peggotty, ‘and turned will. I never wish meet better gen’l’man turning will. I have seen theer bald head his perspiring sun, Mas’r Davy, till I a’most thowt would melted away. And he is Magistrate.’ ‘A Magistrate, eh?’ said I. Mr. Peggotty pointed certain paragraph newspaper, I read aloud follows, Port Middlebay Times: ‘The public dinner distinguished fellow-colonist townsman, WILKINS MICAWBER, ESQUIRE, Port Middlebay District Magistrate, came yesterday large room Hotel, crowded suffocation. It estimated fewer forty-seven persons must accommodated dinner one time, exclusive company passage stairs. The beauty, fashion, exclusiveness Port Middlebay, flocked honour one deservedly esteemed, highly talented, widely popular. Doctor Mell (of Colonial Salem-House Grammar School, Port Middlebay) presided, his right sat distinguished guest. After removal cloth, singing Non Nobis (beautifully executed, loss distinguish bell-like notes gifted amateur, WILKINS MICAWBER, ESQUIRE, JUNIOR), usual loyal patriotic toasts severally given rapturously received. Doctor Mell, speech replete feeling, proposed “Our distinguished Guest, ornament town. May he never leave us better himself, may his success among us render his bettering impossible!” The cheering toast received defies description. Again rose fell, like waves ocean. At length hushed, WILKINS MICAWBER, ESQUIRE, presented return thanks.

We talked much Mr. Micawber, many evenings Mr. Peggotty remained us. He lived us whole term his stay,--which, I think, something less month,--and his sister aunt came London see him. Agnes I parted aboard-ship, he sailed; shall never part more, earth. But he left, he went Yarmouth, see little tablet I put churchyard memory Ham. While I copying plain inscription his request, I saw stoop, gather tuft grass grave little earth. ‘For Them’ly,’ he said, he put his breast. ‘I promised, Mas’r Davy.’ CHAPTER 64. A LAST RETROSPECT And written story ends. I look back, more--for last time--before I close leaves. I see myself, Agnes side, journeying along road life. I see children friends around us; I hear roar many voices, indifferent I travel on. What faces distinct fleeting crowd? Lo, these; turning I ask thoughts question! Here aunt, stronger spectacles, old woman four-score years more, upright yet, steady walker six miles stretch winter weather. Always her, comes Peggotty, good old nurse, likewise spectacles, accustomed needle-work night close lamp, never sitting without bit wax candle, yard-measure little house, work-box picture St. Paul’s upon lid. The cheeks arms Peggotty, hard red childish days, I wondered birds did not peck her preference apples, shrivelled now; her eyes, used darken whole neighbourhood her face, fainter (though glitter still); her rough forefinger, I associated pocket nutmeg-grater, same, I see least child catching totters aunt her, I think little parlour home, I could scarcely walk. My aunt’s old disappointment set right, now. She godmother real living Betsey Trotwood; Dora (the next order) says she spoils her. There something bulky Peggotty’s pocket. It nothing smaller Crocodile Book, rather dilapidated condition time, divers leaves torn stitched across, Peggotty exhibits children precious relic. I find curious see infant face, looking Crocodile stories; reminded old acquaintance Brooks Sheffield. Among boys, summer holiday time, I see old man making giant kites, gazing air, delight words. He greets rapturously, whispers, many nods winks, ‘Trotwood, glad hear I shall finish Memorial I nothing else do, aunt’s extraordinary woman world, sir!’ Who bent lady, supporting herself stick, showing countenance traces old pride beauty, feebly contending querulous, imbecile, fretful wandering mind? She garden; near her stands sharp, dark, withered woman, white scar her lip. Let hear say. ‘Rosa, I forgotten gentleman’s name.’ Rosa bends her, calls her, ‘Mr. Copperfield.’ ‘I glad see you, sir. I sorry observe mourning. I hope Time good you.’ Her impatient attendant scolds her, tells her I mourning, bids her look again, tries rouse her. ‘You seen son, sir,’ says elder lady. ‘Are reconciled?’ Looking fixedly me, she puts her hand her forehead, moans. Suddenly, she cries, terrible voice, ‘Rosa, come me. He dead!’ Rosa kneeling her feet, turns caresses her, quarrels her; fiercely telling her, ‘I loved better ever did!’--now soothing her sleep her breast, like sick child. Thus I leave them; thus I always find them; thus wear time away, year year. What ship comes sailing home India, English lady this, married growling old Scotch Croesus great flaps ears? Can Julia Mills? Indeed Julia Mills, peevish fine, black man carry cards letters her golden salver, copper-coloured woman linen, bright handkerchief round her head, serve her Tiffin her dressing-room. But Julia keeps diary days; never sings Affection’s Dirge; eternally quarrels old Scotch Croesus, sort yellow bear tanned hide. Julia steeped money throat, talks thinks nothing else. I liked her better Desert Sahara. Or perhaps IS Desert Sahara! For, though Julia stately house, mighty company, sumptuous dinners every day, I see green growth near her; nothing ever come fruit flower. What Julia calls ‘society’, I see; among Mr. Jack Maldon, his Patent Place, sneering hand gave him, speaking Doctor ‘so charmingly antique’. But society name hollow gentlemen ladies, Julia, breeding professed indifference everything advance retard mankind, I think must lost Desert Sahara, better find way out. And lo, Doctor, always good friend, labouring his Dictionary (somewhere letter D), happy his home wife. Also Old Soldier, considerably reduced footing, means influential days yore! Working his chambers Temple, busy aspect, his hair (where he bald) made rebellious ever constant friction his lawyer’s-wig, I come, later time, upon dear old Traddles. His table covered thick piles papers; I say, I look around me: ‘If Sophy clerk, now, Traddles, she would enough do!’ ‘You may say that, dear Copperfield! But capital days, too, Holborn Court! Were not?’ ‘When she told would judge? But town talk then!’ ‘At events,’ says Traddles, ‘if I ever one--’ ‘Why, know be.’ ‘Well, dear Copperfield, WHEN I one, I shall tell story, I said I would.’ We walk away, arm arm. I going family dinner Traddles. It Sophy’s birthday; and, road, Traddles discourses good fortune he enjoyed. ‘I really able, dear Copperfield, I heart. There is Reverend Horace promoted living four hundred fifty pounds year; two boys receiving best education, distinguishing steady scholars good fellows; three girls married comfortably; three living us; three keeping house Reverend Horace since Mrs. Crewler’s decease; happy.’ ‘Except--’ I suggest. ‘Except Beauty,’ says Traddles. ‘Yes. It unfortunate she marry vagabond. But certain dash glare caught her. However, got her safe house, got rid him, must cheer her again.’ Traddles’s house one houses--or easily may been--which he Sophy used parcel out, evening walks. It large house; Traddles keeps his papers his dressing-room his boots his papers; he Sophy squeeze upper rooms, reserving best bedrooms Beauty girls. There room spare house; ‘the girls’ here, always here, accident other, I know count. Here, go in, crowd them, running door, handing Traddles kissed, he breath. Here, established perpetuity, poor Beauty, widow little girl; here, dinner Sophy’s birthday, three married girls three husbands, one husband’s brothers, another husband’s cousin, another husband’s sister, appears engaged cousin. Traddles, exactly simple, unaffected fellow he ever was, sits foot large table like Patriarch; Sophy beams upon him, head, across cheerful space certainly glittering Britannia metal. And now, I close task, subduing desire linger yet, faces fade away. But one face, shining like Heavenly light I see objects, beyond all. And remains. I turn head, see it, beautiful serenity, beside me. My lamp burns low, I written far night; dear presence, without I nothing, bears company. O Agnes, O soul, may thy face I close life indeed; may I, realities melting me, like shadows I dismiss, still find thee near me, pointing upward!
