 ST. WINIFRED'S, OR, THE WORLD OF SCHOOL. CHAPTER ONE. WALTER'S HOME. The merry homes England! Around hearths night, What gladsome looks household love, Meet ruddy light! Mrs Hemans. "Good-bye, Walter; good-bye, Walter dear! good-bye!" last note chorus "Dood-bye," blue-eyed, fair-haired girl two years, Walter disengaged his arms his mother's neck, sprang carriage already waiting quarter hour convey his luggage station. It old, old story: Mr Evson taking his son large public school, first time Walter left home. Nearly every father deigns open little book gone scene himself; he his sons know personal experience thoughts, sensations, memories, occupied minds Walter Evson his father, carriage drove garden gate village street, bearing eldest boy young family sacred quiet shelter loving home, noisy independent life among number strange young companions. If ever stood hill Walter caught last glimpse home he leaving, waved his final farewell his mother, likely forgotten scene spread eyes. On right-hand side, low hills, covered firs, rise gentle slopes one other, till reach huge green shoulder mountain, around whose summits clouds generally weaving awful ever-changing diadem. To left, road lower range wooded undulations, deep retired glen, mountain stream babbles along hurried course, tumbling sometimes noisy cataract rushing wildly rough boulder stones carried heights, deepening quiet pool, bright smooth glass, margin great purple loosestrife long fern-leaves bend though gaze reflected beauty. In front, feet, opens rich valley, almost filled far roots mountains lovely lake. Beside lake white houses little village cluster around elevation church churchyard stand; either shore, rising among fir-groves overshadow first swellings hills, sequestered villas, commanding prospect rare beauty, giving last touch interest surrounding view. In one houses--that one crowded gables hundred feet lake, opposite see swans pluming wings sunlight, green boat little boathouse--lived hero story; boy could dearer lovelier home. His father, Mr Evson, man easy, almost affluent circumstances, who, regular occupation, chosen quiet retreat, devoted his time care education his family, ordinary duties country gentleman. Walter eldest child, graceful, active, bright-eyed boy. Up time--and he thirteen years old--he teaching his father, tutor, last year lived house. His education, therefore, differed considerably many boys his age, amount book knowledge he acquired small yet; he full intelligent interest things worth knowing, best surest guarantee future progress. Let pause moment relate refined simple-hearted gentleman hitherto brought his young boys. I pronounce whether method right wrong; I describe was, success failure must inferred following pages. The positive teaching young Evsons begin early. Till ten twelve years old nearly know come either intuitively without conscious labour. They allowed almost live open air, nature wise tender teacher. Some object invented, possible, every walk. Now find shy recesses wood wild strawberries thickest, white violets rarest orchis flowers hid; climb along rocky sides glen seek best spot rustic meal, find mossy stones flower-banks seats tables near waterfall pool. When little older father would amuse encourage toiled even summit nearest hills, would catch fresh breeze blew far-off sea, gaze wonderingly summer lightning flashing behind chain hills, watch, many playful fancies, long gorgeous conflagration summer sunset. And excursions father mother would teach without seeming teach them, thoroughly familiar names properties commonest plants, eagerly interested secure little collections, plant gardens, different varieties wild flowers found home. Or, again, sat garden, wandered back autumn twilight gipsy party, taught recognise stars planets, Mars Jupiter, Orion Cassiopeia, Pleiads Northern Crown, seemed look upon like old beloved friends. It easy, too, pleasant, teach love treat tenderly living things--to observe little black-eyed squirrel without disturbing he cracked his nuts; watch mistle-thrush's nest till timid bird learned sit fearlessly, scurry away approach; visit haunts moorhen without causing consternation her her little black velvet progeny. Visitors stayed house always delighted see creatures seemed trust children: canary would carol cage came room; ponies would come trotting boys across field, swans float plume mantling wings, expecting food caresses, whenever came sight. The lake source endless amusement them; summer winter might seen bathing waters, till bold swimmers, lying read books boat shade trees, rowing till little boy six years allowed paddle alone side, even waves rough, winds high, elder ones afraid venture out. In short, healthy manly mountain-boys, senses admirably exercised, powers observation well trained, sometimes amazed London cousins pointing falcon poised far-off prey, speck less practised eyes, calling attention sweetness wood-bird's note, indistinguishable less practised ears. Even lessons would made little progress trained nursery hardy, modest, truthful, unselfish, obedient. This work effectually done alone _can_ effectually done, earliest childhood, sweet plastic nature may acquire right good powerful aid habit, passions fully conscious dangerous stubborn power. Let one say I describing youthful prodigies. There thousands I describe happy well-ordered English homes; might thousands parents spent thoughtful care upon growth children; many, many thousands world, "in rich dawn ampler day," gradual yet noble progress social moral improvement, becomes purer holier, like Him Who came ideal loftiest, yet lowliest, clear-sighted, yet loving, happy, yet humble manhood. CHAPTER TWO. SAINT WINIFRED'S. Gay Hope Fancy led, Less pleasing possess'd, The tear forgot soon she would, The sunshine breast. Grey. Walter's destination school Saint Winifred. Let say reader set discover school Saint Winifred is, he necessarily fail. It impossible, I suppose, describe _any_ school without introducing circumstances apparently special lead readers supposed identification. But here, all, I distinctly seriously repudiate intention describing particular foundation. I well aware critics disclaimer insufficient. But every _honourable_ reader critic may rest assured describing Saint Winifred's I intended depict one school, single word dictated unworthy personality find place following pages. Saint Winifred's School stands seaside, shores little bay embraced closed range hills whose sweeping semicircle terminated either side lofty cliffs which, places, fringed base margin sand shingle, others descend sheer precipices ever-boiling surf. Owing mountainous nature country, railroad cannot approach within distance five miles, reach school must drive dark groves cover lower shoulder one surrounding mountains. When reach summit ascent, bay Saint Winifred lies you; line white houses quarter mile shore village, large picturesque building old grey stone, standing angle little river reaches sea, Saint Winifred's School. The carriage stopped grand Norman archway court. The school porter--the Famulus classically called him--a fine-looking man, whose honest English face showed amount thought refinement his station, opened gate, and, consigning Walter's play-box portmanteau one school servants, directed Mr Evson across court along cloisters house Dr Lane, headmaster. The entering Walter's name school books soon accomplished, he assigned private pupil Mr Robertson, one tutors. Dr Lane spoke word encouragement young stranger, he walked back his father across court gate, carriage still waiting take Mr Evson meet next train. "Please let us walk top hill, papa," said Walter; "I shall not wanted till tea-time, I need not bid good-bye here." Mr Evson little anxious Walter hasten parting. They never separated before. Mr Evson could look back rare period thirteen years, enjoyed, God's blessing, almost uninterrupted happiness. He begun life his young children; he could thoroughly sympathise alike thoughts thoughtlessness, training manner wise firm, he spared greater part anxiety disappointment generally spring mismanagement. He deeply loved, heartily proud of, his eldest boy. There exaggeration saying Walter best gifts parent could desire. There something interesting his appearance, winning his modest graceful manners. It impossible see struck his fine open face, look fearless noble innocence his deep blue eyes. It time moral lectures formal advice. People seem think Polonius-like apophthegms delivered time may great importance. They may be, perhaps, backed-up enforced previous years silent self-denying example; otherwise like seed sown upon rock, like thistle-down blown wind across sea. Mr Evson spoke Walter chiefly home, writing letters, his pocket-money, his amusements, his studies, Walter knew well beforehand, without repetitions _then_, his father wished be, principles accordance he endeavoured mould his thoughts actions. The time passed quickly both; soon top hill carriage awaited them. "Good-bye, Walter. God bless you," said Mr Evson, shaking hands last time, throwing deep meaning simple words. "Good-bye, papa. My best love home," said Walter, trying speak cheerfully, struggling manfully repress his rising tears. The carriage drove on. Walter watched sight, and, turning round, felt new phase his life begun, he miserably alone. It natural he she would quiet tears he thought dear friends he parted, four hundred strangers whose society he enter. Yet brave innocent he feared nothing, and, without definite religious consciousness, he clear vivid sense One Friend ever him. The emotions boy transient keen, Walter's tears soon dried. As he looked round, old familiar voice mountains his ears. He gazed delight friendship towering summits, promised himself, many exhilarating climb steep sides. And now, too, first time--for hitherto he much noticed scenery around him--a new voice, great voice sea, broke grand awful monotony upon his listening ear. As he gazed upon waves, glowing flashing golden network autumnal sunbeams, seemed dawn upon like discovery new sense, he determined stroll beach re-entering gates Saint Winifred. He wandered boy's delight, delight boy whose eyes ears always open beauty wonder outer world. He longed his brother there. He picked handfuls hard sparkling sand; he sent broad flat pebbles flying surface, skimming crests waves; he half-filled his pockets green yellow shells, crimson fragments Delessaria Sanguinea his little sisters; he full pleasurable excitement great clock Saint Winifred's, striking five, reminded he better go in, learn something, possible, order his future life. CHAPTER THREE. NEW BOYS. _Parolles_.--I find tongue foolhardy. All's Well Ends Well, Act four, scene 1. The Famulus--"familiar"--as boys called him, directed Walter across court rooms his housekeeper, informed places his clothes his play-boxes would kept, dormitory he sleep. She also gave key desk great schoolroom, he might, he chose, keep his portable property. She moreover announced, significance, she glad anything lay her humble power, day to-morrow her birthday. Walter little puzzled relevancy latter piece information. He learnt subsequent period, he also discovered Mrs Higgins found her interest periodical birthdays, recurring two three times least every half-year. The years must passed good lady's head Walter's stay Saint Winifred's--the premature rapidity old age must subsequently overtaken her, vigour she displayed advanced period life--were something quite extraordinary kind. Towards great schoolroom Walter accordingly directed his steps. The key turned quite superfluous, hasp lock broken Walter's predecessor, also left trace his name, his likeness, many interesting though inexplicable designs hieroglyphics, red-hot poker, lid. The gentleman, judge appearances, must curious entomological collection spiders earwigs his protection, bequeathed Walter highly miscellaneous legacy rubbish. Walter contemplated his bequest dismay, began busily dust interior desk, make fit receptacle he could his writing materials personal possessions. While thus engaged he could help secretly tickled proceedings group boys standing round large unlighted stove, amusing themselves, harmlessly part, inexperience idiosyncrasies various newcomers. After tiring freaks mad Irish boy entered spirit his cross-examination high sense buffoonery refused grow ill-tempered, playing extreme gullibility heavy, open-mouthed, bullet-headed fellow, named Plumber, astounding information could extract greater evidence sensation little wider stare eyes, unexcited drawl "Really though?" One group, named Henderson, merry-looking boy ceaseless pleasant twinkle eyes, taxing his invention uttermost without least exciting Plumber's credulity. "You saw fellow let school gates, Plumber?" said Henderson. "Yes; I saw someone other." "But notice particularly?" "No, I did not notice him." "Well, done. That man's called `the Familiar.' Ask anyone he is not? But know why?" "No," said Plumber. "It is he is got familiar spirit waits him," said Henderson mysteriously. "Really though," said Plumber, time he looked frightened impossible rest avoid bursting fit laughter, Plumber, vaguely comprehending he considered good joke, retired discomfiture. "You fools," said Henderson; "if you would given little time I would made believe Lane tail, wore his gown conceal it, except he used flog with; entered he would sing song standing his head. You have quite spoilt game bursting laughing." "There is another new fellow," said Kenrick, one group. "Come here, new fellow!" called two three them. Walter looked up, thinking he addressed, found summons meant boy, rather good-looking slender, whose self-important attitude supercilious look betrayed slight amount vanity, who, apparent astonishment rest, surveying room appurtenances look great affectation disdain. "So do not much seem like look Saint Winifred's," said Kenrick him, boy walked delicate air. "Not much," lisped new boy; "everything looks common." "Common unclean last degree," said Henderson, imitating his manner. "And place sit in?" "O, means," said Henderson; "each us private apartment furnished crimson gold, according simple yet elegant taste owner. Our meals served us kneeling domestics little dishes silver." "I suppose intend wit," said new boy languidly. "Yes; you, wit," answered Henderson; "but seriously though, would great deal like accustomed to, would not it, friend?" "Very much more," said boy. "And would politely favour company," said Henderson, obsequious courtesy, "by revealing us name?" "My name Howard Tracy." "Oh, indeed!" said Henderson, air great satisfaction, making low bow. "I called Howard Tracy I descended lineally noble families." "My goodness! really!" said Henderson, clasping his hands mock transport. "My dear sir, honour race country! honour school. By Jove, proud, sir, among us!" "Perhaps may know uncle Viscount Saint George," said Tracy patronisingly. "Is he, though, George!" said Henderson yawning. "Is Saint George who-- "`Swinged dragon, ever since Sits his horseback mine hostess' door?'" But finding boy's vanity obtuse amusing longer, he leave rest, Jones caught sight Walter, called out:-- "Halloa, here is new fellow grinning follies his kind. Come here, dark-haired chap. What is name?" "Evson," said Walter, quietly approaching them. Before getting fun necessary see kind boy he was; Jones hardly knew line take, he began commonest vulgar tack catechising his family relations. "What is father?" "My father gentleman," said Walter, rather surprised rudeness question. "And live?" "At Semlyn." "And old you?" "Just thirteen." "And many sisters you?" Walter rather thought asking, "What is you?" he saw particular harm answering question, want seem stiff-backed, he answered, "Three." "And beautiful?" "I do not know; I never asked them. Are yours?" This last question perfectly quiet unexpected, Jones evidently discomfited it, rest burst roar laughter, Henderson said, "You have caught tartar, Jones. You cannot drop salt bird's tail. You better return Plumber, Saint George dragon. Here, noble Viscount, think coeval? Is he common rest us?" "I do not think anything him, mean Viscount," said Tracy peevishly, beginning last understand making fool him. "Quite right, Saint George; he is beneath notice." Tracy ran his hand his scented hair, he rather Implied he was; mortified contrast his credulous vanity Walter's manly simplicity, anxious possible regain his position, he said angrily Walter, "What looking for?" Not wishing rude, Walter turned away, someone observed, "A cat may look king." "Ay, cat king, I grant you," answered Henderson; "but mere son Eve Howard Tracy." "You laughing me," said Tracy Walter again, still angrier tone, seeing Walter smile Henderson's remark. "I have slightest wish laugh you," said Walter. "Yes he has. Shy him," said Jones, putting great bit orange peel Tracy's hand. Tracy threw Walter, he without hesitation picked up, flung back Tracy's face. "A fight! fight!" shouted mischief-making group, Tracy made blind blow Walter, his antagonist easily parried. "Make fight you. Challenge him," said Jones. "Invite milling-ground behind chapel first school to-morrow morning." "Pistols _two_, coffee four, eight to-morrow," said Henderson. "Trample Dragon's tail, someone, rouse occasion. What! he will not come scratch? Alack! alack! "`What ennoble fools cowards Not blood Tracys, Dragons, Howards!'" He continued mischievously, he saw Tracy, taking note Walter's compact figure, showed signs declining combat. "Hush, Henderson," said Kenrick, one group taken part talk; "it is shame setting two new fellows fighting first evening." But Henderson's last remark much Tracy. "Will fight?" he said, walking Walter reddening cheeks. For Tracy school before, novice ways boys. "Certainly not," said Walter coolly, everybody's great surprise. "What! chap showing white feather, too. _All_ new fellows cowards seems time," said Jones. "This will never do. Pitch him, Tracy." "Stop," said Kenrick; "let us hear first he will not fight?" "Because I see occasion to," said Walter; "and because, second place, I never could fight cold blood; because, third place--" "Well, third place?" said Kenrick, interested observe Walter's hesitation. "In third place," said Walter, "I do not say conceit--but boy's match me." To anyone glanced figures two boys obvious enough, although Walter year younger two. The rest began respect Walter accordingly sensible little man, Tracy greatly offended last remark, Jones, bully grudge Walter baffling his impertinence, exclaimed, "Do not afraid, Tracy. I will back you. Give something heat his cold blood." Fired taunts encouragements, Tracy he bid, struck Walter face. The boy started angrily, first seemed he meant return blow compound interest, suddenly changing his intention, he seized Tracy round waist, spite kicking struggling, fairly carried humiliated descendant Howards Tracys far corner room, where, amid shout laughter, he deposited laconic suggestion, "Do not fool." Walter's blood up, thinking he might well show, first, he bullied, made butt impunity, he walked straight stove, looking full Jones (who inspired already strong disgust), he said, "You called coward now; I am coward, though I do not like fighting nothing. I am bit afraid _you_, though forced fellow hit now." "Are not you? Saucy young cub! Then take that," said Jones, enforcing remark box ear. "And take that," said Walter, returning compliment much energy he playing game _Gif es wetter_. Jones, astonished beyond measure, sprang forward, clenched his two fists, squared, blustered great demonstrativeness. He much Walter's senior, utterly taken surprise his audacity; he seemed hurry avenge insult. "Well," said Walter, heaving indignation, "why do not hit again?" Jones looked his firm determined little assailant alarm, slowly tucked sleeves his coat, turned white red, and--did not return blow. The tea-bell beginning ring moment gave convenient excuse breaking altercation. He told his friends he point thrashing Walter bell rang, he thought shame fight new fellow--"and cold blood, too," he added, adopting Walter's language, his sincerity. "Do not call coward then," said Walter he turned away. "I say, Evson, you are regular brick, regular stunner," said young Kenrick, delighted, he showed Walter way Hall boys tea. "That fellow Jones end bully, he will not quite big future. You have taken great many pegs." "I say, Kenrick," shouted Henderson them, "I bet five one I know you are saying new fellow." "I bet do not," said Kenrick, laughing. "You are saying--it is quotation, know, never mind--you are saying him, `A sudden thought strikes me: let us swear eternal friendship.'" "Then you are quite out," answered Kenrick. "I saying come sit next tea." "And go shares jam," added Henderson: "exactly I said, words." CHAPTER FOUR. FRIENDS AND FOES. "He hath thousand friends hath one friend spare, And he hath one enemy shall meet everywhere." Already Walter got someone talk to, someone he knew; spite Kenrick's repudiation Henderson's jest, he felt already he discovered boy he soon friends. It does not matter he discovered it; animal magnetism; look Kenrick's eyes; his light-heartedness; mingled fire refinement his face spoke wilful impetuous, yet also generous noble nature. Already he felt sense ease pleasure certainty Kenrick--evidently cipher among his schoolfellows--was inclined like him, show ways school. They went large hall, four hundred meals. They sat number tables arranged breadth-wise across hall; twenty thirty sat table, either master monitor (as sixteen upper boys called) took his place head it. "Now, mind do not begin smoke," said Henderson, Walter went in, found boys already seated. "Smoke?" said Walter, taking bit good advice; "do fellows smoke Hall? I never smoked." "Why, you are smoking now," said Henderson, Walter, entering among crowd strange faces meeting many pairs eyes, began blush little. "Do not teaze him, Flip," said Kenrick. "Smoking name fellows give blushing, Evson; see given blushing, they will stare fun seeing colour mount cheeks." Accordingly, he sat down, he saw numerous eyes turned upon upon Tracy, happened sit table. Tracy, unaccustomed narrow scrutiny, blushed over; and, he vain looked down, way that, his cheeks grew hotter hotter, he moved uneasy way, great amusement his many tormentors, last his eyes subsided finally his teacup, he venture raise tea over. But Walter trick, felt thoroughly obliged Henderson Kenrick telling it. So he waited till he saw good dozen fellows intently staring him; then, looking simply naturally, he met gaze two three steadily succession, stared countenance quiet smile. This turned laugh them; he heard remark he "up snuff, mistake." No one ever tried make Walter smoke again, time used regular joke pass round word tea-time, "Let us make Tracy smoke," Tracy always _did_ smoke till he got thoroughly used it, he generally glad tea-time over. In spite Henderson, poked fun tea-time (till he saw he really embarrassed them, he desisted), Kenrick sat Walter, took less his protection; "old boy" always patronise newcomer first, even age. From Kenrick Walter learnt, rather his dismay, he really would place sit except big schoolroom, he would share fifty others, he would placed dormitory least five six besides himself. "Have examined yet?" asked Kenrick. "No; Dr Lane asked books I read, he told I go take chance Mr Paton's form. What form that?" "It is call Virgil form. Have ever read Virgil?" "No; least easy bits." "I wish joy, then." "Why? sort fellow Mr Paton?" "Mr Paton? he is man all; he is machine; he is wheel mill; he is cast-iron automaton; he is--" "The abomination desolation spoken Daniel prophet," observed Henderson, caught fragment conversation. "I am his form, too, worse luck!" "Hush! shut up, Henderson, do not profane," said Kenrick. "Well, Evson, you will soon find Paton's like; anything `a patten bright gold' rate." "Oh! oh! turn his bad pun," said Henderson, hitting pellet bread, offence he immediately received "fifty lines" master end table. "Do not abuse Paton," said boy named Daubeny, name Henderson long ago contracted Dubbs. "I always found capital master under, really kind." "Oh, _you_--yes," answered Kenrick; "if gifted mouselike stillness school, dear old Dubbs--" "And metallic capacity grind, dear old Dubbs," added Henderson. "And ostrich-like digestion crabbed rules, dear old Dubbs; why, then," said Kenrick, "we boys Paton's heart." "Or Paton's pattern," suggested Henderson; Kenrick's turn shudder miserable attempt pun, return Henderson's missile, whereupon he got _hundred_ lines, made pull long face. "Who is tutor, Evson?" he asked interlude. "I suppose you are going pick pieces, now," said Daubeny, smiling; "do not believe half say him, Evson." "Oh, you are sharp, successful, polite, gentlemanly, jolly, sort thing, he will like much, exceedingly kind you; lazy, mischievous, stupid, pickle, he will ignore you, snub you, will not speak you. I wish you would pupil-room me." "Depends he is, O virtuous Dubbs," said Henderson. "His end shall `pieces,' _Punch_ says, he deserves it." "He told I Mr Robertson's pupil," said Walter. "Hum-m!" observed Kenrick. "Why, sort person he?" "Some his pups detest him, others adore him." "Why?" "Who is tutor, then?" "Percival; there, master chatting laughing monitors. He is regular brick. _Plinthos estin_ say Greek," said Kenrick. "Halloa! tea's over." "And you have chattering much new fellow's none," said Henderson, bell rang one monitors read short Latin grace. The boys streamed out, Kenrick helped his new friend unpack his books treasures, put his desk, ordered new lock. The rest evening occupied "Evening Work," time boys certain form sat schoolroom, prepared lessons next day, master occupied desk superintend keep order. As boys form work, Walter suppose work would expected next morning, he therefore occupied his time writing long letter home. When he began talking Henderson, he thousand questions ask, whose chief amusement seemed consist chaffing everybody, whom, nevertheless, everybody seemed regard friend. At nine bell rang, whole school went chapel, short evening service held, higher forms, boys separate rooms, went bed. As Walter lay sleep, he felt least century older he done morning. Everything marvellously new him, whole he inclined take bright view things. Two things happened gave special delight: sight sea, happy dawn--for he regarded it--of genuine, hearty, boyish friendship, Henderson Kenrick. When gas turned off, tired his journey his excitement, he quickly fell asleep. And, falling asleep, he passed land dreams. He sea Kenrick Henderson row-boat, three fishing. First pull Henderson's line, and, tugging up, he caught fish, Jones, who, flounderings, lay fish-basket. As least surprise them, excited remark whatever, set work again, Kenrick bite time, proved Howard Tracy, laid quietly bottom boat, Jones assisting. The third time Walter tug, act hauling Dubbs, he became conscious boat rocking violently, he felt rather surprised he seasick. This seemed give new current his thoughts, sudden he riding someone, his horse began rear uncomfortable manner, right his hind legs. He kept his seat manfully--but no! last rear much, and, suddenly waking, he aware his bed rising falling series heavy shakes bumps, whereby he nearly flung mattress. He instantly guessed because, indeed, Kenrick given hint possibility. He knew someone, wishing frighten him, got bed, heaving his back. All he noticed he undressed was, several big fellows dormitory, he knew room rather bad reputation disorder bullying. Being strong little fellow, brave lion, active, Walter afraid one; springing momentary cessation mysterious upheavals, he instantly made dash bed, seized someone leg. The leg kicked violently, leg particularly strong limb, succeeded disengaging Walter's hands, not, however, till left slipper trophy; slipper Walter pursued dim white figure, he could see scuttling away darkness side room. This figure he overtook time give resounding smacks sole slipper; figure clutched counterpane nearest bed, flung Walter, made good escape, Walter entangled, Agamemnon-like, voluminous folds. Walter, however, still kept possession slipper, determined next morning discover owner. He knew probably bigger fellow playing game, his common sense told best take good-humouredly joke, yet time make little pleasant possible perpetrator, even he got thrashed himself. A bully joker practical jokes likely things certain amount discomfort, even he succeeds causing still greater amount someone else. Walter cared little adventure. It certainly annoyed little, showed others his dormitory must less brutes, could find amusing break sleep play fears new boy night his arrival among them. But he thought it, quite determined happen often. Far different case poor little Arthur Eden, another new boy, who, Walter observed, occupied bed next him. He roused his first sweet sleep way, time Walter. But one prepared annoyance, he timid child, filled terror; he even terrified he know was. He lay quite still, daring speak, make sound, clinging his mattress hands agony dread. He already worn bewildered events day. He fallen amongst Philistines; moment his arrival he got bad hands, hands boys made sport his weakness, corrupted his feelings, lacerated his heart. He young--a mere child twelve--and innocence his simplicity he unreservedly answered questions, prattled his home, his twin sister, nearly his cherished secrets. In short space time he afforded materials enough coarse jeers brutal, poignant ridicule cruel many long day. Something derision begun already, he found secret place hide his tears. That would call milksop, molly-coddle, kinds horrid names, he knew, he tried manfully bear-up persecution. It many hot silent drops relieved fever his overwrought brain, sleep come him, broken thus. O parents guardians--anxious, yet unwise class--why, tell why, knowing must know, send children school? Eden's mother, indeed, opposed step, his guardian (for boy's father dead), seeing he spoilt home, he naturally shrinking timid lad, urged he sent Saint Winifred's, vague notion making man him. He might well thrown piece Brussels lace fire intention changing open iron-work. The proper place little Eden would country parsonage, care kindliness might gradually helped him, he grew older, acquire faculties he not; whereas, case, public school impaired time tender frame bright yet delicate qualities he had. The big, clumsy never-do-well boy, Cradock name, choking secret laughter he tilted little Eden's bed--leaving pause frightful suspense let recover breath realise his situation--was raw ill-trained fellow like, he nothing wilfully diabolically wicked. If he similarly treated he would broken great guffaw, emptied his water-jug intruder; yet he could seen new boy moment, he would seen pretty little face--only meant yet smiles childhood--white almost idiotic terror, he would caught staring meaningless look glassy eyes naturally bright blue. But he really know--being merely overgrown stupid fellow--the mischief he doing, absolute horrible torment his jest (?) inflicting. Finding his joltings produced apparent effect, thinking Eden might, strange somnolence peculiar new boys, sleep all, he tilted bed little high, indeed wild shriek rang room mattress clothes tumbled right foot bed, flung child violently floor. Fortunately heap bed-clothes prevented much hurt, Cradock time pick huddle bed again, jump back his bed, lamp one masters, attracted Eden's cry, appeared door. The master, finding quiet, come distant room, supposed his ears deceived him, cry accidental noise outside building. He merely walked round room, seeing Eden's bed-clothes rather tumbled, kindly helped trembling child replace comfortable order, left room. "I say, that is quite enough one night," said voice one boys, master disappeared. "You new fellows go sleep. Nobody'll touch to-night." The speaker Franklin, rather scapegrace respects, boy unkindly nature. The light noise revealed Walter something must taken place. In his case, he cared little assurance he would molested night, feeling quite sure he could hold his anyone, his former enemy, rate, would likely assault again. But he very, glad poor little Eden's sake, caught momentary glimpse his scared pitiable look. Walter could sleep long time, till long he heard regular breathings others deep slumber. For sounds came Eden's bed disturbed his heart pity. His feelings bled poor little fellow, young fresh home, newcomer like himself, evidently little accustomed roughness little able protect his interests. For long time night he heard poor child crying sobbing himself, though he clearly trying stifle sound. At last Walter could stand longer, feeling sure rest sound asleep, he whispered his kindest tone, he did not know his neighbour's name-- "I say, little new fellow." The sound sobbing hushed moment, boy seemed afraid answer; Walter said again--"Are awake?" "Yes," said weak, childish voice. "Do not afraid; I am new fellow, too. Tell name." "Eden," he whispered tremulously, though reassured kindly tone voice. "Hush! hush! you will awake someone." "No, I will not," said Walter. "Here, I will come speak you;" stepping noiselessly bed, he whispered Eden's ear, "Never mind, poor little fellow; do not frightened; boy did not mean hurt you; he shoving bed joke. Someone me, I jumped licked slipper." "But I got frightened. Oh, think they will to-night?" "No, certainly, to-night," said Walter; "they are asleep; anyone another night, must slip bed mind it. It does not hurt." "Thank you," whispered Eden; "you are kind, nobody else kind here. Will tell _your_ name?" "My name's Walter Evson. Do know, voice look remind little brother. There," he said, tucking bed, "now good-night, go sleep." The little fellow pressed Walter's hand hard, said good-night, soon forgot his misery sleep pure weariness. I think he would slept night, comforting sense he found, lean upon, stronger nature stronger character his own. Walter heard breathing peacefully, he fell asleep, neither woke dreamt (that he aware of), half-past seven next morning, servant roused boys ringing large hand-bell ears. CHAPTER FIVE. SCHOOL TROUBLES. The sorrows thy youthful day Shall make thee wise coming years! The brightest rainbows ever play Above fountains tears. Mackay. Walter jumped began dress once; Eden, still looking pale frightened, soon followed his example, recognised smile gratitude. None five boys occupied room thought stirring chapel-bell began ring, left ample space quarter hour orisons, ablutions, necessary preparations! Walter, half-dressed, glanced got up, discover owner slipper, he still kept his possession. He watched one-sandalled enemy eagerly Pelias may supposed done. First Jones tumbled bed, even deigning surly recognition, Jones his right complement slippers. Then two fellows, named Anthony Franklin, quite big Jones; slippers right. Then Cradock, looked little shyly Eden, and, while, told he playing joke night before, sorry frightened him; last, Harpour, biggest lot. Harpour one fellows found every school, always dangerous characters: huge boy, low forms, strong, stupid work, rather good-looking, generally cut better sort, unredeemed natural taste accomplishment, wholly without influence except among little boys (whom he alternately bullied spoilt), kept school his friends, rather afraid him, quite know him. They called "keeping mischief," mischief he school thousandfold greater he could done elsewhere; for, except school, he would comparatively powerless positive harm. By exhaustive process reasoning, Walter already concluded Harpour must his nocturnal disturber; and, accordingly, thrusting foot slipper, Harpour began exclaim, "Hallo! where is slipper? Confound it, I shall late; I cannot dress; where is slipper?" Wishing leave without escape necessity betraying author last night's raid, Walter made sign, Harpour, time lose, said him-- "Hi! new chap, got slipper?" "I have got _a_ slipper," said Walter, blandly. "The deuce have. Then give here, minute." "I captured someone is leg, bed last night," said Walter, giving Harpour's hand. "The deuce did!" "Yes; I smacked fellow it, I again, he comes again." "The deuce will! Then take impudence," said Harpour, intending bring slipper his shoulder; Walter dodged down, parrying blow his arm, sent slipper graceful parabola across wash-hand-stand Jones's basin. "So, so," said Harpour, "_you're_ pretty cool hand, are! Well, I have time settle accounts now, I late chapel. But--" A significant pantomime explained remainder sentence, Harpour, standing his one slipper, hastily adjourned his toilet. Walter, dressed good time, knelt moments hearty prayer, helped poor Eden, helpless though he always dressed servant, finish dressing, ran across court chapel bell stopped. There still two minutes door shut, he occupied watching boys streamed in, many waistcoats half buttoned, others water-drops still dangling hastily combed hair. He saw Tracy saunter neat, languid air disapprobation, blushing withal he entered; Eden, whose large eyes looked bewildered he caught sight Walter sat beside him; Kenrick, beaming ever, nodded he passed by; Henderson, who, notwithstanding time place, found opportunity whisper hope he washed his desirable person clear water; Plumber looking his credulity gorged beyond endurance; Daubeny, eyes immovably fixed determination know his lessons day; lastly, Harpour, time scuffle hot, breathless, exceedingly untidy, chaplain began opening sentence. "Where I go now?" asked Eden, chapel over. "Well, Eden, I know little you. You would better ask tutor. Here, Kenrick," said Walter, "which black gowns Mr Robertson?--this fellow's tutor mine." Kenrick pointed one masters, Eden went; Walter asked, "Where I go Mr Paton's form?" "Here, let lead victim sacrifice," said Henderson. "O wreath cypress funeral yew, or--" "Nettles?" suggested Kenrick. "Observe, new boy," said Henderson, "your eternal friend's delicate insinuation donkey. Here, come I will take patted on." Henderson's exuberant spirits prevented his ever speaking without giving vent slang, bad puns, sheer good-humoured nonsense. "Are not form, Kenrick?" asked Walter, he saw diverging right. "Oh no! dear me, no!" said Henderson. "_I_ am, eternal friend least two forms higher; he, let tell you, star ordinary magnitude; he is Thicksides"--meaning Thucydides' class. "You will require end sky-climbing reach _his_ altitude. And now, victim, behold sacrificial priest," he said, placing Walter end table among thirty boys seated front master's desk large schoolroom, various parts forms also beginning work similar superintendence. When forms saying lessons time may imagined room still, master required good lungs teach talk hours. Not Mr Paton's form contributed much quota general noise. Although Henderson chaffed Daubeny his virtuous stillness, yet boys sat nearly quiet Dubbs school hours. Even Henderson mercurial spirits awed silence sobriety. You would hardly known quarter room _was_ form all. Quicksilver would lost volatility Mr Paton's manipulation. It hard first sight say was. Certainly Mr Paton set many punishments, masters, half his success. The secret Mr Paton something _routinier_, word which, he known it, Kenrick would used describe him. If he set imposition, imposition must done, must done certain time, without appeal, _causa indicta_. Mr Paton deaf Pluto excuses, inexorable Rhadamanthus his retributive dispensations. Neither Orpheus Amphion would moved him. Orpheus might made desks forms dance round listened his song, he could never got Mr Paton let fifty lines; Amphion would equally unsuccessful even walls court come petitioners obedience his strains. As remitting lesson, Mr Paton would done Saint Cecilia offered whole wreath red white roses admiring angels twined her golden hair. Mr Paton's rule leaden rule Lesbos [Aristophanes, Nic. Eth., v. 14.]; could bent suit diversities individual character, rule iron inflexible, applied equally all. His measure Procrustes; cleverest boys could stretch beyond it, dullest mechanically pulled dimensions. Hence fared hardly it; yet let hasten say that, whole, great number average boys, success. The discipline he established perfect, though many boys winced time, valuable them, especially idle sluggish tendency; rigid well severe, often learned look back upon gratitude respect. After time form went say lesson. Each boy put turn. When came Walter's turn Mr Paton first inquired his name, he entered extreme neatness his class-book--a book single blot first page last. He put he put rest. "I book, sir, did not know lesson was," said Walter. "Excuses, sir, excuses!" said Mr Paton sternly. "You mean have not learnt lesson." "Yes, sir." "A bad beginning, Evson; bring excuses future. You must write lesson out." And ominous entry implying fact written Walter's freshly-entered name. Most men would excused first punishment, contented word admonition; was not Mr Paton's way. He held Escalus that-- "Mercy oft looks so! Pardon still nurse second woe." [Measure Measure, act two, scene 1.] Now happened Walter hated excuses, always looked first cousins lies, he determined never render Mr Paton reason could possibility construed excuse. He therefore undergo large amount punishment, he flattered could possibility avoided. On occasion Henderson also turned, boy named Bliss. It quite impossible Henderson unemployed nonsense, heedless fact he Bliss's companion misfortune, he opened poetry-book, taking Lycidas his model, sat unusually still, he occupied composing "Lament Blissidas," beginning pathetically-- "Poor Blissidas turned; turned ere his prime Young Blissidas, hath left his peer; Who would weep Blissidas? He knew Himself say his Rep.--but give time-- He must quaff his glass watery beer Unchaffed, write, his paper ruled lined, Without meed melodious jeer." "I will lick you, Flip, school," said wrathful Bliss, shaking his fist, Henderson began whisper monody. "Why call Flip?" asked Walter laughing. "Short Flibberty-gibbet," said Bliss. "Bliss, Henderson, Evson, two hundred lines each," said Mr Paton; this, his first morning school, second punishment entered Walter's name. "Whew-w-w... abomination of... spoken by... hush!" Henderson's whispered comment. "I call hard lines." But he continued his "Lament Blissidas" notwithstanding, introducing Saint Winifred mourners Bliss's fate, ending admonition writing lines he was-- "To touch tender tops various quills, And mind dot his quaint enamelled i's." When Walter asked his tutor paper write his punishment, Mr Robertson said him, "Already, Evson!" tone displeasure, sarcasm hardly inferior Talleyrand's celebrated "Deja." "Two hundred lines lesson write _already_!" Bitter; sign sympathy, without one word inquiry, encouragement future, warning past; advice given, interest shown; wonder Walter never got his tutor. The days began Walter time days darkness disappointment. He deficient natural ability, he undergone special training Saint Winifred's School, consequently many things new boys previously trained. The practice learning grammar means Latin rules particularly trying him. He could easily mastered facts rules intended impress, empirical process suggested arriving facts he could remember, even he could construed crabbed Latin conveyed. His father, too, never greatly cultivated his powers memory, hence he felt serious difficulty first long lessons learnt heart. Mr Paton's system simply this. If boy failed lesson mundane whatever, he write out; he failed bring written out, he write twice; he turned second lesson he sent detention, _i.e._, he kept play hours; process long-continued he sent headmaster disgrace, ran chance flogged incorrigible idler. Mr Paton, devoted system, made allowance difference ability, idiosyncrasies temperament; he truly good man, bottom really kind-hearted man, genuine Christian; system he adopted his "idol cave," and, said before, _Kavwv molubdinos_ unknown him. Now, way system worked Walter this: he failed lessons new he found impossible master them. He accustomed work crowded noisy place great schoolroom, early hour going bed left little time evening work. Accordingly he often failed, whenever he did, impositions, detentions, both, took away his available time mastering his difficulties, necessitated fresh failures, every single punishment became frightfully accumulative, and, alas! three weeks over, Walter "sent bad" headmaster. By he felt degraded discouraged last degree. Moreover, harm done many ways. Conscious disgrace come upon without serious fault his own, even spite his direct strenuous efforts, he became oppressed sense injustice undeserved persecution. The apparent uselessness every attempt shake free trammels routine rendered desperate reckless, serious diminution his hours play exercise made dispirited out-of-sorts. And brought bitter fit homesickness, he often thought writing home imploring removed school, even taking his deliverance his hands, running away himself. But he knew his father mother already distressed beyond measure hear mill-round punishment discredit he fallen, he frankly informed them; sakes he determined bear-up little longer. Walter getting bad name idler, fast losing his self-respect. And sheet-anchor lost, anything may happen ship; however gay trim, however taut sides, however delicate beautiful curve prow, may drive gale, may dashed pitilessly among iron rocks, stranded hopelessly upon harbour bar. A little discipline, boy naturally noble-hearted capable, might transformed mere moon-calf, like poor Plumber, cruel vicious bully, like Harpour Jones. Happily young Walter saved influences losing his self-respect. He saved one two kindly genial friendships; success lines, happy consciousness his presence Saint Winifred's help comfort needed assistance sore need. One afternoon he sitting disconsolately bench ran along blank wall one side court, absolutely nothing. He disgusted world even take novel. It three of the clock, court deserted playground, match announced afternoon sixth-form school, (who never anything loaf about), either playing looking on. To sit his head bent down, bench empty court nothing game going on, unlike Walter Evson six weeks before; moment Walter weary detention, over; he burdened punishments, he half sick want exercise, he much spirits anything. Kenrick Henderson noticed lamented change him. Not exactly knowing causes his ill-success, astonished find apparently clever boy taking his place among sluggards dunces. With this, however, concerned less settled gloom falling him, rendered much less available wanted refresh talking little nonsense, amusing way. On day, guessing likely be, Kenrick proposed join game detention over, make Evson come play; Henderson kindly offered stay him, add his persuasions his friend's. As came ready dressed football, caught sight him. "Come along, old fellow; you are surely going fight school sixth," said Kenrick. "Is not late?" "No; anyone allowed quarter hour's grace." "Excuse number one bowled down," said Henderson. "But I am dressed; I shall not time put Jersey." "Never mind, you will want cap belt, play shirt-sleeves." "There goes excuse number two; cut along," said Henderson, "and get belt. We will wait here. Why, eternal friend's getting wasted misery daughter Babylon," said Henderson, Walter ran off. "Yes," said Kenrick. "I do not like see glum look instead merry face he came with. Never mind; game'll good; I never saw player; he looks like British lion he gets middle fray; plunges everything, shakes his mane. Here he is; come along." They ran found hotly-contested game swaying fro goals; Walter, active first-rate runner, soon thick it. As evenness match grew apparent players got excited. It already played several times, base kicked, except side, scale turned heavy wind. Hence exhibited greatest eagerness, school sixth alike held strong point honour win, shout approval greeted successful catch vigorous kick. Whenever ball driven beyond bounds, kicked straight in, generally short distance only, players sides struggled fell. During one momentary pauses Kenrick whispered Walter, "I say, Evson, next time it is driven outside I will try get it, you will stand beyond crowd I will kick you, try run." "Thanks," said Walter eagerly, "I will best." The opportunity soon occurred. Kenrick ran ball; glance showed Walter standing; he kicked precision, high, time rest watch likely descend. Walter caught it, others could recover surprise, like arrow. Of course, whole opposite side upon moment, he quick deer, wary cat. But his splendid running came in, he was, besides, rather fresher rest. He dodged, he made wide detours, he tripped sprang past others, he dived arms legs, he shook every touch, wrenched free one capturer leaving his hands whole shoulder his shirt, got nearer nearer goal. At last he saw one part field comparatively undefended; direction he darted like lightning--charged spilt, vehemence his impulse, two fellows stood outstretched arms stop him--seized favourable instant, swift clever drop-kick, sent ball flying bar amid deafening cheers, half side flung precipitated his body. The run brilliant plucky, last burst splendid, even defeated side could hardly forbear cheer him. As conquerors, enthusiasm knew bounds; shook Walter hand, patted back, clapped him, last lifted shoulders general inspection. As yet he known few, "Who is nice-looking little fellow got school base?" question heard every side. "That is Evson; Evson; Evson, new fellow," answered Kenrick, Henderson, knew him, fast could, reply general queries. They proud know then, little triumph occurred nick time raise poor Walter his estimation. "Thanks, Kenrick, thanks," he said, warmly grasping his friend's hand, left field. "They ought cheered _you_, me, had not I got base." "Pooh!" answer; "I could not got circumstances; even I could, least much pleasure _you_ done it." Of earthly spectacles beautiful, respects touching, friendship two boys, unalloyed taint selfishness, indiscriminating genuine enthusiasm, delicate natural reserve. It always hearts men wiser, purer, better hearts boys, "summae puerorum amicitia: saepe cum toga deponuntur." CHAPTER SIX. A BURST OF WILFULNESS. --Nunquamne reponam Vexatus toties? Juvenal i. i. Although Walter's football triumphs prevented losing self-respect sinking wretchlessness desperation, save his usual arrears punishment extra work. Besides this, annoyed bitterly always, spite effort, bottom, nearly bottom, his form. He knew grieved disappointed his parents nearly much himself, he feared would understand reason which, his case, rendered excusable--viz., enormous amount purely routine work boys prepared previous training, which, his present discouragements inconveniences, he felt impossible recover ground. It hard boys he knew superior every intellectual quality; hard boy really clever lively, set idler dunce. And made Walter miserable. For meanwhile Mr Paton taken quite wrong view his character. He answered well times, construed happily, showed bright flashes intelligence interest parts his work, Mr Paton, making allowances new methods untrained memory, set down, error judgment, able obstinate, capable excellently, wilfully refusing so. This phase character always excited his indignation; boy's sake he set correct it, possible. On sides, therefore, misunderstanding, consequent exacerbation mind told injuriously daily intercourse. Walter's vexation misery reached acme receipt his father his first school character, document his father sent back Walter's perusal, letter which, actually reproachful, least uneasy dissatisfied tone. For character Walter cared little, knowing well founded throughout misapprehension; his father's letter stirred depths his heart, made turbid passion sorrow. He received dinner-time, read he went across court detention-room, he frequent occupant. It bright September day, he longed game, among hills, shore. Instead that, he doomed his failures two long weary hours mechanical pen-driving, results torn two hours over. He exercise last week; his spare time taken impositions; Mr Robertson given severe angry lecture morning; even Mr Paton, rarely used strong language, called intolerable incorrigible, threatened second report headmaster, tenth successive Greek grammar lesson he failed. Added this, he suffering headache lassitude. And his father's letter cumulus his misfortunes. A rebellious, indignant, violent spirit rose him. Was he always, fault his own, bullied, baited, driven, misunderstood, crushed way? If use trying good, his duty, would try experiment--to fling trammels duty principle altogether; things inclination suggested moral sense forbade; enjoy himself; declare side pleasure self-indulgence? Certainly would save much unpleasantness annoyance many ways. He young, vigorous, active; he might easily make popular he boys; authorities, he would, appeared he could hardly worse disrepute now. Vice bade high: he thought all, his pen flew faster, his pulse seemed send blood bounding his veins he tightened grasp his left-hand round edge desk. Hitherto ideal he set him, standard attained his school-life, one successful devotion duty, real effort attain "godliness good learning," borne largest share. But morning different ideal rose him; he would abandon interest school work, aim gay, high-spirited boy, living solely pleasure, amusement, self-indulgence. There many around him--heroes among schoolfellows, popular, applauded, proud. Sin seemed sit lightly gracefully upon them. Endowed he every gift person appearance, condition least he felt he could easily attain. It ideal not, alas! unnatural perilous age: "Which claims manhood's vice privilege Of boyhood--when young Dionysius seems All joyous he burst upon East A jocund welcome conqueror; And Aphrodite, sweet sea She rose, floated her pearly she will A laughing girl; lawless erects Honour's gay temple Mount God, And meek obedience bears coward's brand; While Satan celestial panoply With Sin, his lady, smiling his side, Defies heaven arms." Yes; he would follow multitude evil he saw done around him; looked joyous delightful prospect. He gazed bright vision sin, iridescent waters pleasure; know brightness mirage burning desert, iridescence film corruption stagnant pool. The letter home his chief stumbling-block. He loved his father mother almost passionate devotion; he clung his home intensity concentrated love. He really tried please them, his best; yet did not seem give credit it. Look cold reproachful letter; maddened think it. There one thing checked him. It little voice, silent lately, passionate tones heard loudly; yet even child poor Walter accustomed listen reverence admonitions. It voice behind saying--"This way, walk ye it," he turning aside right-hand left. But noble accents whispered patience drowned clamorous turbulence voices appeal. The two hours detention over, struggle too. Walter drew his pen fierce angry scrawl lines he written, showed master attendance careless almost impudent air, hardly room he gave shout emancipation defiance. Impatience passion day. He ran playground hard he could tear work excitement his spirits, get rid inward turmoil. On grass bank far end he saw two boys seated, he knew Henderson Kenrick, who, wonder, reading, green novels, Shakespeare! "I will tell is, Henderson," he said; "I _can't_ I _won't_ stand longer. It is last detention breaks boy's back. I hate Saint Winifred's, I hate Dr Lane, I hate Robertson, I _hate, hate, hate_ Paton!" he said, stamping angrily. "Hooroop!" said Henderson; "so patient Evson fire last. Tell Dubbs." "Why, Walter, what is about?" asked Kenrick. "Why, Ken," said Walter, quietly, "here is history life: Greek grammar, lines, detention, caning--caning, detention, lines, Greek grammar. I am sick it; I _can't_ I _won't_ stand more." "Whether," spouted Henderson, volume his knee-- "`Whether 'twere nobler mind suffer The slings arrows outrageous fortune, Or take arms sea troubles. And opposing end them!'" "End I will," said Walter; "somehow, I will pay out, depend upon it." "Recte si possis si non quocunque modo," said Somers, head school, whose fag Walter was, who, passing moment, caught last sentence; "what excitement among small boys?" "The old story--pitching Paton," said Kenrick indifferently, rather contemptuously; he _protege_ Somers, felt annoyed he see Walter's unreasonable display, Somers asked already, "why he much idle new fellow always placed lag his form?" "What is about?" asked Somers Kenrick. "Because he gets lines missing his grammar, I suppose." There something tone especially offensive Walter; sounded Kenrick wanted show cold shoulder his _great_ friend, head school. "Oh, _that_ all? Well, dear fellow, remedy's easy; work little harder;" Somers walked on, humming tune. "I wonder he calls _harder_," said Walter, shaking his fist; "when I first came I used get quite early morning, learn till I half-stupid; I wonder whether he ever much?" "Well, it is good abusing Paton," said Kenrick; "of course, do not know lesson, he concludes have not learnt it." "Thank nothing, Kenrick," said Walter curtly; "come along, Flip." Kenrick vexed; he conscious shown little coolness want sympathy; he looked anxiously Henderson Walter walked away. Presently he started up, ran them. "Do not offended, Walter, boy," he said, seizing his hand. "I did not mean cold now; but, really, I do not see wrathful Paton; master one fails lesson two three times running? he must punish one, I suppose." "Hang Paton," said Walter, shaking his hand rather angrily, he thoroughly temper. "O, well, Evson," said Kenrick, whose chief fault intense pride, took fire least provocation, made take umbrage slightest offence; "catch making advance again. Henderson, left book grass;" turning his heel, he walked slowly away--heavy heart, he liked Walter better boy school, half ashamed break trifle. Henderson, apart his somewhat frivolous nonsensical tone, well-meaning fellow. When he walking Walter, he intended chaff his sudden burst ill-temper, jest away his spirit revenge; he saw poor Walter mood jokes, he quite lacked moral courage give good advice sober serious way, recommend course _because_ right. This, present, beyond Henderson's standard good, he left Walter went back his book. And Walter, flinging schoolroom, found several spirits seven times wicked himself, fed fire his wrath fuel unbounded abuse, mockery, scorn Mr Paton, he heartily abetted others, hailed indications Walter likely become one themselves. And evening, instead attempting get his work, Walter wasted whole time preparation noise, folly, turbulence; he duly punished master duty. He got next morning breathing, sense defiance enjoyment, his new atmosphere self-will. He, course, broke utterly, utterly ever, his morning lessons, got proportionately longer imposition. Going back his place, he purposely flung his books desk, one another bang; book he flung down, Mr Paton gave hundred lines, whereupon he laughed sarcastically, got two hundred more. Conscious boys watching amusement little exhibition temper trial wills, he took sheet paper, wrote it, large letters, words Two Hundred Lines Mr Paton, and, amid tittering form, carried Mr Paton's desk. This astoundingly impudent insubordinate act ever done Mr Paton years, his turn angry. But mastering his anger admirable determination, he merely said, "Evson, must beside morning; rarely, indeed, new boy far gone disobedience this. I hesitation saying audacious impertinent new boy I ever deal. I must cane room detention, course go." "Thank you, sir," said Walter, smile impudent _sang froid_; form tittered he walked noisily his seat. But Mr Paton, allowing his violent frame mind, took notice last affront. Whereupon Walter, taking another large piece paper, spluttering quill pen, wrote it, great deal scratching-- Due Evson Mr Paton. For missing lesson... 100 lines. For laying books... 300 lines. For laughing... 200 lines. For writing 200 lines... A caning. Detention, course. Thank nothing. And side sheet he wrote large letters--"No Go!" Which, done, he passed sheet along form _pour encourager les autres_. "Evson," said Mr Paton, quietly, "bring paper." Walter took up--looking rather alarmed time--but side "_No go_!" uppermost. "What this, Evson?" "Number ninety, sir," said Walter, amid unconcealed laughter rest, knew well he intended "No go." Mr Paton looked curiously Walter minute, said, "Evson, Evson, I could thought utterly foolish. Well, know fresh act _must_ fresh punishment. You must leave room now, _besides punishments_ I must also report headmaster. You best judge result." This mistake Mr Paton's--a mistake judgment only--for he cannot blamed. But disastrous mistake. Had he delicate judge reader phenomena character, he would observed moment wild spirit anger, rankling sense injustice persecution Walter's heart, amount punishment could cowed. Walter might without least difficulty goaded act violence would rendered expulsion school unavoidable consequence. So easy petrify will, make boy bad spite himself, spoil, intentions kindliness justice, promise fair young life. For suffered grow rigid obstinacy--a result easy avoid--no power earth bend _at time_. Had Mr Paton sent Walter room before; he end said, "Evson, to-day, I forgive you," Walter would moment docile humble child. But was, he left room quite coolly, sneer his lips, banged door; yet next moment, he found court alone, unsupported countenance enjoyed his rebelliousness, he seated bench courtyard, hung his head his breast, burst flood tears. If friend could seen moment, spoken one word season, much pain poor boy might saved! Kenrick happened cross court; moment Walter caught sight he sat head erect arms folded, Kenrick deceived. He caught one glimpse Walter first; he saw his eyes wet tears, knew he trouble. He hung his foot doubtfully one moment--but his pride came in; he remembered little pettish repulse playground day before; opportunity lost, he walked slowly on. And Walter's heart grew hard within stone. CHAPTER SEVEN. VOGUE LA GALERE. Ah! Diamond, thou little knowest mischief thou hast done. Life Sir I. Newton. That afternoon Mr Paton, going Combination Room, masters often met, threw one armchairs unwonted expression vexation disgust his usually placid features. "Why, what is matter you, Paton?" asked Mr Robertson. "Is to-day's _Times_ liberal notions, what?" "No," said Mr Paton; "but I caning Evson, new boy, fellow's stubborn obstinacy unaccountable coolness annoy exceedingly." "O yes; he is pupil mine, I am sorry say, he never free punishment since he came. Even Procrustean rule seems fail him, Paton. What obliged cane for?" Mr Paton related Walter's escapade. "Well, course choice cane him," replied his colleague, "for disobedience; he take it?" "In oddest way possible. He came punctilious politeness, obviously assumed, sarcastic intentions. When I took cane he stood arms folded, singularly dogged look; fact, his manner disarmed me. You know I detest caning, I really could it, never occasion months together. I gave two cuts, left off. `May I go, sir?' he asked. `Yes,' I said, he left room bow `Thank you, sir.' I really sorry boy; I obliged send Dr Lane, he probably get another flogging him." "What worthless boy he must be," answered Mr Robertson. "No, exactly worthless; there is something I cannot help liking; impudent stubborn." "Excuse me," said Mr Percival, another masters, listening attentively conversation; "I humbly venture think you are mistaken boy. I like exceedingly, think promising lad school. I never knew boy behave modestly respectfully." "Why, know anything him?" asked Mr Robertson surprise. "Only accident. I twice noticed among _detenus_, sorry think new boy _habitue_ extra schoolroom, I asked one day he sent. He told failing lesson, I asked he had not learnt it, he said, simply respectfully, `I really best, sir; it is new work me.' Look boy's innocent, engaging face, sure he telling truth. "I am afraid," continued Mr Percival, "you will think slight ground setting opinion yours; I pleased Evson's manner, asked come take stroll shore, I might know something him. Do know, I never found intelligent companion. He life vivacity; quite pleasure him. Being new sea, he did not know names commonest things shore, seen his face light he kept picking whelk's eggs, mermaid's purses, zoophytes, hermit-crabs, bits plocamium coralline, asking I could tell them, would thought stupid worthless boy." "I do not know, Percival; _you_ regular conjuror. All sorts never-do-wells succeed manipulation. You are first-rate hand gathering grapes thorns, figs thistles. Why, even Caliban, old Woods, used extract gleam human intelligence." "He was not Caliban all. I found excellent fellow heart; could expect boy who, he big, awkward, stupid, always getting flouted sides? Sir Hugh Evans person disliked made `vlouting-stog.'" "You must talisman transmuting boys consider old Woods excellent fellow, Percival. I found mass laziness brute strength. Do give secret." "Try little kindness sympathy. I secret." "I am conscious failing kindness," said Mr Robertson drily. "My fault, I think, kind." "To clever, promising, bright boys--yes; unthankful evil boys (excuse saying so)--no. You do not try descend dull level, understand difficulties. You do not suffer fools gladly, masters ought do. But, Paton," he said, turning conversation, seemed distasteful Mr Robertson, "will try succeeds lay yoke little less heavily Evson?" "Well, Percival, I do not think I have consciously bullied him. I cannot make system different boys." "My dear Paton, forgive saying I do not think rigid system fairest; _summa lex summa crux_. Fish different sorts sizes come nets, cannot shove turbot mesh barely admits sprat." "I will think say; I must leave Dr Lane's hands now," said Mr Paton. "Who, I heartily hope, will not flog him," said Mr Percival. "Why? I do not see he otherwise." "Because simply drive despair; because, I know anything his character, upon effect incalculably bad." "I hope not," said Mr Paton. The conversation dropped, Mr Percival resumed his newspaper. When Walter went Dr Lane evening, Doctor inquired kindly carefully nature his offence. This, unfortunately, clear enough, Walter far ingenuous attempt extenuation it. Even he intentionally idle, plain, his admission, he guilty greatest possible insubordination disrespect. These offences rare Saint Winifred's, especially rare new boy. Puzzled he conduct unlike boy's apparent character, interested his natural manly manner, yet Dr Lane case alternative infliction corporal punishment. Humiliated again, full bitter anger, Walter returned great schoolroom, he received sympathy kindness others his class. It dark part evening tea-time, boys, sitting idly round fire, apt mood folly mischief. They began vehement discussion Paton's demerits, called every hard name could invent. Walter took little part this, he smarting severely sense oppression find relief mere abuse; but, his flashing eyes dark scowl sat ill his face evident bad spirit obtained thorough mastery his better gentler impulses. "Cannot something serve fellow out?" said Anthony, one boys Walter's dormitory. "But _what_ do?" asked several. "What, indeed?" asked Henderson, mockingly; his way quote whatever he last reading, he began spout peroration speech he seen paper--"Aristocracy, throned citadel power, strong in--" "What fool are, Henderson," observed Franklin, another group; "I will tell do: we will burn horrid black book he enters detentions impositions." "Poor book!" said Henderson; "what pangs conscience suffer flames! Give glory martyrdom. Walter," he continued, lower voice, "I hope you will nothing humbug?" "I though, Henderson; I am nothing canings floggings, I may well caned flogged _something_ _nothing_." "The desk's locked," said Anthony; "we shall not able get hold imposition-book." "I will settle that," said Walter; "here, hand poker, Dubbs." "I shall thing," said Daubeny quietly, his reply greeted shout derision. "Why, poor coward, Dubbs," said Franklin, "you _couldn't_ get anything handing poker." "I never supposed I could, Franklin," he answered; "and coward, real cowardice would what is absurd wrong fear laughed kicked. Well, may hit me," he said quietly, Franklin twisted his arm tightly round, hit it, "but cannot make I do not choose." "We will try," said Franklin, twisting his arm still tightly, hitting harder. "You will try vain," answered Daubeny, though tears stood his eyes violent pain. "Drop his arm, Franklin," indignantly exclaimed Henderson, who, though he always teasing Daubeny, fond him; "drop his arm, or, Jove! you will find two play that. Dubbs quite right, you are set asses think you will good burning punishment book. I have got poker, shall not knock desk open. I suppose Paton afford sixpence buy another book; enter tolerable fresh score besides." "But he will not remember six hundred lines, four five detentions," said Walter. "Here, give poker." "Pooh! pooh! Evson, course he will remember them. Here, I will help lines; I will couple hundred you, rest write two pens time; will not take hour. I will show two-pen dodge; I will admit two-pen-etralia. Like Milton, shall `touch slender tops various quills.' No, no," he continued, playful tone order make Walter greater passion he was, "you cannot poker; anyone wants must take _vi et armis_." "It does not matter; this will well; goes," said Walter, seizing wooden stool. "There is desk open you," he said, he brought top stool strong blow lid, burst lock great crash. "My eyes! _shall_ get row," said Franklin, opening his eyes illustrate his exclamation. "Well, what is done's done; let us take share," said Anthony, diving his hand desk. "Here is imposition-book you, goes leaf number one fire; tear next like, Franklin." "Very well," said Franklin; "in penny pound; _goes_ second leaf." "And third; ankles knees," said Barton, another present. "Proverbial Fool-osophy," observed Henderson, contemptuously, Burton handed book. "Shall I silly sheep like rest you, leap bridge leader has? I suppose I must, though it is absurd." He wavered hesitated; sensible enough disapprove useless proceeding, he yet like thought afraid. He minded fellows would _think_. "Do what is right," said Daubeny, "and shame devil. Here, give book. Now, fellows, you have torn leaves, done quite mischief enough. Let put book back, do not like children hit fender they have knocked heads." "Or dogs bite stick they have thrashed with," said Henderson. "You are right, Dubbs, I respect you; ay, fellows may sneer like, I advised it, I will not make idiot do." "Never mind," drawled Howard Tracy. "I hate Paton, I will anything spite him," whereupon he snatched book Daubeny, threw entire flames. Poor Tracy even serious scrapes Mr Paton Walter had; his vain manner peculiarly abhorrent master, took every opportunity snubbing him; nothing would pierce thick cloak Tracy's conceit, fully satisfied himself, his good looks, his aristocratic connections, he sat contented ignorance, despised learning much least put invariably last his form. "What, nothing left burn?" said Walter, sat glowering high iron fender, swinging his legs impatiently. "Let us see else desk. Here pack old exercises, apparently; they will make jolly blaze. Stop, though, _are_ old exercises? Well, never mind; not, much better. In shall go." "Stop! _are_ doing, Walter?" said Henderson, catching arm; "you know cannot old exercises. Paton always puts _them_ his waste-paper basket, his desk. Oh, Walter, _have_ done?" "The outside sheets exercises anyhow," said Walter gloomily. "Here, it is good trying save now, whatever were" (for Henderson attempting rake bars); "they are done now," he pressed thick mass foolscap reddest centre fire, held nothing remained heap flaky crimson ashes. A dead silence followed, boys felt now, rate, "in it." The sound tea-bell prevented mischief; Henderson thrust his arm Walter's, he said, "Oh, Evson, I wish had not done that! I wish I would got come away before. What passionate fellow are!" "Well, it is done now," said Walter, already beginning soften, repent his fatuity. "What do?" said Henderson anxiously. "Take consequences, that is all," answered Walter. "Had not better go tell Paton instead letting find out?" "No," said Walter; "he is done nothing bully me, I do not care." "Then let go," said his friend earnestly. "I know Paton well; I am sure he would ready forgive you, I explained him." "You are good, Flip; do not go:--it is late." "Well, Walter, must not think I share afraid. I one group, I will share punishment you, whatever is. I hope sake will not found out." But Henderson seen little deeper he would hoped would found out, nothing works quicker ruin character undiscovered sin. It happy Walter his wrong impulses _not_ remain undiscovered; happy came rapidly known punished. It noised school five minutes Evson, one new fellows, smashed open Paton's desk burned contents. "What awful row he will get into!" general comment. Walter heard Kenrick inquiring eagerly sat tea; Kenrick did not ask _him_ it, though sat near other. After foolish, proud manner sensitive boys, Walter Kenrick, though liked none less, speaking terms. Walter, less morbidly proud Kenrick, would suffered silly alienation continue his attention occupied troubles. Neither them, therefore, liked first break ice, his serious difficulty Walter lost advice sympathy his intimate friend. The fellows seemed think he must inevitably expelled _fracas_. The poor boy's thoughts very, bitter he laid his head night his restless pillow, remembered ungovernable fool he been, dreamt his happy dear-loved home. How strangely he seemed left his old, innocent life behind him, little he would believed possible, two months ago, he could conduct his soon incurred, nearly incurred, penalty expulsion Saint Winifred's School. He certainly yielded quickly passion, he felt consequence he made his position serious boys every sense word twice bad himself. But he laid score his ill-luck truth happy providence punishment sent speedily heavily upon him, his evil tendencies, mercifully nipped bud, crushed tender yet iron hand expanded blossoms fed deeper roots. He might punished less speedily his faults radical, his wrong-doings deeper dye. CHAPTER EIGHT. THE BURNT MANUSCRIPT. All All poor scrapings, dozen years Of dust desk-work. Sea Dreams. It may supposed chapel next morning, he went early school, Walter agony almost unendurable suspense; suspense doomed prolonged time, last he could hardly sit still. Mr Paton notice his desk broken. He laid his books, went usual morning lesson. At length Tracy put on. He stood his usual self-satisfied way, looking admiringly his boots, running his delicate white hand his scented hair. Mr Paton watched somewhat contemptuous expression, though he thinking pity boy little puppy. Henderson, his usual quick discrimination, nicknamed Tracy "Lisping Hawthornbud." "Your fifth failure week, Tracy; must usual punishment," said Mr Paton, taking his key unlock desk. "Now it," thought form, looking great anxiety. The key caught hopelessly broken lock. Mr Paton's attention aroused; he pushed lid desk, saw broken open. "Who broken open desk?" No answer. He looked grave, said nothing, looking his imposition-book. "Where imposition-book?" No answer. "And my--?" Mr Paton stopped, looked greatest eagerness every corner desk. "Where manuscript I left imposition-book?" he said tone painful anxiety. "I hope trust," he said, turning pale, "that none wicked enough injure it," his voice faltered. "When I tell utmost value, I sure concealed taken it, give back once." There deep silence. "Once again," he asked, "where imposition-book?" "Burnt, sir; burnt, sir," said one two voices, hardly whisper. "And manuscript?" he asked, louder voice, still greater agitation. "Surely, surely, cannot thoughtless, incredibly unjust to--" Walter stood his place, his head bent, his face covered ashy whiteness. "I burnt it, sir," he said, almost inaudible voice, trembling fear. "Come here," said Mr Paton impetuously; "I cannot hear say. Now, then," he continued, Walter crept beside his desk. "I burnt it, sir," he said, whisper. "You--burnt--it!" said Mr Paton, starting uncontrollable emotion, changed burst anger he gave Walter box ear sounded room, made boy stagger back his place. But flash rage gone instant; next moment Mr Paton, afraid trusting longer, left his desk hurried out, anxious recover solitude calmness mind action terribly disturbed. Mr Percival, taught his form another part room, seeing Mr Paton box Walter violently ear, knowing reverse his usual method, since he never touched boy anger, walked see matter, Mr Paton, great hurried strides, reached door. "What matter Mr Paton?" he asked. There general murmur form, Mr Percival caught something Mr Paton's papers burnt. Anxious fend him, ask happened, Mr Percival, leaving room, caught sight pacing hasty uneven steps along private garden walk belonged masters. "I hope nothing unpleasant occurred," he said, overtaking him. "Oh, nothing, nothing," said Mr Paton, quivering lip, he turned aside. And then, suppressing his emotion powerful effort self-control, "It only," he said, "that hard results fifteen years' continuous labour condensed heap smut ashes schoolroom fire." "You do not mean say Hebrew manuscripts burnt?" asked Mr Percival amazement. "You know I toiling years, Percival; know I began I left college, I regarded chief work life, I devoted every moment leisure. You know, too, pride pleasure I took progress, relief I turned vexations anxieties one's life here. To work years recreation delight. Well, finished last; I correcting press; would gone printer month, I lived complete toilsome honourable task. Well, dream over, handful ashes represents struggle best years." Mr Percival knew well his coadjutor working years commentary Hebrew text Four Greater Prophets. It cherished chosen task his life; he brought great stores learning, accumulated vigour his powers, enthusiasm youthful ambition, he employed upon every spare hour left his professional duties. He looked means essential service church he ordained member, and, secondarily, road reputation well-merited advancement. And five minutes hand one angry boy robbed fruit his hopes. "If wanted display hatred I well know feel," said Mr Paton bitterly, "they might chosen way, literally _any way_, that. They might left me, least, almost pleasure object life, connection pursuits." And his face grew haggard he stopped his walk, tried realise extent he lost. "I would rather seen everything I possess whole world destroyed that," he said slowly, strong emotion. "And really Evson this?" asked Mr Percival, filled sincerest pity his colleague's wounded feelings. "It matters little it, Percival; but, yes, friend Evson." "The little, graceless, abominable wretch!" exclaimed Mr Percival anger, "he must expelled. But cannot recommence task?" "Recommence?" said Mr Paton, hard voice; "and give back hope vigour last fifteen years? shall I heart toil long trains research thought? hundreds references I sought verified hours heavy midnight labour? I access scores books I consulted I began work? The thought sickens me. Youth hope over. No, Percival, said. I robbed life's work. Leave me, please, alone little, I learnt say less bitterly, `God's done.'" "`He needeth Either man's work his gifts; best Bear his mild yoke please best,'" said Mr Percival, tone kind deep sympathy, he left return schoolroom. But sight Mr Paton's open rifled desk, Mr Percival's pent-up indignation burst forth clear flame. Stopping front Mr Paton's form, he exclaimed, voice rang scorn sorrow-- "You boys know immense mischief thoughtless worthless spite folly caused. I say `boys,' I believe, rejoice believe, one guilty, I rejoice too, _that_ one new boy, must brought feelings passions worthy ignorant ill-trained plough-boy Saint Winifred's scholar. The hand would burn valuable manuscript would fire rick hay." "O sir," said Henderson, starting interrupting him, "we nearly bad. It rest us burnt imposition-book; Evson nothing that." Henderson forgotten moment he least share burning imposition-book, his warm quick heart could bear blows fall unbroken his friend's head. But his generous effort failed; Mr Percival, barely noticing interruption, continued, "The imposition-book? I know nothing that. If burnt foolish reckless; deserve doubt punished it, _comparatively_ nothing. But know, bad boy," he said, turning Walter, "do know _you_ done? Do know dastardly spitefulness led destroy writings cost master years years toil cannot renewed? He treated unswerving impartiality; he never punished deserved punishment, he believed good, yet turn upon adder-like way; break open his desk like thief, and, one moment despicable ill-temper, rob world pursuit object his life. You, Evson, may well hide face"--for Walter bent desk, agonies shame remorse covered his face hands--"you may well ashamed look either honest manly right-minded boy among companions. You done wrong years hence part retribution remember nothing ever repair it, away effects. I disappointed you. You done mischief utmost working powers cannot years counterbalance, if, instead base idle appear be, devote whole heart work. I do not know done you; I, part, hope suffered remain us; but, are, I sure receive, richly deserve, reprobation contempt every boy among schoolfellows capable one spark honour right feeling." Every word Mr Percival said came poor Walter poignant force; master's reproaches pierced his heart let blood. He sat stirring, stunned crushed, though he beaten blows hammer. He quailed shuddered think great cruel injustice, base grievous injury his blind passion betrayed him, thought he could never hold his head again. Mr Percival's indignant expostulation passed culprits heard like thunderstorm. There force impetuosity gentleman's manner, his anger kindled, long gained among boys, he popular masters, half-complimentary soubriquet "Thunder-and-lightning." But none ever heard speak concentrated energy passion, except generous little Henderson awed silence. But Henderson moment wholly absorbed Walter's sorrows. "Tell him," said he Walter's ear, "tell mistake, thought papers old exercises. Dear Walter, tell he goes." But Walter still rested his white cheeks his hands upon desk, neither moved spoke. And Mr Percival, turning indignantly upon his heel, one last glance unmitigated contempt, walked his form. "Walter, do not take heart so," said Henderson, putting his arm round his neck; "you could not help it; made sad mistake, that is all. Go tell Paton so, I am sure he will forgive you." A slight quiver showed Walter heard. Henderson would liked see his anguish relieved burst tears; tears come, Walter move. At last hand touched him, he heard voice head boy say him, "Get up, Evson; I am take Dr Lane note Mr Percival." He rose followed mechanically, waiting headmaster's porch monitor went in. "Dr Lane will not see now," said Somers, coming again. "Croft," (addressing school Famulus), "Dr Lane says you are lock Mr Evson private room." Walter followed Famulus private room, little room top house, he knew boys locked previous expulsion, might opportunity mischief went. The Famulus left here, returned minutes dry bread milk, he placed deal table, which, wooden chair, constituted sole furniture room; he locked door, left Walter finally his reflections. Then flood flood passionate tears seemed remove iron cramp pained his heart. He flung floor, he thought irreparable cruelty he inflicted man severe indeed, never unkind him, apparent malignity heard would attribute he done, he sobbed sobbed though his heart would break. At one of the clock Famulus returned dinner. He found Walter sitting corner room, his head resting angle wall, his eyes red inflamed long crying. The morning's meal still lay untasted table. He looked round commiserating glance. "Come, come, Master Evson," he said, "you have call give way so, sir. If you have done wrong, wrong's done now, frettin' will not help it. There is as'll forgive you, make better next time, lad, knew it. Here, must eat dinner, Master Evson, leave cryin' so; cryin's comfort, sir." He stood waited Walter greatest kindness respect, till he seen swallow food, without difficulty, encouraging cheerful words left him, locked door. The weary afternoon wore on, Walter sat mournfully alone nothing miserable thoughts--miserable whatever subject he turned them, miserable longer he dwelt them. As shades evening drew he felt his head swimming, long solitude made feel afraid he wondered whether would leave night. And he heard light step approach door, gentle tap. He made answer, he thought he knew step, he could summon voice speak fit sobbing brought on. Then he heard boy stoop down, push note door. He took he heard footsteps die away, fast failing light able make out. It ran thus-- "Dear Walter,--You cannot think sorry, very, sorry I you. I wish I could take part punishment. Forgive cold proud you. I longing speak time, felt shy. It fault. I never break again. Good-bye, dear Walter, ever truly affectionate, Harry Kenrick." "He never break again," thought Walter. "If I am go to-morrow I am afraid he will never chance." And his saddest thoughts reverted home he left recently first time, he return nothing dishonour disgrace. At six of the clock kind-hearted Famulus brought lamp, tea, one two books, he heart read. No one allowed visit private room heavy penalties, Walter visitor eight, Somers, monitor taken Dr Lane, looked icily observed, "You are sleep sickroom, Evson; come me." "Am I expelled, Somers?" he faltered out. "I do not know," said Somers freezing tone; "you deserve be." True! oh lofty pitiless Somers. But could find say poor boy his distress? And _all_ deserts...? "At rate," Somers added, "I one will not fag longer, I should not think anyone else would either." With cutting remark he left Walter his reflections. CHAPTER NINE. PENITENCE. "If hearty sorrow Be sufficient ransom offence, I tender here; I truly suffer As ever I commit." Two Gentlemen Verona.--Act five, scene 4. Next morning Walter reconducted private room, there, kind dull pain head heart, awaited sentence decide his fate. His fancy left Saint Winifred's altogether; solely occupied Semlyn, dear society home. Walter rehearsing his mind scene his return; he say his father; he dry his mother's tears; he bear himself, his return, towards his little brothers sisters. Would he, expelled Saint Winifred's, ever able look anyone face home? While he brooding fancies, someone, breathless haste, ran his room, note thrust underneath door. He seized quickly, read-- "Dear Walter,--I glad first tell expelled. Paton begged off. No time more. I slipped away morning school leave news, cannot stay lest I caught. Good-bye, ever affectionate friend, "H.K." The boy's heart gave one bound joy he read this. If he expelled he ready bear meekly punishment appointed his offence. But his banishment school would deep affliction others besides himself, he dreaded feeling despair. Alone he little room, he fell his knees, heartily humbly thanked God answer his earnest, passionate, reiterated prayer; he read Kenrick's note again. "Paton begged off." He repeated sentence again, aloud himself, seemed he could never realise it. Paton--Paton, man he deeply irreparably injured--had begged off, shielded punishment one could considered severe his fault. Young inexperienced Walter Evson was, he could not, course, fully understand appreciate _amount_ loss, nature degree injury he inflicted; yet, he _could_ understand he done something caused greater pain his master even breaking limb, falling ill severe sickness. And he never prayed without praying also Mr Paton's misfortune might way alleviated; even, impossible prayer might seem, he, Walter, might share rendering endurable. It may seem strange Walter apparently excessive his self-condemnation. A generous mind usually is; Walter, may urged, never intended harm he done. If he mistook packet number exercises fault comparatively venial, comparatively--yes; though admitted break open private desk throw contents fire bad enough schoolboy circumstances, still would far less aggravated sin wilful infliction heavy damage spirit revenge. But lay gravamen Walter's fault; he knew--though he said so--in his inmost heart he _knew_ packet not, could not, consist merely old exercises, like outer sheets, put keep clean. When he threw fire thrust blazed away, he felt sure--and wicked moment indulged passion he rejoiced feel sure--that he consuming real value. Henderson's voice awoke moment his dormant conscience; then, however keen stings remorse, done could never undone. And "Paton begged off"! It wonderful him, he deeply grateful it, he knew that, Mr Paton's views, law punishment every offence law iron adamant--a law undeviating beneficial law gravitation itself. A slow hesitating footstep--the sound key turning door--a nervous hand resting handle--and Mr Paton stood him. In instant Walter his knees beside him, his head bent his clasped hands. "Oh, sir," he exclaimed, "please forgive me! I longing see you, sir, implore forgive me; forgiven I shall not mind anything else. Oh, sir, forgive me, can." "Do know, Evson, extent done?" said Mr Paton, constrained voice. "Oh, sir, indeed I do," he exclaimed, bursting tears. "Mr Percival said I destroyed years years hard work, I never, never, never make it, repair again. Oh, sir, indeed I did not know much mischief I doing; I wicked passion then, I would give right-hand done now. Oh, sir, ever forgive me?" he asked, tone pitiable despair. "Have asked God's forgiveness passionate revengeful spirit, Evson?" said constrained voice. "Oh, sir, I have, I know God forgiven me. Indeed I never knew, I never thought before, I could grow wicked day. Oh, sir, shall I gain forgiveness; I would anything, sir," he said, voice thick sobs; "and forgave me, I could almost happy." All Walter dared look Mr Paton's face. Abashed he was, he could bear meet look he expected find there, old cold unpitying look condemnation reproach. Even moment he could help thinking Mr Paton understood better, he would seemed utterly bad he must seem, recent act sin folly bear witness him. He dared look his eyes swimming tears; he expected kind gentle touch trembling hand rested his head though blessed him, smoothed his dark hair, wiped big drops away his cheeks. He expected arm raised his kneeling position, fingers pushed back his hair his forehead, gently bent back his head; pitying eyes, dim, though well compassion--that looked sorrowfully, yet kindly, his own. He could bear this. If Mr Paton struck him, he first moment overwhelming anger; he spurned away, ordered amount punishment, would far easier bear Christian gentleness; ready burying pity oblivion heaviest undeserved calamity master ever undergone hands man. Walter could bear it; he flung his knees passion weeping, clasped Mr Paton's knees, uttering broken sentences, "I never make it, never repair long I live." For moment kind hand rested boy's head, gently smoothed his dark hair; Mr Paton found voice speak, lifting up, seating upon his knee, said him-- "I forgive you, Walter, forgive freely gladly. It hard, I own, first so, I disguise loss bitter thing bear. I sleepless, never able banish distress mind caused since occurred. And yet loss I shall _not_ feel fully once, many long day I sit again, God gives strength so, recover lost stores rearrange interrupted thoughts. But I, too, learnt lesson, Walter; reached age, boy, too, I trust, learnt control evil passions strong will, bear meekly patiently _whatever_ God sends. And too, Walter, learn lesson. You said would give anything, anything, undo wrong, repair it; nothing, child, give nothing, cannot undone. Wrong rarely mended. Let helplessness teach truth may remain life. Let check wilful impetuous moments; done remains irrevocable. You may rue years years work days moments, may _never_ able avoid consequences, even deed forgotten generous forgiven just." And kindly, gently, quietly spoken; every word sank Walter's heart never forgotten, his tears flowed still quiet sadness now. "Yes, Walter, occurrence," continued Mr Paton calm, low voice, "may us good, miserable is. I say now, I quite forgiven it. Man far mean creature justified withholding forgiveness personal wrong. It far hard forgive one's-self one done wrong. I determined bury whole matter oblivion, inflict punishment either boys concerned folly sin. I forgive halves. But, Walter, I wrong doubting time forward advance marked improvement. You something bear, doubt, let weigh heavily; me, I try henceforth friend." What could Walter seize his hand clasp earnestly, sob broken incoherent thanks eloquent connected words. "And now, Walter, free," said Mr Paton. "From _us_ hear offence. It nearly dinner-time. Come; I walk hall." He laid his hand boy's shoulder, walked downstairs across court. Walter deeply grateful he so, he heard rumours scorn indignation news his conduct received elder influential portions school. He dreaded unspeakably first occasion would necessary meet again, he felt Mr Paton's countenance kindness paved way him, smoothed his formidable trial. It beyond his warmest hopes he able face so. He never dared expect open proof, person suffered chiefly act would also first show he cast helpless worthless, ready receive favour again. The corridor full boys waiting dinner bell, divided respectfully leave passage Mr Paton, touched hats he passed his hand still Walter's shoulder, Walter walked downcast eyes beside him, daring look up. And boy passed them, humbled penitent, Mr Paton's hand resting upon him, one saw learn sight lesson calm forgiveness noble forcible lesson could learn Saint Winifred's School. Walter sat dinner pale crying, unpitied. "Alas rarity Christian charity sun!"--the worst construction assiduously put upon he done, nearly boys hastily condemned it, ungentlemanly, also inexcusable unpardonable act. One another, passed dinner, cut dead. Several masters, including Mr Percival, Walter hitherto loved respected them, he treated marked kindness, same. Walter met Mr Percival playground touched his cap; Mr Percival glanced contemptuously moment, turned his head aside without noticing salute. It may seem strange, must remember hear wrong act report only, presents mere naked fact--a bare result without preface palliation. The subtle grades temptation led it--the violent outburst passion long pent-up thus found consummation--are unknown forgotten, deed itself, isolated rendered possible, receives unmitigated condemnation. All anyone took trouble know believe Walter's scrape was, he broken open master's private desk, revenge purposely burnt valuable manuscript; this, sentence passed upon broadly gross. Poor Walter! dark days him; Henderson Kenrick stuck fast him, little Arthur Eden still looked unbounded gratitude affection, he felt case hopeless. Kenrick, indeed, seemed waver twice. He sought Walter shook hands once, still he him, Walter fancied, much he might been, till, short struggle, his natural impulse generosity day. As Henderson, Walter thought he could died him, much he loved his kindness hour need; Eden never left his side he could creep console merry playfulness, his companion he would otherwise alone. The boys truly sorry hear Mr Paton's loss; roused generous feelings. That evening came chapel gathered round iron gates. The intention groan poor Walter. He knew perfectly well, Henderson prepared it, expressed his determination walk his side. It moment keen anguish, anguish betrayed his scared agitated look. But he spared last drop cup punishment. The mere sight showed boys he suffered bitterly enough already. When looked heart hurt shame more. Mr Paton's open forgiveness fallen severely changed current feelings. Instead groaning Walter let pass by, waited till Mr Paton came chapel door, he walked across court boys followed hearty cheers. Mr Paton like demonstration, although he appreciated kindly honourable motives given rise it. He man courted popularity, external sign was, he well knew, irregular expression evanescent feeling. So he took notice boys' cheers slightly raising his cap, one stately inclination head, he walked his usual quiet dignity manner his rooms. But he every took opportunity walk Walter; almost every Sunday evening he might seen pacing, morning chapel, broad walk masters' garden, Walter walked unevenly beside him, vain endeavours keep step his long slow stride. A letter Dr Lane brought Walter's father Saint Winifred's next day. Why dwell sad painful meeting? But pain soon wore interchanged sweet frank communion thoughts sympathies still existed ever done them. They long, long walk upon shore, every step Walter seemed in-breathe fresh strength, hope, consolation, Mr Evson seemed acquire new love for, confidence in, his unhappy little son, evening he kissed said "good-bye," top hill parted before, Mr Evson felt happily gratefully secure his radical integrity, boy acquired strength comes trial, failure, suffering, he done he left strength early principle untested innocence heart. But long years after, Walter man, he separated years intelligence Mr Paton, emanated quiet country vicarage celebrated edition "Major Prophets," edition made author high reputation, secured following year Deanery --. And preface edition reader may still find following passage, which, Walter saw even then, long years after, he could read without thrill happy, yet penitent emotion. It ran thus-- "This edition `Major Prophets' chosen work author's leisure, he almost afraid say many best years his life spent upon it. A strange fortune happened it. Years ago finished, written out, ready press. At time burnt--no matter circumstances--by boy's hand. At first, author never hoped courage power resume finish task again. But pleased God, Who sent trial, provide also leisure, opportunity, resolution, old misfortune last repaired. It sake one person, one person only, private matters intruded reader's notice; person, his eye ever fall lines, know also word `repaired' printed larger letters. And I would also tell kindness, pleased God bring rash act his boyhood nothing good. The following commentary is, I humbly trust, far worthy high subject, received maturer consideration advancing years, would seen light Saint Winifred's long ago. I write sake boy wept seemed _irreparable_ fault; I add thankfully, never moment I retracted forgiveness; I think his efforts kindliness affection; he has, always have, best prayers his interest welfare. "H. Paton." CHAPTER TEN. UPHILLWARDS. "But Conscience makes firm. The boon companion, her strong breastplate Buckles feels guilt within, And bids fear not." Dante, c. xxviii. "Qui s'excuse s'accuse." "If character cannot defend itself, it is worth defending." "No one ever written down, except himself." These, proverbs like these, express common almost instinctive feeling, self-defence calumny generally unsuccessful, almost always involves loss dignity. Partly because, partly penitence his real errors, partly scorn malice misrepresented him, Pharisaism far worse offenders held aloof his misfortune, Walter said nothing exculpate his conduct, shield silent indignation, half real half affected, weighed heavily him. The usual consequences followed; story his misdoing repeated believed least mitigated form, version gained credence currency uncontradicted. The school society bound his sin upon him; retained it, retained. It burdened his conscience galling weight, his fellows remained long unforgiven. At best, days fiery trial overcharged young heart. He lost immediate influence, he looked forward vista his school-life, he feared he never entirely regain it. Even he time become monitor, he felt half his authority must lost stigma branded deeply his name. Yet beautiful sight see bravely manfully young boy set re-establish reputation he destroyed, since he could "build upon _foundations_ yesterday," build upon _ruins_; see touching humility he accepted undeserved scorn, touching gratitude he hailed scantiest kindness; see he bore unflinchingly every difficulty, accepted his hard position among unsympathising schoolfellows, made it, without anger without complaint. He could see years days time unmitigated blessing. They taught lessons manliness, endurance, humility. The necessity repairing error recovering failure became powerful stimulus hope avoiding altogether. The hour punishment, bitter absinthe his taste, became sweet honey his memory. Above all, days taught him, manner never forgotten, invaluable lesson sense done ill deed heaviest calamity ill deed ensures, life single secret happiness comparable certain blessing brought conscience void offence. Perhaps strain would great his youthful spirits, might left his character impress permanent melancholy, derived thus perpetually reminded he gone wrong, school sermon Mr Paton preached time, Walter felt meant part him. It danger unwisdom brooding continually over; preached upon text, "I restore years locust hath eaten, canker-worm, caterpillar, palmerworm, great army." "The past past," said preacher; "its sins sorrows irrevocably over; dwell upon now? Do waste present, opportunities, hopeless helpless retrospect. The worst us need despair, much less may betrayed sudden error moment unguarded passion. There lies future you; onwards then, forwards! yet innocent, may happy, future. Take prayerful thankfulness, fling withered part aside. Thus, although thus only, recover neglected opportunities. Do hope meekness, God make lost past; He Who inhabiteth eternity stretch forth His eternity forgiving hand, touch green leaf years locust hath eaten." How eagerly Walter Evson drank words! That day least he felt man doth live bread alone, every word proceedeth mouth God. If Walter old enough observer character, he might gathered his difficulties materials curious observation manner he treated different boys. Many, like Harpour Cradock, made, course, sort difference behaviour towards him, set pretence condemnation; others, like Anthony Franklin, nearly bad matter, therefore relations remained quite unaltered. But many boys who, like Jones, either cut cold him, really felt moral anger fault much less heinous reality many daily committed, he was, time, unpopular, care seen unpopular boy. On hand, feeling, time could understand, best boys, wisest, steadiest, noblest, seemed drawn new tie; short time he began know friends among whose way he might otherwise thrown. Daubeny, instance, whom, although boys chose make something butt, conscientious fellow Saint Winifred's, sought Walter every possible occasion, alone spoke him, his gentle honest way, many cheering kindly word. Another friend sort (whom Walter already knew slightly Kenrick, form him), boy named Power. There something Power attractive: his clear eyes, innocent expression face, his unvarying success school competitions, his quiet graceful manners, even coldness reserve made stand somewhat aloof herd boys, mixing them, firmly unobtrusively assuming altogether higher tone theirs, bestowing his confidence friendship hardly any--all tended make marked character, confer his intimacy unusual value. Walter, yet he hardly spoken, thought self-centred reserved, yet saw something beautiful fascinating even his exclusiveness; he felt he could liked much, but, he several forms lower Power, never expected become one his associates. But his troubles Power openly showed he regarded respect kindness, clearly first make advances, Walter gladly gratefully accepted proffered friendship. It happened thus: One day, fortnight his last escapade, Walter amusing alone, he often did, upon shore. The shore dear him. I almost pity boy whose school seaside. He found shore companionship occupation. He never felt lonely there. He could sit hour, either calm storm, watching sea-birds dip wings flashed sunlight, pounced unwary fish; listening silken rustle sweet monotony waves plashing musically upon yellow sands fine day. On evening tide coming in, Walter amused standing lumps granite tossed shore advancing waves encroached upon surrounded his little island, gave room jump land. He standing one great stones watching sunset, laughing odd gambols two three porpoises kept rolling futile manner across little bay, he heard pleasant voice say him-- "I say, Evson, going practise old style martyrdom--tie stake let tide gradually drown you?" Looking round he surprised see Power standing alone sands, see also his little island far surrounded he could get shore without wet knees. "Hallo!" he said; "I see I must take shoes stockings, wade." But slippery piece rock upon he standing he room without losing his balance tumbling over; Power moment taken his shoes stockings, turned his trousers knees, waded him. "Now," he said, "get back, I will carry unwetted." "Thanks, Power," he said, Power deposited sand; "I am much obliged." Not knowing whether Power would like seen not, he looked shyly, walking another direction, Power, putting his stockings again, said playfully-- "What, Walter; have not grace wait me, delivered noyade? Excuse calling Walter; I hear Kenrick Henderson it, somehow you are one fellows one meets then, whose Christian name seems suit naturally other." "By means call Walter, Power; I will wait gladly like," said Walter, blushing he added, "I thought might like walk me." "Not like? Nonsense. I like particularly. Let us take turn along shore; shall time roll-call." Walter pointed droll porpoises absorbed his attention, stood looking laughing them, Henderson came unobserved, patting Walter back, observed poetically-- "Why young hearts sad, oh beautiful children morning? Why young eyes gaze timidly sea?" "Where _did_ crib quotation from, Flip," asked Power laughing; "your mind's like shallow brook, colour always shows stratum flowing last." "Shallow brook, quotha?" said Henderson; "a deep mighty river, sir, mean; irresistible Power." "Oh, _do_ shut up. Why I born name could punned on? No puns, Flip, love me," said Power; three walked noble Norman archway formed entrance school. "By powers," said Henderson Walter, left them, "you _have_ got new friend worth having, Walter. _He_ does not make home every one, I tell you; he Dubbs cultivate you, I think it is time anyone else ashamed cutting you, boy." "I am quite happy now," said Walter; "with Kenrick friends. I do not care much rest. I wonder he likes me?" "Well, he thinks fellows great deal hard one thing. How good patient you have been, Walter, all." "It hard sometimes, Flip, I deserve it. Only I am afraid Ken get quite tired me, I have speak to. Harpour lot would glad enough I join them, I know, Ken I driven it." "Never mind, Walter, boy; fellows'll come round time." So, step step, countenance true worthy friends, help stout uncorrupted heart, penitence kindliness, brave little Walter win his way. He helped, too, greatly, his achievements games. At football he played vigour earnestness carried everything it. He got several bases, youngest boy school ever succeeded this. Gradually surely his temporary unpopularity gave way; even he began generally recognised again, he bade fair _ultimately_ gain high position estimation his schoolfellows. There one scene he long remembered, trying go through. One fine afternoon boys' prize highest jump awarded, school greatly interested competition, assembled dense circle green playground, leaving space jumpers middle. The fine weather also tempted nearly inhabitants Saint Winifred's spectators contest, numbers ladies present, boys politely left space within circle. When chief jumping prize active fellow sixth-form, another prize proposed boys fifteen. Bliss, Franklin, two boys stepped circle competitors, threw jackets. "You must go this, Walter," said Henderson. "You are sure get it." "Not I. I will not go in, Flip," said Walter, naturally desponding mood, he looked round four hundred faces, saw among scarcely one sympathising glance. "_You_ go win. And never mind talking here, Henderson; cannot pleasant you, I know, fellows cutting me." "Pooh! Walter. _They're_ wrong box; I. `Athanasius contra mundum,' Power says. Do go prize." Walter shook his head gloomily. "I do not like to, fellows. They would hiss something." "Well, _you_ will not, _I_ will not; that is flat." "O do, Henderson. I am sure you would get it. Do not ask go in, that is good fellow." "None four going little jump? What, four?" said one young athletes, carried little blue flags, arranged preliminaries. "Come you." "Here two more," said Henderson; "stick names--Henderson Evson"; pulling Walter forward inside circle, he sat began take his shoes, he might run jump easily turf. Thus prominently mentioned, Walter could hardly draw back, putting best face he could, he, too, flung his jacket shoes. The movable spar wood boys jumped first put height three feet, could easily manage, six, one another, cleared lightly. Even then, however, pretty easy judge action best jumper, connoisseurs field decided chance lay Henderson Walter; Walter far active graceful jumper, Henderson advantage little taller two. The spar raised half inch time, attained height three feet half, two candidates failed clear three trials. Bliss next break down. His awkward jumps excited great deal laughter, he finally failed, Henderson found time even begin line two his monody Blissidas, standing joke poor Bliss, always met invariable observation "I will lick afterwards, Flip." Only three competitors left--Franklin, Henderson, Walter-- jumped steadily till reached height four feet one inch, Franklin broke down, recovered second chance. The struggle became exciting, Franklin Henderson cleared bar height four feet four, loudly clapped. But Walter--who jumped last always, he last candidate come forward--although he cleared easy bound, received sign encouragement boys. He cleared perfect silence, broken Mr Paton, looking group masters, said encouragingly, "Very well done, Evson; capital!" The bar raised inch, three boys cleared it, first two greeted applause, Walter left unnoticed except Power Kenrick, applauded heartily, patted back. But indeed clapping served throw stronger relief loud applause others received. Walter almost wished would desist. He greatly agitated; his friends saw he trembling emotion. He much mortified first time thus pointedly scorned large crowd strangers, made marked object reprobation all; open shame thus _steadily_ _continuously_ put upon him, made his heart swell sorrow indignation ungenerous unforgiving spirit his schoolfellows. Once bar raised inch. The two got amid burst applause, time Walter, unnerved painful circumstances he found himself, brushed he came over, knocked off. The bar replaced, his second trial (for three allowed) he jumped well he flew easily it. Always before, boy recovered failure saluted double cheering, Walter's proceedings observed large crowd dead silence, he could help overhearing whispered queries asked explanation unusual circumstance. "Why do not cheer well others?" asked fair young girl her brother. "He looks nice boy." "Because he shabby thing long ago," reply. He could stand longer. He glanced round speakers sorrow anger, then, instead returning starting-point, he turned hastily aside, and, declining contest, plunged thickest crowd. "Evson's giving up. What pity!" said several boys. "No wonder he is giving up," said Power indignantly, "after way fellows treat him. Never mind them, Walter," he said, taking arm; "they ashamed by." "You are going withdraw, Evson?" asked one chief athletes, kind tone. "Yes," said Walter, retiring still farther hide amid crowd. "Nonsense!" said Henderson, heard answer; "come, Walter, it will spoil fun do not go on." "I cannot, Flip," said Walter, turning aside, hastily brushing away tears _would_ come his eyes. "Do, Walter, wish it," whispered Henderson; "be brave, get prize spite all; here is Paton coming round; I am sure it is cheer up." "Very well, Flip, I will, pleases you; it is rather hard," he said, fairly bursting tears. "Remember, it is sake I it, Flip." "Go on, Walter; do not give way," said Mr Paton aloud, his gentlest encouraging voice, boy hastily re-entered arena, took his place. This time Franklin finally broke down, Henderson barely scrambled over, Walter, nerved excitement indignation, cleared bar brilliant flying leap. There mistake applause time. The boys seen coolness told him. They touched pluck he showed spite his dejected look, though make former deficiency, clapped loud either others. And spirited contest began Henderson Walter. Four feet six half accomplished--Walter first time, Henderson third. When Henderson, his last trial, barely succeeded, loud shout rose field, quite enthusiastic enough show wishes school his side. This decided Walter, he anxious Henderson, set his heart upon prize, quite eager emulation, successful competitor. At four feet seven, therefore, he meant break down, but, time, clear bar nearly time trial, might _obvious_ one he putting forth his best strength. The first time, however, he jumped carelessly Henderson suspected his purpose, and, therefore, second time he exerted little more, and, his astonishment, accomplished leap without intended so. Henderson also succeeded managing it, Walter refused try another half inch, prize declared, amid loud cheers, equally divided them, best competition ever known. The boys spectators moved pavilion, prizes distributed Mrs Lane. But Walter's name called Henderson's, latter stepped forward. Walter disappeared; boys made feel, his voluntary absence, bitterness heart unkind conduct caused him. Henderson took prize his friend, he received his own. The prizes silver-mounted riding-whip, belt silver clasp, Mrs Lane told Henderson she sorry victor's absence, either might choose whichever prize he liked best. When crowd dispersed Henderson, knowing Walter's haunts, strolled Kenrick little fir-grove slope Bardlyn Hill, far sea. Here, expected, found Walter. He sitting listless attitude, his back towards them, he started he heard footsteps. "You let beaten, Evson Walter, And afterwards proved base defaulter," said Henderson, high spirits, he clapped his hands Walter's shoulders, continued-- "Behold I bring silver prizes, Meant reward _feets_ exercises." Even Walter could help smiling sally, he said once, "You must keep prizes, Flip; I do not mean take either--indeed I will not; I should not gone you." "Oh, take one," said Kenrick; "the fellows think proud do not." "I do not care think me, Ken; saw treated me. Flip, I would take prize minute please you, but, indeed, would remind constantly odious jumping, I would much rather not." "I cannot take _both_ prizes, Walter," said Henderson. "Well, I will tell what--give one Franklin; he jumped well, he is half bad fellow. Do not press me, Flip; I cannot refuse anything do, you have very, kind; do not know wretched I feel." Henderson, looked annoyed, cleared moment. "All right, Walter; shall like. Franklin shall it. You have quite enough bear already. So cheer up, come along." It soon known school Walter yielded prize Franklin, known, too, next day he gone jump Henderson, Franklin, others, cleared bar four feet eight, none able do. The boys admired his conduct throughout; day forward many anxious renew acquaintance previously break off. And early opportunity testing this; days scene described champion race boys fifteen tried for, Walter accomplishing distance shortest time yet known, distancing runners, he received cheer, hearty boys anxious tardy justice. If Walter noble merely patronised, reserved "hail-fellow-well-met" every one, he would fallen easily speedily position he slowly honourably recovered. It need hardly said that, his school work, Walter struggled his might give satisfaction Mr Paton, spare pain. There something really admirable way he worked, taxed even beyond his strength, prove his regret Mr Paton's loss, required him. Naturally quick lively he was, he sat quiet attentive school, he gifted disposition unmercurial Daubeny himself. In order make sure his lessons, he went Henderson (who entered eagerly his wishes) care, they, them, astonished improving progress. If came insuperable difficulties, Kenrick Power gladly helped them, explained everything sympathetic clearness instruction makes one boy best teacher another. The main difficulty still continued repetition, grammar rules; order know them, least rote, Walter would get earliest gleam daylight, would put his trousers waistcoat bed-time, go sit, book hand, gaslight passage. This hard work, doubtless; brought reward successful endeavour approving conscience. Under discipline his memory rapidly grew retentive; difficulty stand assaults batteries these, Walter soon free punishments, happy day long. One little cloud alone remained--the continued obvious displeasure his tutor, one two Mr Paton's chief friends among masters. One Mr Edwards, who, among duties, management chapel choir. But length Mr Edwards gave distinguished proof his returning respect. He sat near Walter chapel, hymn happened one came closely home Walter's heart his recent troubles. This made join great feeling singing, choirmaster struck strength rare sweetness his voice. As he left chapel, Mr Edwards said him, "Evson, vacancy treble choir; I heard sing chapel to-day, I think would supply place well. Should like join?" Walter gladly accepted offer, partly he hailed opportunity learning little music, choir boys allowed several highly-valued exceptional privileges; chiefly always chosen masters express reference character, therefore invitation join number clearest proof could given past condoned. The last offer right-hand forgiveness, best warmest friend he done so, Mr Percival. He still passed coldest distant recognition, he felt Mr Paton's loss peculiar sorrow, also vexed disappointed boy whose character he openly defended proved unworthy his encomium. It happened _only_ time Walter ever sent detention failure long lesson, including much learnt morning he school, which, consequence, he found impossible, his efforts, master. Mr Paton saw mortified pained he fail, he sent detention, kindly called up, told he saw his unsuccess, _in least_ displeased it, although, he similarly punished boys, he could make exception usual rule punishment. On occasion, Mr Percival's turn sit _detenus_, seeing Walter among them, he hastily concluded he still continuing career disgrace. "What! again?" he said chilling scorn, he passed seat Walter sat writing. "After happened, I ashamed sent here, I you." After his days nights toil, his long, manly, noble struggle show his penitence, his heavy disproportionate punishment, hard addressed one he respected, presence idlest school, consequence purely accidental isolated failure. Walter looked appealing look his dark blue eyes; Mr Percival passed on, he bent his head his paper old sense past could _never_ forgotten, recollection his disgrace _never_ obliterated. No one observing him; feeling despair grew him, large tear dropped upon his paper; he wiped quietly away, continued writing, another another fell, he could help it. For Mr Percival almost master whose goodwill he strongly coveted, whose approval he anxious attain. When next Mr Percival stopped looked Walter, he saw his words wounded heart, knew well boy's lines blurred blotted, he showed timid hand downcast look. He touched. "I hard you, Evson," he said; "I see now. Come tea chapel evening; I want speak you." CHAPTER ELEVEN. HAPPIER HOURS. "Sir, one serve God devil bid you." Othello, act 1, scene 1. When chapel over, Walter, brushed his hair, made rather neater spruce schoolboy usually middle long half, went Mr Percival's room. Mr Percival, detained, yet come in; Henderson, Kenrick, Power, also asked tea, waiting Walter arrived, Henderson, usual, amusing others flood mimicry nonsense. "You know mischievous little Penkridge," said Kenrick; "he nearly accident morning. We classroom, Edwards complaining bad smell room--" "Bad smell!" interrupted Henderson, "I will bet like Edwards did not say bad smell. _He's_ man call spade spade; he calls agricultural implement trituration soil." "Why, _should_ he say?" asked Kenrick, "if he did not say `bad smell'?" "Why, `What malodorous effluvium!'" said Henderson, imitating exactly master's somewhat drawling tone; "`what con-cen-trra-ted malarious miasma; unendurable'--I say Power, give us Greek, Hebrew, Kamschatkan, `smell.'" "Odwde," suggested Power. "That is T," said Henderson; "I bet he observed, `What un-en-duu-rrable osus.' Now, did not he? Confess truth." "Well, I believe he say something kind," said Kenrick, laughing; "at least I know he called Stygian Tartarean. But, I saying, he set Penkridge (who happened going round lists) examine cupboards, see chance inopportune rat died there; Penkridge, opening one floor rotten, poking his foot, knocked great piece plaster great schoolroom ceiling, nearly possible putting his foot it." "Fancy he had," said Walter, "how astonished below. I say, Henderson, _would_ Paton said?" "Oh! Paton," said Henderson, delighted opportunity mimicry, "he would whispered quietly, emotionless voice, `Penkridge, Penkridge, come here--come here, Penkridge. This unusual method, Penkridge, entering room--highly irregular. If have not broken leg arm, Penkridge, must write two hundred lines.'" "And Robertson?" asked Kenrick. "Oh! Robertson--he would put his eye-glass," said Henderson, exactly hitting master's attitude, "and he would observed, `Ah! Penkridge fallen floor; probably fractured bones. Slippery fellow, he will not able go Fighting Cocks _this_ afternoon, rate.' Whereupon Stevens would gone utmost tenderness, asked he hurt; Penkridge, getting up, would, way gratitude, grinned his face." "Well, you would better finish scene," said Power; "what would Percival said?" "Thunder-and-lightning? Oh! that is easy decide; he would made two three quotations; he would immediately called attention form fact Penkridge been:-- "`Flung angry Jove Sheer crystal battlements; morn Till noon he fell, noon till dewy eve; A winter's day, tea-bell rang, Shot ceiling like falling star On great schoolroom floor.'" "Would he, indeed?" said Mr Percival, pinching Henderson's ear, he came time join laugh parody occasioned. Tea Saint Winifred's regular recognised institution. There nights boys adjourn chapel tea masters' houses, privilege sitting hour half later. The masters generally adopt method seeing pupils boys interested. The institution works admirably; first immediate result is, boys masters intimately acquainted, so, warmer friendlier terms perhaps school--certainly warmer terms never met except still punishment-pervaded atmosphere schoolrooms; second remoter result is, matter work already alluded to, also equally important particulars, tone character Saint Winifred's boys higher purer would otherwise be. There simplicity manliness cannot fail bring forth rich fruits diligence, truthfulness, honour. Many boys come thence, who, sweet yet sober dignity life demeanour, go far realise beautiful ideal Christian boyhood. Many boys walking, gates humility diligence, certain, merited, conspicuous honour. I know many believe none things, care them; repudiate necessity duty early godliness; set ideal all, would expose charge sentiment enthusiasm, charge dread villainy itself. These men regard heart muscle consisting four cavities, called respectively auricles ventricles, useful purpose aerate blood; meanings word despise ignore. They regard world scene probation, passage newer higher life, "convenient feeding-trough" every low passion unworthy impulse; place build foundation universal scepticism reputation superior ability. This degradation spirit, premature cynicism, angry sneering tone superior own, addiction low lying satire, misbegotten child envy disbelief, infected literature deplorable almost hopeless extent. It might sufficient leave it, rottenness inflation, every good man's silent scorn, also largely tainted intellect young. If, popular papers magazines, boys read that, boy, lying natural venial; courtesy to, love for, master, impossible hypocritical; swearing corrupt communication peccadilloes none preachers pedagogues regard discreditable--how expect success labours toil lives, amid neglect ingratitude, elevate boys England higher holier view? I seen taint _atheistic disregard sin_ poison article article, infuse bitter principle many young man's heart; worse this--adopted writers consider mighty intellect leaders opinion, I seen corrode consciences degrade philosophy far better far worthier men. It solemn duty protest, force heart conscience, dangerous gospel sin, "giving manhood's vices privilege boyhood." It _not_ gospel taught Saint Winifred's; taught baptised Christian boys, seal God's covenant foreheads, oath His service consciences, His children, members His Son, inheritors His kingdom; His laws safeguard, bodies temples His Spirit. We taught--_that_ left mighty intellects age discover--that boys, Christian principle Christian standard comprehension, alien possible attainments; believe then, I now, clear river likely flow polluted stream, good tree grow bitter fibres cankered roots. Walter others spent happy evening Mr Percival. When tea talked freely him, his presence, would done among themselves; occasional society elders superiors every way good them. It enlarged sympathies, widened knowledge, raised moral tone. Among many subjects evening talked one never fails interest deeply every right-minded boy--I mean homes. It wonder that, Walter talked glories Semlyn lake surrounding hills, his face lighted up, his eyes shone pleasant memories. Mr Percival, he looked him, felt puzzled ever his gone wrong, confirmed ever opinion he hard unjust late, his original estimate right one all. Power's home statelier one Walter's. His father, Sir Lawrence Power, baronet, owner broad acres, whose large beautiful mansion stood one undulations park shadowed ancestral trees, whose boughs deer fed graceful fawns around them. Through park flowed famous river, windings haunted herons kingfishers, pleasant waters abounded trout salmon. And estate title Power heir; though course he tell he spoke lovely scenery around home his fathers long lived. Henderson, again, son rich merchant, two houses-- one city one suburban. He regular little man world. After holidays he always seen last feats Saltori, heard recent strains Tiralirini. He always went round entertainments, would make laugh hour he sang songs imitated style last comic actor Ethiopian minstrel. While chatting holiday amusements occupations, Kenrick said little; and, wondering his silence, Mr Percival asked part world he lived. "I, sir?" he said, though awaked reverie; "Oh, I live Fuzby, village border fens, middle heavy clays." And Kenrick turned away his head. "Do not abuse clay," said Walter cheer up; "I am fond clay; produces good roses good strawberries--and two best things going, soil." "Half-past ten, youngsters," said Mr Percival, holding his watch; "off bed. Let grounds; here is key. Good-night you. Walter," he said, calling back he leave, "one word alone; three wait moment outside. I wanted tell that, although I seemed harsh you, I dare say, late, yet I hear making honourable efforts, I quite forgotten past. My good opinion you, Walter, quite restored; whenever want quiet learn lessons, may always come sit room." Mr Percival Saint Winifred's master thus generously abridged his leisure privacy assist boys he felt interest. Walter thanked real gratitude, rejoined three. "He is let sit his room," said Walter. "Has he?" said Henderson; "so he me. How jolly! shall get twice well." "What is that?" said Power, pointing upwards, walked garden house door. Glancing direction, Walter saw light suddenly go his dormitory, great bundle (apparently) disappear inside window, shut down. "I will go see," he said. "Good-night, fellows." All quiet he reached his room, one candles, ineffectually extinguished, still smoking, he looked Eden's bed he saw gaslight shone open door, child awake, crying bitterly. "What is matter, Eden?" he said kindly, sitting upon his bed. "If peach," said Harpour Jones together; "you know you will get." "Have fellows bullying poor little Eden?" asked Walter indignantly. "I have not," "I have not," said Anthony Franklin, better rest every way; "I have not touched fellow, Evson," said Cradock, meant harm, Walter's earnest request never annoyed Eden since first night. "Poor little Eden--poor little fiddlestick," said Jones, "it young cub good." "Send home his grandmamma, let his bib his night-cap," growled Harpour; "is he made butter, afraid his melting, Evson, make fuss him? You want lickings yourself, shall do not look out." "I do not care _me_, Harpour," rejoined Walter, "and I do not think you will much. But I tell it is blackguard shame great big fellow like torment little delicate chap like Eden; what is more, shall not it." "Shall not! patience. I like I why, prevent me?" "I suppose he will turn sneak, peach," said Jones; "he would anything that is mean, know." Walter always liable taunt now. It part his punishment, one lasted longest. From boy he might winced it; really, coming Jones, contemptible notice. "You shut up, Jones," he said angrily; "you shall not touch Eden again, I tell you, whatever Harpour does, he would better look he does." "Look yourself," said Harpour, flinging football boot Walter's head. "You will find boot grass outside to-morrow morning," said Walter, opening window, dropping down. He was not bit afraid, he always went instinctive never-mistaken assumption, bully must coward his inmost nature. Cruelty weaker incompatible generosity true courage. "By Jove, I will thrash to-morrow," shouted Harpour. "_To-morrow_!" said Walter great contempt. "Oh, do not make angry, Walter," whispered Eden; "you know strong fellow he is," (Eden shuddered, though _he_ reason know); "and cannot fight him; must not get thrashing sake. I am worth that. I would rather bear myself, Walter--indeed I would." "Good-night, poor little Eden," said Walter; "you are safe to-night rate. Why, cold are! What _have_ you?" "I dare not tell to-night, Walter; I to-morrow," he answered low tone, shivering over. "Well, then, go sleep now, little man; do not afraid Harpour one else. I will not let bully I help it." Eden squeezed Walter's hand tight, sobbed his thanks, Walter gently smoothed child's pillow dried his tears. Poor Eden! I said before, he weak, delicate, tenderly nurtured, far, far young battle life public school. For even Saint Winifred's, must great schools, black sheep flock undiscovered, therefore unseparated rest. CHAPTER TWELVE. MY BROTHER'S KEEPER. "It Is thus thus. Our bodies gardens wills gardeners." Othello, Act One Scene 3. As Walter lay awake quiet moments he sent his thoughts rest, he glanced critically, like Indian gymnosophist, occurrences day. He could rejoice last person he felt real regard forgiven his rash act, his offence thus finally absolved earth heaven. He rejoiced, too, Mr Percival's kind permission learn his lessons his room would give far greater advantages opportunities he hitherto enjoyed. Yet Walter's conscience quite ease. The last scene disturbed him. The sobs shiverings little Eden fallen reproachfully his heart. Walter felt he might done far he done. He had, indeed, even throughout his absorbing troubles, extended child general protection, special care. It never occurred excuse thought he "not his brother's keeper." The truth he found Eden uninteresting, he taken pains interested him, one voice within his heart reproved neglect selfishness, another voice seemed say him, firm yet kindlier tone, "Now thou converted, strengthen thy brethren." For indeed yet Eden's unhappy lot. Bullied, teased, persecuted among accident first thrown him, judged belong set others account considered boy bad sort, he almost friendless Saint Winifred's. And loneliness, despair feeling, weighing upon his heart, robbed courage face difficulties work, school well it, he always trouble. He ever clumsily scrawling his illegible hand crooked blotted lines punishment his seeming ignorance sluggishness brought upon him; although he always seen detention, he almost hailed disgrace affording least miserable shadow occupation, refuge, however undesirable, torments degraded his childish tears, his weak entreaties, his bursts impotent passion, caused nothing low amusement. Out school his great object always hide himself; anywhere, beyond reach Jones, Harpour, bullies calibre. For purpose he would conceal whole afternoon time fir-groves, listlessly gathering heaps red sheddings umbrage, pulling pieces dry fragrant cones; or, he feared resorts would disturbed little gang lounging smokers, he would choose lonely place, shadow mountain cliffs, sit hours together, aimlessly rolling white lumps quartz shingly banks. Under continued trials like he became quite changed. The childish innocence beauty countenance, childish frankness gaiety heart, childish quickness intelligence understanding, exchanged vacant looks, stupid indifference, half-cunning expression always induced craven fear. Accustomed, too, waited upon helped continually home his mother, gay young widow, petted spoiled him, he became slovenly untidy dress habits. He rarely found time heart write home, even he did, he well knew his mother incapable sympathy comprehension his suffering, dirty ill-spelt scrawl rarely alluded one dim consciousness brooded night day--that he could not understand life, knew he friendless, unhappy, unpitied little boy. If he could found even one unfold communicate his griefs, even one love unreservedly, inner beauty brightness his character would blown expanded genial warmth. He thought Walter he found one, he saw his dullness bored Walter, his listless manners untidy habits made cross, he shrank back within himself. He thankful Walter protector, look upon friend he could implicitly confide. The flower without sunshine lose colour perfume. Six weeks Arthur Eden, merry, bright-eyed child, alighted his mother's carriage old gate Saint Winifred's school, casual stranger would recognised pale moping little fellow seemed afraid every one he met. Oh, knew rare, sweet, deep human love be, easily, yet seldom gained, inexpressible treasure _has_ gained, trample human hearts lightly men do! Any one hard time spoken kindly words Eden--any one would taken gently short hand, helped stony places hurt his unaccustomed feet--any one would suffered, would invited him, pour his sorrows ears assist sustain them--might won, even slight cost, deepest passionate love trembling young heart. He might saved hours numbing pain, rich reward gratitude well-deserved generously repaid. There many boys Saint Winifred's gentle-hearted, right-minded, kindly manly impulses; them, except Walter, lost golden opportunity conferring pure happiness disinterested good deeds. They buy occasion, goes away burns priceless books she offers, purchased unquestioningly once. And Walter regretfully felt he nearly late; nearly, perhaps week two Eden might lost hopelessly, ever, trace self-respect--might benumbed mental imbecility torpedo-like influence helpless grief. Walter felt he selfishly looking fellow-creature fast sinking water, last possible moment he held saving hand. But, God's grace, he _did_ hold saving hand last, grasped firmly, dear life saved. Years Arthur Eden grown into--but stop, I must far anticipate story. Suffice say, Walter's kindness Eden, helped bring long afterwards one chief happinesses his life. "Come stroll, Eden, third school, let us talk," he said, came dinner hall next day. Eden looked happily, he proud seen Walter's side throng boys, passed out, across court, shadow arch towards Walter's favourite haunt, seashore. Walter never felt weak unhappy long together, sweetness sea-wind his forehead, song sea waves his ear. A run upon shore weathers, five minutes, his daily pleasure resource. They sat down; sea flashed mirror molten gold, except summits great mountain Appenfell threw deep broad shadows, seemed purple contrast brightness fell. Walter sat, full healthy enjoyment he breathed pure atmosphere, felt delicious wind upon his glowing cheeks; Eden happy him, sit quietly his side. "Eden," said Walter, moments, "I am afraid you have happy lately." The poor child shook his head, answered, "No one cares here; every one looks me, unkind; I have friends." "What, do not count friend, then?" "Yes, Walter, you are kind; I am sure I _couldn't_ lived had not you; you are much me, and--" Walter would press fill omission, he could understand rest sentence himself. "You must not think I do not feel good you have me, Walter," said boy, drawing near him, taking his hand; "but--" "Yes, yes," said Walter; "I understand all. Well, never mind, I _will_ friend now." A tear trembled Eden's long eyelashes he looked quickly Walter's face. "Will you, Walter? thank you, I friend here; please--" "Well, it?" "Will call Arthur, home?" Walter smiled. "Well now," he said, "tell last night?" "You will not tell I told you, Walter," he answered, looking round, old look decrepit fear usurping his face, brightened moment. "No, no," said Walter, impatiently; "why, little coward are, Eden." The boy shrank back he received blow, relaxed his grasp Walter's hand; Walter, struck sensitive timidity unkindness caused, sorry given pain his troubles, said kindly-- "There, Arty, never mind; I did not mean it; do not afraid; tell you. I saw light dormitory I coming back Percival's, I saw something dragged window. What it?" "That me," said Eden naively. "You?" "Yes; poor me. They let sheet tied round waist." "What, high window? I hope tied tight." "Only one knot; I ever nearly slipped last night, that is frightened so, Walter." "How horribly dangerous," said Walter indignantly. "I know horribly dangerous," said Eden, standing up, gesticulating violently, one bursts passion flashed then, chief amusement his persecutors; "and I dream night," he said, bursting tears, "and I know, I know day I shall slip, knot come undone, I shall fall smashed atoms. But care that? I sometimes wish I dead myself, over." "Hush, Arty, do not talk like that," said Walter, he felt little soiled hand trembling passion emotion his own. "But earth let for?" "To go to--but will not tell?" he said, looking round again. "Oh, I forgot, did not like saying that. But it is made coward, Walter; indeed is." "And wonder," thought Walter himself. "But need not afraid more," he said aloud; "I promise one shall anything they would afraid me." "Then I am safe," said Eden, joyfully. "Well, made go to--to Dan's." "Dan's? what, fisherman's near shore." "Yes; ugh!" "But do not know, Arty, Dan's brute, regular smuggler, caught going there, you would sent away?" "Yes; cannot think, Walter, I _hate_, frightened I go there. There is Dan, there is great lout wicked son his, they are always drunk, hut--ugh! it is nasty; last night Dan seized hold his horrid red hand, wanted drink gin, I shrieked." The remembrance seemed make shudder. "Well, then, I nearly caught. I think, Walter, even would coward long long frights. You know get Dan's, gates locked, way go railing, Dr Lane's garden, I am always frightened death lest his great dog loose, catch hold me. He growl last night. And I hurrying back--you know rather moonlight last night, cold--and I see Doctor walking garden. I crouched minute behind thick holly-tree, I suppose I made rustle, though I held breath, Doctor stopped shook tree, said `shoo,' though he thought cat hidden there. I half dead fright, though I hope, all, he would catch me, I might sent away horrid place. But he turned round, I crept away, made signal, let sheet, then, hauling up, I heard voices--I suppose must Kenrick's; thought master, doused glim, oh! nearly let fall; so, Walter, please do not despise me, angry found crying shivering bed. The cold made shiver, I could not help crying; indeed I could not." "Poor Arty, poor Arty," said Walter, soothingly. "But ever done before?" "Yes, once, choir-supper, one night." "They never shall again, I swear," said Walter, frowning, he thought detestably cruel been. "But send for?" "For good," said Eden. "No; I knew would good, Dan's sent you." "Well, Walter, first time drink; second time drink," he said, little hesitation. Walter looked serious. "But do not know, Arty," he said, "that it is wrong get things them? If want dealings beast Dan, who is fit speak to, let go themselves. Arty, it is wrong; must not it." "But I help it?" said boy, looking frightened ashamed. "Oh, must I always blamed every one," he said, putting his hands his eyes. "It is not sin, Walter, it is theirs. They made me." "_Nobody ever make anyone else what is wrong_, Arty." "Oh, yes; it is easy _you_ say that, Walter, fight anybody, strong good, one dares bully, laughed at, made butt of, I am." "Look Power," said Walter, "or look Dubbs. They came young you, Arty, weak you, one ever made _them_ wrong. Power somehow looks noble bullied anyone; they are afraid him, I do not know why. But Dubbs protect him? Yet Harpours world would ever make go place Dan's." Poor Eden felt hard blamed this; he yet strong enough learn path duty, however hard thorny, however hedged difficulties antagonisms, always easiest pleasantest end. "But they would half kill me, Walter," he said plaintively. "They will much chance is," said Walter. "They would thrash little, doubt, respect it. And surely would better bear one thrashing, what is wrong, go two journeys window, get thrashings bargain? So even _that_ ground ought refuse. Eh, Arty?" "Yes, Walter," he said, casting his eyes. "Well; next time either Harpour, one else, tries make what is wrong, remember _can't_ make you, do not choose; say flatly `_No_!' stick spite everything, like brave little man, you?" "I say `No!' first, Walter; threatened frighten me," he said. "They knew I dare not hold out." Yes; secret all. Walter saw played child's natural terrors refinement cruelty, fear become master principle his mind; touch spring he obeyed mechanically like puppet, his fear, driven things might well genuine fear, till he lived region increasing fear dread, Walter's surprise he made idiot already. Poor child! wonder he becoming stupid, cunning, untidy, uninteresting, every day. And going eyes many thoroughly noble boys, conscientious masters, yet never saw noticed it, looked Eden idle unprincipled little sloven. O harsh human judgments! The Priest Levite still pass wounded man, good Samaritans rare world's highways. What Walter do? He know name psychology, he know unhinging, desolating power overmastering spirit fear. He knew fear hath torment, he conception means demon exorcised. Yet he thought, he raised his eyes one instant heaven silent supplication, devils would go prayer, he made strong resolve he would use every endeavour make his past neglectfulness, save poor unhappy child. "I am blaming you, Arthur," he said, "but I like you, do not want see go wrong, tool bad boys' hands. I hope ask God help you, Arthur?" Eden looked him, said nothing. He taught little, example he taught _nothing_ Awful Far-off Friend Who yet near every humble spirit, Who even sent His angel save lamb knew His fold. "Listen me, Arthur--ah! I hear third school-bell, must go in--but listen! I will friend; I want friend. I will try save persecution. Will always trust me?" Eden's look gratitude repaid him, Walter added, "And, Arty, must give prayers. Ask God help you, keep going wrong, make brave. Will not you, Arty?" The little boy's heart full even breaking weight happy tears; full speak. He pressed Walter's hand one moment, walked his side, without word. CHAPTER THIRTEEN. DAUBENY. La Genie c'est la Patience. Buffon. I suppose days life happy great sorrow removed. Certainly Walter's days his heart grew lighter lighter consciousness Mr Paton forgiven him, looked coldly come round, his difficulties vanishing steady diligence, that, young he was, he winning name position school, full peace. O pleasant days boyhood! mercifully granted prepare us, cheer us, make us wise struggles future life. To Walter time life exhilarating enjoyment. To get morning bright, cheerful, refreshed, thoughts: "Pleasant roses thickets blown, And pure dew bathing crimson leaves;" get his lessons easily successfully, receive Mr Paton's quiet word praise; shake laughing flood nonsense Henderson always deluged everyone sat near breakfast-time; help little Eden his morning's work, see intense affection almost adoration child looked him; stroll Kenrick pine woods, pleasant chat Power's pretty little study, read book luxurious retirement Mr Percival's room, or, half-holiday, join skating, hare hounds, football, whatever game might hand--all things Walter Evson one long unbroken pleasure. At time he brightest, pleasantest, happiest light-hearted happy English boys. The permission go whenever he liked Mr Percival's room his valued privilege. There he could always secure immunity disturbance enabled learn his lessons half time he would otherwise obliged devote them; he could always ask master's assistance he came insuperable difficulty, always enjoy society Henderson one two boys allowed Mr Percival's kindness use retreat. From bottom his form he rapidly rose top, last actually placed first. A murmur pleasure ran form first Sunday his name read honourable position, gave Walter nearly much satisfaction hear Henderson's name read _sixth_ day; Walter came, Henderson volatile ever care he stood form, usually spent his time school drawing caricatures masters, writing parodies lesson epigrams boys; till time Daubeny always first form, he deserved place boy did. He clever boy, nothing could exceed his well-intentioned industry. Like Sir Walter Raleigh he "toiled terribly." It almost pathetic sight see Dubbs set learning his repetitions; noble sight, too. There heroism greater unnoticed unrecorded. Poor Dubbs privacy except great schoolroom could afford, much privacy room, however large, common habitation fifty boys. Nevertheless, undaunted Daubeny would choose quietest loneliest corner room, elbows knees hands his ears shut chaotic noises surrounded him, would stay repeating lines attention wholly concentrated absorbed, until, perhaps hour's work, he knew enough enable finish mastering next morning. Next morning he would earliest dawn, would set task grand determination, content end week he gained distinguished reward head his form, could allow keen pleasure writing home tell his mother his success. When Daubeny first come Saint Winifred's, he forced go great persecution. As he sat his work he would pelted orange peel, kicked, tilted form he sat, ridiculed, sometimes chased room. All he endured admirable patience good humour; short, patiently good-humouredly boys spark sense honour soon abandoned system torment, made far could respect kindness, always, however, took less form banter. It expected boys ever made see steady, strenuous industry, even fails, greater better thing idle cleverness, far advance years intuition fact, felt character Daubeny, value gave influence rare important kind. For nothing could daunt young martyr--not even failure itself. If he much bullied annoyed get his lesson overnight, he would five morning working unremitting assiduity. Very often he _overdid_ it, knew his lesson worse proportion he spent upon great amount time. Without positively stupid, his intellect somewhat dull, his manner shy awkward he quite understood first, master taken specially hand lighten his burdens. His bitterest trial, therefore, fail completely every then, reproached master little knew hours weary work he devoted unsuccessful attempt. This particularly case his first half-year, he Mr Robertson's form. It happened that, weariness brain induced his working hard, he failed several successive lessons, Mr Robertson, man quick temper stinging speech, made cutting remarks upon him, sent him, moreover, detention--a punishment caused his sensitive mind pain hardly less acute master's pungent undeserved sarcasm. This mishap, joined his low weekly placing, nearly filled despair, day might turned scale, fixed position heavy disheartened boy, Power, come Saint Winifred's time Daubeny, who, although his unusually rapid progress he long left Daubeny behind, form dormitory him, knew he worked. Power used always say his friends Dubbs worthiest, bravest, upright conscientious boy Saint Winifred's school. Daubeny, hand, Power kind adoration savage sun; he boy's beau-ideal perfect scholar perfect being.--It curious sight see two boys together Power his fine thoughtful face beaming intelligence, Dubbs large, heavy features awkward gait; Power sitting his book perfectly mastering lesson quarter hour, turning round say, bright arch look, "Well, Dubbs, I have learnt lesson; far you?" "Learnt lesson? O, lucky fellow. I know one stanza perfectly; let see--`Nam quid Typhoeus et validus Mimas nam quid'--no; I do not know even that, I see." "Here, let hear you." Whereupon Dubbs would begin again, flounder hopelessly end third line, Power would continue him, fix sense his memory, read over, suggest little mnemonic dodges associations particular words lines, leave he knew heart, ready gratitude enough pluck his right eye give Power, needed, then. The early failures speaking took place Power staying school severe cold, sickroom seen Daubeny all. He come morning when, Daubeny's failure, Mr Robertson called incorrigibly slothful incapable, muttering invectives said something his hopeless. As he listened master's remarks, although he knew arose misconception, Power's cheeks flushed painful surprise, his eyes sparkled indignation his friend. He wanted Daubeny tell Mr Robertson many hours he spent "incorrigibly slothful" particular lesson, time he could get do. "Besides," said Daubeny, "if he knows quite hopeless"-- poor boy grew scarlet he recalled undeserved insult--"it is disgrace fail." When detention over, Power sought his friend, found sitting top little hill side river, alone, forlornly disconsolate air. Power saw he crying bitterly, much good taste take notice fact. "Well, Power, see credit I get, yet know I try. I am `bad, idle boy,' seems, `incorrigibly slothful,' `hardly fit school,' `I must put lower form I do not make effort'--oh! I forgot though, heard yourself. So know character," he said, melancholy smile. "Never mind, old fellow. You have done best, none us more. You know soldier's epitaph--`Here lies one tried his duty'--a prince could better, deserve anyone ever did." "I wish I you, Power," said Daubeny; "you clever, learn lessons time; everyone likes you, get end credit, I am mere butt, I have worked hard it is case _Kathedeitai honos_, lesson-book says." "Pooh, Dubbs," said Power, kindly putting his arm his shoulder; "you are happy I am. A fellow clear conscience _can't_ low spirits long. Do not remember pretty verse I read day, made think I read it-- "`Days that, spite Of darkness, light Of clear mind day night?'" "Do not think I _envy_ you, Power--you will not think that, you?" said Dubbs tears glistening his eyes. "No, no, dear old boy. Such nature cannot envy, I know; I am sure you are happy I succeed succeed yourself. I think I have got secret it, Dubbs. You work _too_ much; must take exercise--play games more--give less time work. I am sure you will better then, half better whole sometimes. And Dubbs, I may say I would not say boy whole school--but I have found _so_ true, I am sure too, is, Bene orasse est bene studuisse." Dubbs pressed his hand silence. The hard thoughts gathering dissipated moment, he walked back school new heroic efforts Power's side, he felt he learnt secret full strength. He better better. He broke neck his difficulties one one, soon surpassed boys far brilliant, less industrious, himself. Thus he fought his way position one steadiest influential boys among his standing, knew sterling his virtues, unswerving his rectitude, humble, sincere. During his school career he never overtaken serious fault. It may he fewer temptations boys gifted mercurial; he never exposed singularly powerful trials compensated superiority others good looks, popular manners, quick passions; yet his blamelessness something beautiful, his noble upward struggles remembered fond pleasure days. Walter, like sensible boys, felt Daubeny sincere admiration regard. Daubeny's fearless rectitude, night his indulged temper led suffering, left deep impression his mind, and, since then, Dubbs always among number his intimate friends. Hence, Walter wrested head place, he half sorry he boy lose his well-merited success, almost wished he come second, left Daubeny first. He knew his rival's nature particle envy, still he feared he might suffer disappointment. But he mistaken; Daubeny firm believer principle _La carriere ouverte aux talons_; he was, circumstances, quite happy second first; among many congratulated Walter, none heartier sincerity generous single-minded boy. People still retain notion boyish emulation almost certain hatreds jealousies. Usually, fact reverse. An _ungenerous_ rivalry unusual, schoolfellows dispute boy prizes form commonly his intimate associates his best friends. Certainly, Daubeny liked Walter none less his wrested away much ease distinction caused strenuous efforts win. The pleasant excitement contending weekly position made Daubeny work harder ever. Indeed, whole form seemed received new stimulus lately. Henderson astonishing everybody fit diligence, even Howard Tracy seemed less totally indifferent his place usual. So willingly boys work, Mr Paton half number punishments set, perhaps his late misfortune infused little tenderness consideration character always somewhat stern unbending. But, instead rising, Daubeny lost places his increased work; he making ill work. At end next week, instead first second, he fifth; Mr Percival, always his friend, rallied descent, he sighed deeply, complained he suffering lately headaches, supposed prevented well usual. This remark rather alarmed master, Sunday afternoon he asked boy come walk him, express purpose endeavouring persuade relax efforts obviously made injury his health. When fairly reached meadows riverside, Mr Percival said him-- "You overdoing it, Daubeny. I see mind tense, excited, nervous condition work; must lie fallow, dear boy." "O! I am strong, sir," said Daubeny; "I have cast-iron constitution, amusing plague mine, Henderson, always tells me." "Never mind, must really work less. I will not getting five morning. If do not take care, I shall _forbid_ higher twentieth form heavy penalties, I shall get Dr Keith send home altogether, let go examination." "O! no, sir, really must not that. I assure I enjoy work. An illness I I child hindered threw back much, cannot think eager I make lost time." "The time lost, dear Daubeny, God demanded illness His good purposes. Be persuaded, boy; abandon, present, struggle take high place feel quite well again, shall work hard like. Remember, knowledge valueless comparison health." Daubeny felt master's kind intention; he could restrain his unconquerable eagerness get on. He would succumbed far sooner, Walter Power constantly dragged almost force, made take exercise his will. But, though he naturally strong healthy, he began look pale, his best friends urged go home take holiday. Would he taken good kind advice! CHAPTER FOURTEEN. APPENFELL. To breathe difficult air Of iced mountain top. Manfred. Fetzo auf den Schroffen Zinken Hangt sie, auf dem hochsten Grat, Wo die Felsen jah versinken, Und verschwunden ist der Pfad. Schiller. It weeks examination, close half-year, one day Walter, full glee, burst schoolroom twelve, lesson over, tell Kenrick announcement made forms, next day whole holiday. "Hurrah!" said Kenrick, "what is for?" "O! Somers got end scholarship Cambridge--an awfully swell thing--and Dr Lane gave holiday directly he got telegram announcing news." "Well done, old Somers!" said Kenrick. "What shall do?" "O! I have scheme long time head, Ken; I want come top Appenfell." "Whew-w-w! it is tremendous long walk, one goes winter." "Never mind, fun glory, shall whole day us. I have longing beat proud old Appenfell long time. I am certain it." "But mean two go alone?" "O, no; we will ask Flip, amuse us way." "And may I ask Power?" "If like," said Kenrick, was, I sorry say, little jealous friendship sprung Power Walter. "And would mind Daubeny joining us?" "Not all; he is clearly overworking himself. It will good. Let see--you, Power, Flip, Dubbs, me; that will enough, will not it?" "Well, I like ask Eden." "Eden!" said Kenrick least little touch contempt his tone voice. "Poor little fellow," said Walter smiling sadly; "so you, too, despise him. No wonder he does not get on." "O! let come means, like," said Kenrick. "Thanks, Ken--but I come think it, it is far him. Never mind; let us go dinner, order sandwiches to-morrow, forage generally, Cole's." Power Daubeny gladly consented join excursion. At tea, Walter asked Henderson he would come them, he, phase nonsense made speak everything manner intended Homeric, answered oracular gravity-- "Him addressed reply laughter-loving son Hender: Thou askest me, oh Evides, like immortals, Whether thee I accompany, much-enduring Dubbs, And counsellor Power, revered ox-eyed Kenrick, To tops thousand-crested many-fountained Appenfell." "Grotesque idiot," said Kenrick, laughing; "cease weak, washy, everlasting flood twaddle, tell us whether you will come no." "Him sternly eyeing, addressed reply mighty Henderides, Heavy tea, eyes dog, heart reindeer! What word escaped thee, barrier thy teeth? Contrary right, according right, hast thou spoken." "For goodness' sake shut you have driven us stark raving mad," said Walter, putting his hand Henderson's lips. "Now, yes no; come?" "Thee I accompany--" said Henderson, struggling get clear Walter, "to many-fountained Appenfell--" "Hurrah! that will do. We got answer last; go spouting whole Iliad like." Full spirits started breakfast next morning, climbed higher higher steep mountainside, keen air exhilarated them, showed, crystal glass, exceeding glory hills flung every side around them, broad living sparkle sea caught glimpses nearer peaks. Walter, Henderson, Kenrick, front, distance behind them, Power helped Daubeny, soon showed signs fatigue. "Look pappy fellow, Evson," said Daubeny, sighing; "how he bounding along front. How active he is." "You seem spirits," said Power kindly; "what is matter?" "Oh, nothing. A little tired, that is all." "You are surely fretting lost head place." "Oh, no. `Palmam qui meruit ferat.' As Robertson said day his odd, fantastic way expressing his thoughts--`In amber duty must always expect find curious grub success.'" "Depend upon it, you would higher worked less, dear fellow. Let persuade you--do not work examination more." "You mistake me. It is _place_ I work, I want _know_, _learn_; grow quite stupid empty-headed I otherwise do." "What love work have, Daubeny." "Yes, I now; know really was not natural me. As child, I used idle get badly, used vex poor father, living, much. Well, one day, long he died, I obstinate, would learn nothing. He did not say much, afternoon, taking walk, passed old barn, thatched roof lot grass stonecrop. He plucked handful, showed rank useless was, then, resting his hand upon head, he told type idle, useless man--`grass upon housetops, withered groweth up, wherewith mower filleth his hand, he gathereth sheaves his bosom.' Somehow, circumstance took hold imagination; last scene poor father I vividly remember. I never idle since then." Power mused little, said--"But, dear Dubbs, you will make brain heavy time examination begins; will not able justice." He answer; weary look, Power often observed, anxiety, came his face. "I am afraid I must turn back, Power," he said; "I am quite tired--done up." "I have thinking so, too. Let turn back you." "No, no! I will not spoil day's excursion. Let go alone." "Hi! fellows," said Power, shouting three front. They far advance hear him, he told Daubeny sit he overtook them, asked would prefer turn back. "Dubbs tired go farther," he said, he reached them, breathless his run. "I do not think he is well, I will go back him." "O, no; really must not, _I_ will," said three almost breath. Every one four anxious get on, reach top Appenfell, considered great feat among boys even summer, climb dangerous severe; yet generously wished undergo self-denial turning back. As wills equally strong, would ended _all_ accompanying Daubeny, he not, reached him, positively refused turn conditions, suggested decide drawing lots. Power wrote names slips paper, Walter drew one hazard. The lot fell Henderson, he took Daubeny's arm, relieving his disappointment turning round, shaking his fist top Appenfell, saying, "You hanged! I wish rolled _quite flat_ planted potatoes!" "There," said Power laughing, "I think grossest indignity Genius Appenfell ever offered him; you have revenge, take care Dubbs. Good-bye." "How kind come me, Flip," said Daubeny; "I do not think I could manage get home without help; I am quite vexed drag back. Good-bye, fellows." Walter, Power, Kenrick, found reach cairn top Appenfell taxed strength. The mountain seemed heave succession huge shoulders, one surmounted showed fresh steeps climb. At last, reached piled confusion rocks, painted every gorgeous brilliant colour emerald moss golden lichen, marked approach summit; Walter, long way first get top, shouted encourage two, and, resting minutes, clambered assist progress. Being accustomed hills, he far less tired were, could give efficient help. At top rested time, eating scanty lunch, chatting, enjoying matchless splendour prospect stretched cloudless expanse every side. "Power," said Walter, pause talk, "I have long meaning ask favour." "It is granted, then," said Power, "if _you_ ask it, Walter." "I am sure; it is serious favour, is not myself; moreover, it is cool." "The greater is, I shall know trust friendship, Walter; and, it is cool, suits time place." "Yet, I bet you will hesitate I propose it." "Well, it; make curious." "It you would give little Eden run study." "Little Eden run study! O, yes, wish it," said Power, liking object he said, flushing little, involuntarily. It indeed great favour ask. Power's study perfect sanctum; he furnished rare good taste, that, entered, eye attracted pretty print neat contrivance wherever looked. It Power's peculiar pride pleasure beautify his little room, sit one he liked; give his privacy, let little scapegrace like Eden free run it, proposition took surprise. Yet good deal Power's sake Walter ventured ask it. Power's great fault his over-refinement; fastidiousness marred his proper influence, made unpopular many boys, shut reserved introspective habit mind. By kind instinct, Walter felt would good disturb epicurean indifference general interests school, kind intellectualism weakened character attractive affectionate, yet shy self-involved boy. "Ah, I see," said Walter archly; "you are bad Kenrick; Priests Levites will not touch poor little wounded traveller." "But I do not see I could him," said Power; "I should not know talk about." "O, yes, would; do not know his gratitude would pay least interest shown him. He is shamefully bullied, poor little chap, I hardly like tell even things big brute Harpour made do. He came bright neat, merry innocent; now--" He would finish sentence, his voice faltered; checking himself, he added, calmly--"This, remember, done poor little fellow _here_, Saint Winifred's; I remember I might time, for--but one two friends, heart quite bleeds him. Anyhow, I think one ought one him. I wish I would study, I know, he should not little fellow share it. I have got much good able learn lessons Percival's room, I would give anything able much one else." "He shall come, Walter," said Power, "with heart. I will ask directly get back Saint Winifred's." "Will you? I thank you. That _is_ good you; I am sure will not sorry long-run." Power Kenrick thinking new friend theirs, though he short time Saint Winifred's, teaching valuable lessons. Neither previously recognised truth Walter seemed feel strongly, extent directly responsible opportunities lost helping strengthening boys around them. Neither ever done anything, worth speaking of, lighten heavy burden laid little boys Saint Winifred's; heard Walter talking something like remorse child special claim whatever his kindness, he felt he might efficiently rescued evil associates, evil words, evil ways, heart-misery cannot fail bring. The sense new mission, neglected duty, dawned upon both. They sat time silent, Kenrick, shaking his reverie, pointed hill said-- "Do look magnificent clouds; come surging hill huge curving masses." "Yes," said Power; "does not look like grand charge giant cavalry? Why, Walter, dear fellow, frightened look." "Well, no," said Walter, "not frightened. But I say, two, supposing clouds gathered suddenly do not clear away, think could find way hill?" "I do not know; I almost think so," said Kenrick dubiously. "Ah, Ken, I suspect have not much experience mountain-mists I have. We _may_ find way somehow; but--" "You mean," said Power, strange calmness, "that lots precipices about, shepherds several times lost hills?" "Let us hope mist clear away, then," said Walter; "anyhow, let us get grass, awkward boulders, surrounded." "By means," said Kenrick; "charges cloud-cavalry well way; but--" CHAPTER FIFTEEN. IN THE CLOUDS. The three boys scrambled speed, Walter helping two vast primeval heap many-tinted rock-fragments form huge summit Appenfell, found short slippery grass, hardened recent frosts, barely covered wave-like sweep hill-side. Meanwhile, vast dense masses white cloud gathered them, resting hollows mountains like gigantic walls bastions, leaning abrupter face precipice one great unbroken barrier opaque, immaculate, impenetrable pearl. As looked upon chief impression gave one immense thickness crushing weight. It seemed compressed impermeable one could fancy even thunderbolt could shatter it, wildest blast hurricane dissipate enormous depth. But yet enveloped peaks themselves. On sun yet shone, boys stood still bathed keen yet blue sunny air, islanded far noiseless billows surging cloud. This long. Gradually, almost imperceptibly, clouds stole upon them--reached white arms enfolded sudden whirls thin smoke-like mist; eddied heads round feet; swathed last funeral pall, blotting sight every object save wreaths dank vapour, rendering wholly uncertain direction moving, giving sense doubt danger every step took. Kenrick told master given leave absence dinner meant go long walk. He mentioned Appenfell, want straightforwardness, thought might sound like vainglorious attempt, want talk really accomplished it. But truth mentioned destination, wise master would given permission go, unless promised accompanied guide; ascent Appenfell, dangerous even summer well knew features mountain, became winter perilous foolhardy attempt. The boys themselves, started excursion, conception amount extent risk ran. Seeing morning gave promises bright clear day, never thought taking account possibility mists storms. The position found enough make stout heart quail. By time hopelessly enveloped palpable clouds, could see largest objects yard them. In fact, even see keep closely side side; once, Kenrick separated little distance, sound his shouts found again. After this, crept perfect silence, trying conceal terror lay like frost his spirits; unsuccessfully, tremulous sound quick palpitation hearts gave breathing showed plainly enough three recognised frightfulness danger. Appenfell one mountains, unfrequent, one side abrupt bounded wall almost fathomless precipice, descends plain cataract billowy undulations. It one feature which, although peculiar, means unprecedented. At one point, huge rock wall towers ghastly depth broad ravine, lateral ridge--not unlike Mickeldore Scawfell Pikes--running right across valley, connecting Appenfell Bardlyn, another hill much lower elevation, towards ridge runs long gradual slope. This edge significantly called Razor, narrow would barely admit passage single person along summit. It occasionally passed shepherds, accustomed earliest childhood hills, ordinary traveller ever dreamed braving real dangers, for, even path broader, horrible depth fall either side quite sufficient render dizzy steadiest head, false step taken, result, absolute certainty, frightful death. For nearly perpendicular sides curious partition, narrow valley below, offering temptation one visit it, not, within memory man, trodden human foot. To add honour inspired Razor, shepherd recently fallen summer storm; his body abandoned unrecoverable, ravens wild cats fed upon him. Something--a dim gleam uncertain white among rank grass--was yet visible one point ledge, bravest mountaineer shuddered when, looking gloomy chasm, he recognised glimpse mortal remains fellow-man. "Are sure right path, Walter?" asked Power, trying speak cheerfully indifferently he could. "Certain," said Walter, pulling his pocket little brass pocket-compass his invariable companion his rambles home, he fortunately brought likely useful lonely tracts surrounded Saint Winifred's. "The bay lies due west here, I am sure _general_ direction." "But I think we are keeping much right, Walter," said Kenrick. "Look here," said Walter, stopping; "the truth is--and may well ready it--that we are two dangers. On right Bardlyn rift; left sides Appenfell, precipices, but--" "I know you are thinking of--the old mines." "Yes; that is I have keeping right. I think even mist could hardly go rift, I fancy could least discover getting close it; three four old mines; do not knew least lie exactly, one might stumble one shafts minute." "What world shall do?" said Power, stopping, he realised full intensity peril. "As cannot see we are going, soon shall darkness well mist. Besides, it is frightfully cold, obliged go slowly." "Let us stop consider we would best do," said Kenrick. "Walter, _you_ say?" "We one two things. Either go on, trust God's mercy keep us safe, sit still hope mist may clear away." "That last'll never do," answered Kenrick; "I have seen mist rest Appenfell days days." "Besides," said Power, "unless move on, hazards, night us. A December night Appenfell, without food extra coverings, chance kept indefinitely longer--" sentence ended shudder. "Yes; I do not know look like morning," said Kenrick. "Let us move on, events; better chance frozen starved death." They moved little way clouds uncertain hesitating steps, suddenly Walter cried agitated voice, "Stop! God knows are. I feel kind instinct we are somewhere near rift. I do not know else make tremble I doing; I seem _hear_ rift somehow. For God's sake stop. Just let us sit minute till I try something." "But's it is nearly four of the clock," said Kenrick querulous tone, he halted pulled his watch, holding close his face make time. "An hour daylight gone, chance saved. Surely, we would better press on. That is _uncertain_ danger, stop certain--" "Certain death," whispered Power. "Just listen then, one second," said Walter, and, disembedding huge piece stone, he rolled his force right, listening senses acutely sharpened danger excitement. The stone bounded once, heard ears rush, shuffling loose sliding earth, whirring sound heavy falling body, several seconds succession distant crashes, startling fright rebounding mountain echoes, bit rock whirled rift shattered fragments dashed sides precipice. "Good God!" cried Walter, clutching boys dragging hurriedly backwards, "we standing moment verge chasm. It will not go on; every step may death." A pause almost unspeakable horror followed his words; fall rock revealed frightful peril escaped, three moment felt paralysed every limb, looking close other's faces, blanched white deadly fear, Kenrick Power sat agony despair. "Do not give way, fellows," said Walter, seemed look help; "our chance keep hope spirits. I think that, all, must stay till mist clears up. Do not frightened, Ken," he said, taking boy's hand; "nothing happen us God intends." "But night," whispered Kenrick, overpowered three; "fancy night spent here. Mist cold, hunger dark. O horrible uncertainty suspense. O light," he cried agony; "I could almost die light." "O God, give us light," murmured Walter, echoing words, uttering aloud unconsciously his intense prayer; he fell his knees, others, too, hid faces hands stood upon bleak mountainside, prayed Him Whom knew near them, though alone, saw nothing save ground knelt upon, thick clammy fog moving slowly around aimless monotonous change. To excited imagination fog seemed like living thing; seemed though actuated cold deathful determination, though peopled thousand silent spirits, leaning chilling hearts shrouded gigantic foldings ghostly robes. And soon, though passionate prayer heard, angel sent rend mist, wind, rushing ravine, tore narrow passage--and gleam wavering light broke upon white folds deathful curtain, showing wall sunken precipice, dark outline Bardlyn hill. If moment could admired one Nature's awfully majestic sights, would gazed enthusiastic joy diorama valley mountain revealed mighty rent side misty pavilion, filled blue far-off sky; moment dominant terror room thoughts save lives danger that, surrounded them. "Light," cried Walter, springing eagerly; "thank God! Perhaps mist going clear away." But hope fallacious, direction path lay still dark, chilly mist soon closed again, though densely, wound breeze chasm momentarily made. "Did see _close Razor_?" said Walter, alone three maintained his usual courage, custom made familiar danger hills. "Now, thought strikes me, Ken Power. If like we will make attempt cross Razor. The thing lose one's footing; one cannot _miss_ way, rate, get Bardlyn it is easy get road runs round Saint Winifred's walk across school court." "Cross Razor?" said Kenrick; "why, none shepherds ever dare that." "True, man done, man do. I am certain it is best chance." "Not me;" "Or me," said two. "Well, look here," said Walter; "it would dangerous course, talk chance safety lessens. You two stay here. I will try Razor; I get safe across I shall reach Bardlyn village time, I could get men come help over. Do mind? I will not leave you would rather not." "Oh, Walter, Walter, do not run risk," said Power; "it is awful." "It is lighter ever side," said Walter; "I am bit afraid. I am certain could get safe down, way, die exposure spent night here. Remember, we have one two sandwiches apiece. It is last chance." "Oh, no, really shall not, dear Walter. You do not know terrific Razor is. I have often heard men say would not cross bag gold," said Power. "Do not hinder me, Power; I have made mind. Good-bye, Power; good-bye, Ken," he said, wringing hands hard. "If I get safe across Razor, I shall not hour half latest I stand again, bringing help. Good-bye; God bless both. Pray me, do not fear." So saying, Walter tore away them, awful sinking heart saw pass spot mist thinnest, plant steady step commencement Razor path. CHAPTER SIXTEEN. ON THE RAZOR. The brave boy knew well fate others, well his own, hung his coolness steadiness, stopping one moment see he would light enough make sure his footing along path, he turned round, shouted cheery words his two friends, stepped boldly ledge. He accustomed giddy heights, his head never turned he looked cliffs Saint Winifred's, valleys home. But his heart began beat fast painful sense every step he accomplished dangerous, nerve would readily borne brief effort would sustained fully twenty minutes, would least possible time he could make transit. The loneliness, too, frightful; three minutes he sight his friends; without companion, heart mighty mountains, traversing haunted terrible path, eye see he slip dashed atoms unconscious rocks--this thought almost overmastered him, unmanned him, filled weird sense indescribable horror. He battled his might, came like foul harpy again, sickening his whole soul, making his forehead glisten damp dews anticipated death. At last he came stunted willow twisted dry roots thin soil, and, clinging stem arms, he forced stop close his eyes, praying God's help, he summoned together faculties his soul, buffeted ghastly intruder away thoroughly return. As man might shoot vulture, look lying dead his feet, arrow heartfelt supplication Walter slew hideous imagination flapping wings him; he stir till he sure lost power. And then, opening his eyes, he bore steadily cautiously on, till sudden, fast fading sunlight, something glinted white valley beneath his feet. In moment flashed upon unreached skeleton thousand feet below, sight imparted superstitious horror Devil's Way, peasants called narrow path along Razor. Nor all: rags man's dress, torn his headlong fall, still fluttered stump blackthorn thirty feet below. And now, again, poor boy's heart quailed uncontrollable emotion physical mental fear. For moment he tottered, every nerve loosened, his legs bent him, and, dropping his knees, he clutched ground hands. It one swift spasms emotion which, moments peril, crisis usually depends. Had Walter's weak, his conscience guilty one, his strength feeble, his body unstrung ill-health, he would succumbed sudden terror, and, fainting first, would next instant rolled edge sudden inevitable death. All results written fire, he shut his eyes clung tenacious grasp earth. But happily his mind strong, his conscience stainless, his powers vigorous, his body pure health, moments, seemed age, he recovered his presence mind one noble efforts ever ready make train right. Before he opened his eyes he braced thorough strength, commending God, he rose firm cool continue his journey, averting his glance spectacle death gleamed below. He found his best plan fix his eyes rigidly path, suffer swerve moment either side. Whenever he so, wavering sensation came again, long he trod carefully never let his eyes wander place his footsteps, he found he got along securely even swiftly. He one difficulty contend. In one place sort path Razor presented broken crumbled away, Walter's heart sank despairingly within him, his attention suddenly arrested additional unexpected peril. But turn back question, seemed impossible walk feet, he knelt down, crawled steadily along hands knees, length two strides, path hard firm enough proceed before. The end accomplished; five minutes he sprang broad firm side Bardlyn hill, shouting aloud relieve his spirits tumult joy thankfulness, he raced Bardlyn, gained quickly mountain road, ran top his speed till, sun setting, he reached group cottages took name hill stood. Knocking first cottage, he inquired guide shepherd thoroughly acquainted mountain paths, directed house man named Giles, occupied years among neighbouring sheep-walks. Giles listened his story open eyes. "Thee bi'st coom t' Razor along Devil's Way," said he amazement; "then thee bi'st plookiest young chap I have seen many day." "We must get back it, too, reach them," said Walter. "O ay; I be'ant afear'd t' Razor; I have crossed many time, I will take bit rope help chaps. We will take lantern, too. Do not afeared, sir, we will get  them right," he said, observing anxious excited Walter seemed be. "Come, then," said Walter, "quick, quick! I promised come back once. You shall well paid trouble." "Tut, tut," said man, "the pay's naught. Why, I would come dumb sheep danger, let alone brace lads like you." They set lantern, rope, food, Giles delighted quick elastic step young mountaineer. The lantern soon extinguished. It needed; though sun set, glorious full moon begun pour her broad flood silver radiance gloomy hills time reached Bardlyn rift. "There are not call _you_ cross again, sir," said man; "I will go myself, look young gentlemen." "O, let come, I must come!" said Walter. "The mist's quite now, it is easy moonlight I came; and, besides, take coil rope hand I will take hold end." "Well, you are right sort, mistake," said man. "God bless brave young heart! And, truth tell, I will glad ye me, say poor old Waul's ghost haunts here, 'ud fearsome night. I know there is One keeps good conscience, yet I will glad ye same." The moonlight flung every side mysterious gigantic shadows rocks hills, seeming glimmer ghastly hue fell struggled black depths untrodden rift; habit made Devil's Way seem nothing mountain shepherd, he protected Walter (who twined round his wrist one end rope) danger stumbling, effectually Walter protected ghostly fears. When reached broken piece, difference he made walk great caution, plant his feet deeply earth, bidding Walter follow traces he made, supporting firmly his hand. They got across much less time Walter occupied his first passage, reached Appenfell saw two boys standing dimly verge moonlit mist, rest Appenfell still wrapt, great cerecloth, snowy folds seething cloud. "Good heavens! those?" said Walter, pointing two shadowy gigantic figures also faced them. "O, _who_ those?" he asked wildly, alarm shepherd seized firmly he must fallen. "There, there--do not frighted," said Giles; "those be'ant ghosts, shadows mist. It is queer thing, I have seen often often hills, scholards told kind thing be'ant uncommon mountains." "What goose I horribly frightened," said Walter; "but I did not know spectres sort Appenfell. All right, Giles; go on." Till Walter shepherd taken last step Devil's Way side Appenfell, boys stood watching intense silence; sooner safe, Power Kenrick ran Walter, poured eager thanks, pressed his hands fervour affectionate gratitude. They felt his courage readiness had, risk his life, saved danger never lives experienced before. Already suffering hunger shuddering December air, limbs felt quite benumbed, teeth chattering lugubriously, faces blue pinched cold. They eagerly devoured brown bread potato-cake man brought, let Walter chafe little life shivering-bodies. By time fear sufficiently removed enable feel sort appreciation wild beauty scene, moonlight pierced left flitting scuds restless mist, right fell softly Bardlyn hill, making weird contrast tender brightness places fell, pitchy gloom hid depths rift, brooded undefined hollows precipices leaned. To return Appenfell (the experienced shepherd informed them) quite hopeless. In mist that, might last indefinite time, even _he_ would totally unable find his way. But warm satisfied food, confident safety, even enjoyed feeling adventure Giles tied together return across Devil's Way. First he tied rope round his waist, round Power's Kenrick's, finally, enough left go round Walter's waist, he tied end round his right arm. Thus fastened, danger tenfold diminished, wholly removed, two unaccustomed boys felt happy reliance nerve experience Giles Walter, front rear. It scene never forgot, four went step step moonlight along horrible ledge, safe other's help, awe-struck position, daring glance aside watch colossal grandeur shadows flung protruding rock. Power next Walter, reached spot beneath whiteness glinted rags fluttered wind, Walter, spite himself, could help glancing down, whispering "Look!" voice awe. Power unhappily look, boys Saint Winifred's familiar story shepherd's fate, even known man himself, Power seized nervous horror agitated Walter--grew dizzy, stumbled, slipped down, jerking Kenrick his knees sudden strain rope. Happily rope checked Power's fall, Kenrick's scream horror startled Giles, who, without losing his presence mind, instantly seized Kenrick arm seemed strong inflexible hammered iron, moment Walter, conscious his rashness, clutched hold Power's hand raised up. No word spoken, boys kept close guides, ready grasp tight first indication uneven footstep, almost lifted bodily every difficult slippery part. The time seemed long them, last reached Bardlyn hill safety, placed last step ever meant place narrow dizzy passage Razor's edge. And stopping looked back dangers passed--at Appenfell piled heaven white clouds; Bardlyn rift looming black abysses beneath them; thin broken line Devil's Way. They looked: "As man difficult short breath, Forespent toiling, 'scaped sea shore Turns perilous wide waste, stands At gaze." They stood silent till Power said, ejaculations intense emphasis, "Thank God!"--and pointing downwards shudder, "Oh, Walter!" again, "Thank God!"--which Walter Kenrick echoed; passed without another word. But two words, uttered, enough. The man, repaid sense he rendered important aid, greatly fascinated _manly_ bearing, entirely refused take money payment he done. "Nay, nay," he said; "we poor folks proud too, I will not none money, young gentlemen. But let tell you have narrow escape lives there, I do not doubt you will thank good God hearts night; you will say prayer old Giles, too, he will vally monies. So now, good-night you, young gentlemen, know way easy enough. And ever come way again, maybe you will come chat remembrance sake." "Thank you, Giles, will," said boys. "And since will not take money you will let give this," said Walter. "You _must_ let give this; it is worth much, it will show Walter Evson did not forget good turn us." And he forced old shepherd's acceptance handsome knife, several strong blades, he happened his pocket; Power Kenrick, rapid whispered consultation, promised bring days first-rate plaid serve slight reminder gratitude his ready kindness. Then shook hands many thanks, three boys, eager find sympathy perils deliverance, hastened Saint Winifred's, reached eight of the clock, absence beginning serious anxiety. They arrived arched gateway boys pouring evening chapel, every one doubtfully wondering become them, whether encountered serious mishap. When Famulus admitted them, fellows thronged round crowds, pouring ears succession eager questions. The tale Walter's daring act flew like wildfire school, one still retained particle ill-feeling, looked his character suspicion, evening replaced conviction noble gallant boy Walter among them, equalled merit one whose intimate friendship day deepened grateful knowledge him, human probability, owed preservation imminent overpowering peril. Even Somers, honour whose academic laurel whole holiday given, evening returned Cambridge, less hero either three thus climbed peak Appenfell braved serious adventure; far less crowned schoolboy admiration young boy thrice crossed recrossed Devil's Way, crossed first unaided full knowledge horrors, light winter evening dying away, hills around reeked like witch's caldron wintry mists. Walter, grateful he pat back warm pressure hand, told thoroughly joyously his doings appreciated, intoxicated enthusiasm boyish ovation. It indeed proud thing stand among four hundred schoolfellows, observed observers, greeted every side happy, smiling, admiring faces, every one pressing forward give friendly grasp, every one anxious claim form his acquaintance, many addressing kindliest greetings whose faces he hardly knew; deeper silent gratitude his chosen friends, manly sense something bravely rightly done, this. Yet something sweet. When admiration boys fairly kindled brightest, genial, generously hearty world. Few succeed winning it; he hero others manhood only, partial taste rich triumph experienced happiness boyhood hero among boys. Here let say one two people noticed Walter first saw evening. While numbers boys shaking hands him, he hardly saw recognised crowd mingled moonlight lamplight streamed court stood, Walter felt one squeeze he recognised valued. Looking among numerous faces, he saw Henderson greeting without word. No nonsense joke time, Walter noticed boy's lips trembling emotion, light tears his laughter-loving eyes. "Ah, Henderson!" said Walter, tone real regard pleasure truest sign pledge friendship, art counterfeit, "I am glad see again: Dubbs get on?" "All right, Walter," said Henderson; "but he is gone bed bad headache. Come see go bed. I know he would like say good-night." "Well done. Evson--well done indeed," remark Somers, he noticed Walter first time since scene private room. "Excellent, gallant little Walter," said Mr Percival, he passed by. Mr Paton, him, _said_ nothing, Walter knew he would expressed he caught his quiet approving smile, felt his hand rest moment, touch Christian blessing, his head. It happiness times loved, deserve love; happiest enjoy sorrow sin. But must escape ordeal prosperity, flattering words intoxicating fumes praise, soon can. Who would soon enervated tropical luxurious atmosphere? If dangerous, happily often he shall breathe heavy sweetness, far dangers shall mostly undergo. "Dr Lane wants you," said Famulus, time save tired boys remorseless questioners. They _went_ headmaster's house. He received stately yet sincere kindness; questioned occurrences day; warned future excursions liable accident winter ascent Appenfell; spoke friendly words them. For Kenrick Power he strong personal regard, latter especially feeling closely akin friendship affection. After gone he kept Walter behind, said, "I indeed sincerely rejoiced, Evson, meet circumstances widely different I saw last. I heard time past greatly improved, admirably doing. I glad opportunity assuring entirely succeeded winning back approbation esteem." Walter attended glistening eye, master shook hands he bowed silently withdrew. "Tea ordered Master Power's study," said footman, left master's house. CHAPTER SEVENTEEN. THE GOOD RESOLVE. "Am I brother's keeper?" Genesis chapter 4, verse 9. "Let us come see Dubbs tea," said Walter, rejoining two. "Henderson told he ill bed, poor fellow." They went cottage, detached rest school buildings, invalids removed, allowed go Daubeny's room; although he expecting visit he fallen asleep. They noticed worn weary expression upon his countenance, pleasant look him; although he ordinary-looking boy, somewhat heavy features, yet whatever beauty infused face honesty purpose innocence heart, found his, could speak Daubeny five minutes without attracted sense talking one whose character singularly free falsehood vanity, singularly unstained evil thoughts. "There lies one best worthiest fellows school," whispered Power, he raised candle look him. Low he spoken, sound awoke sleeper. He opened his eyes dreamily first, full recognition afterwards, said, "O, fellows, I am delighted set you; I saw Henderson last, he told had not come back, people beginning fear accident; I suppose that is reason I have dreaming uneasily, fancying I saw tumbling rift, kinds things." "Well, near it, Dubbs, but, thanks Walter, escaped right," said Power. Daubeny looked inquiringly. "We must tell to-morrow," said Power. "How feeling?" "O, I do not know; well, it is matter; I daresay I shall right soon." "Hush, young gentlemen," said nurse; "this will never do; ought not awoke Master Daubeny he sleeping nice." "Very sorry, nurse; good-night, Dubbs; hope you will right to-morrow," said they, adjourned Power's study. The gas lighted pretty little room, matron, regarding heroes, sent tempting tea. They ate almost silence, quite tired out. It seemed age since started morning Henderson Daubeny. Directly tea finished, Kenrick, exhausted fatigue excitement, fell asleep his chair, his head thrown back his lips parted. "There, I think that is sign ought going bed," said Walter, laughing he pointed him. "O no," said Power, "not yet; it is jolly sitting here; do not wake him, come draw chair next mine fire chat." Walter obeyed invitation, minutes sat gazing fire, reading faces embers, pursuing thoughts. Each happy other's presence; Walter, though year Power's junior, far school, delighted sense fully possessing, friendship promising gifted boy, treasure one world might well envied him. "It is strange day, has not it, Walter?" said Power last, laying his hand Walter's, looking him. "I shall never forget it; thrown new light one's time here." "Have I, Power? How? I did not know it." "Why, top Appenfell there, opened eyes fact I have living selfish life. I know I get credit conceited exclusive, sort thing; naturally shy, I thought better keep rather aloof towards I felt drawn. I see now," he said sadly, "that bottom mainly selfishness. Why, Walter, time I have here, I have not done much single boy you, new fellow, done little Eden one half-year. But there is time better yet; God's help I will try. I will give Eden run study to-morrow; there is plenty room, I will look little chap requires refuge destitute." "Thank you, Eden's sake," said Walter; "I am sure you will soon begin like him, he gets home you." "But that is worst it," continued Power; "so ever get home me. I suppose manner's awkward--or something; I would give anything make fellows friendly five minutes do. How manage it?" "I really do not know; I never think manner anything else. I suppose one feels least interest fellow, he probably feel interest me; so, somehow, I am best terms I care know." "Well, Ken I long talk left us, cross Devil's Way; I hope memory may make us three friends firm fast, tender true, long live. We horrible fright you, I suppose that, joined danger, gave solemn cast conversation; agreed three, friends, united silent resolution help others, especially new fellows young, much ever can, might great deal. Tell me, Walter, did not find hard thing first came, keep right among All sorts temptations?" "Yes, I did, Power, hard; I confess, too, I sometimes wondered one boy, though are, I see now, lots thoroughly good right fellows here, ever said one word, one thing help me." "It is wrong, wrong," said Power; "but first made see it. Walter, I shall pray to-night God, Who kept us safe, may teach help us live less ourselves. Who knows might school?" They sat short time thoughtful silence. Boys often talk openly together prayer religion, though perhaps even men common life. It right well so; would unnatural certainly harmful otherwise. And boys would probably never talked thus, common danger broken completely barriers conventional reserve. Never day allude sacred resolution; acted it, strove so, indeed unwaveringly, yet manful courage, strength pure, strong, beautiful unity heart purpose day cemented rest school-life. "But seem aim higher I do, Power," said Walter; "I certainly found lots wickedness going here, I never hoped change that. All I hoped save one two fellows cruelly bullied spoiled. We cannot alter wrong tone nearly fellows matters." "Yet," said Power, "there man, single man, great corrupted host, stood living dead, plague stayed." "Then rose Phinees prayed, plague ceased," whispered Walter himself. All farther conversation broken Kenrick, moment awoke great yawn, looking his watch, declared ought bed long ago. "Good-night, Ken; I hope shall sleep sound you," said Power. "Walter dream skeletons moonlit precipices, I bet," said Kenrick. "Not I, Ken; I am far tired. Good-night, both." Sleepy were, _two_ boys fall asleep night till poured passion full hearts, words earnest supplication future, trembling gratitude past. Two them--for Kenrick, fine points his character, entirely destitute sense religion, many points standard schoolboy rather Christian. When Walter reached his room, rest asleep, Eden. He sat his bed directly Walter entered, his eyes sparkling animation pleasure. "O Walter," he said, "I could not go sleep joy; Every one's praising skies. I proud you, good friends me." "Tush, Arty," said Walter smiling; "one would think I would done something great hear talk, whereas really nothing way. I meant taken us, I thought would far you." "Taken you, Kenrick, Power!" said Eden, opening his large eyes; "how kind you, Walter! fancy Power Kenrick walking me!" "Why not, Arty? Power's going ask to-morrow sit his study, learn lessons whenever like." "Power ask _me_!" "You! Why not?" "Why, he is _such_ swell." "Well, then, must try swell too." "No, no, Walter; I am ten times well I did, I shall never swell like Power," said child simply. "And I know it is doing, his. O, shall I ever learn thank pay me?" "By good brave little boy, Arty. Good-night, God bless you." "Good-night, Walter." CHAPTER EIGHTEEN. THE MARTYR-STUDENT. Impositique rogis juvenes ante ora parentum. Georgic Four, 1 71. The days followed, boys resumed regular routine school work, passed rapidly pleasantly--rapidly, long-expected Christmas holidays approaching; pleasantly, boys thoroughly occupied working subjects final examination. For Walter especially, days lighted warm glow popularity success. He aiming boyish eagerness win one laurel gaining first place his form, whenever he taking exercise, either school game ramble along his favourite cliffs sands, he generally found hard work Mr Percival's rooms, learning voluntary repetitions, going trial subjects Henderson, quite passed boundary line separated idle industrious boys. One morning Henderson came chuckling laughing himself. "So Power's taking leaf book, Walter. I declare he is becoming regular sociable grosbeak." "Sociable grosbeak? _do_ mean?" "O, do not know I am writing drama called `Sociable Grosbeaks,' Ken I introduced? I did not mean introduce Power, he was not gregarious enough; I _shall_ now, he shall prologise." "But he sociable now?" "Why, he is actually let one the--oh, I forgot, I must not call names-- well, he is given Eden run his study." "O yes; I knew that," said Walter smiling. "At first, funniest thing see together, shy; day two quite friends, may find Eden perched day Power's window-seat, grinding away his Greek verbs, happy king. Power helps his work, too. It will making little fellow. Already he is coming strong form." "Hurrah grosbeaks," said Henderson. "I _did_ mean chaff Power it, I will not, really kind him." "Yes, Percival let us sit here; I wish dear old Dubbs could trial-work us." "He is ill," said Henderson, looking serious; "_very_ ill, I am afraid. I saw to-day minute, he seemed weak talk." "Is he? poor fellow! I knew he staying out, I would notion anything dangerous." "I do not know _dangerous_, he is quite ill. Poor Daubeny! know patient good he is, yet even he cannot help sad falling ill now. You know he confirmed to-morrow week, he is afraid he will not well enough, put off." "Yes, he is mentioned his confirmation several times. Lots fellows going confirmed time--about hundred, I believe--but I do not suppose one thinks solemnly dear old Dubbs--unless, indeed, it is Power, also confirmed." The confirmation take place Sunday, candidates long engaged course preparation. The intellectual preparation carefully undertaken Dr Lane tutors boys; answer lips comparatively little value, except far tended guide, solemnise, concentrate preparation heart. In many approaching responsibility produced visible effect tenor outward life-- talked thought lightly before, elevate low standard schoolboy morality; _some_ hearts dreary formless chaos passion neglect first felt divine stirring brooding wings, spiritual temples time filled brightly Shechinah Presence, bore, golden letters new entablature, inscription, "Holiness Lord." To confirmation best boys, like Power Daubeny, looking forward, exaggerated romantic sentimentality, deep humility, manly exultation, earnest hope. They ready even anxious confirm baptismal vow, confirmed sacred strength enable future unswervingly fulfil it. Of young hearts grace God took early hold, reason religion ran together like warp woof frame web sweet exemplary life. Bound solemn public recognition of, adhesion to, Christian duty, would easier thenceforth confess Christ men--easier justice, love mercy, walk humbly God. "Do think would possible see Dubbs? I like see him," said Walter. "Let us ask Percival, he is next room; Dubbs well enough I know he would give anything see you." "Please, sir," said Walter, knocking admission door inner room, "do think Henderson I might go cottage see Daubeny?" "I do not know, Walter. But I want much see myself, Dr Keith let me, I will come enquire." Mr Percival walked two boys cottage, and, injunction stay long, admitted sick boy's bedside. At first, darkened room, saw nothing; Daubeny's voice--weak low, cheerful--at greeted them. "O, thank you, sir, coming see me. Hallo! Walter, Flip, too; I am glad see you--you sickroom again, Flip!" "We would come known might see you," said master. "How feeling, dear boy?" "Not well, sir; head aches sadly sometimes, I get confused." "Ah, Daubeny, it is overwork. Did not I entreat you, child, slacken bent bow little? You will wiser future, not?" "In future--O yes, sir; ever I get well, I am afraid," he said, faint smile, "that you will find stupider ever." "Stupid, boy! none us ever thought that. It stupid boys get head removes done last term two. I much enjoy talk you, Daubeny, I must not stay doctor says, I will leave two fellows you, give ten minutes--no longer--to tell school news." "In future wiser--in future," repeated Daubeny low voice twice; "ah, yes, late now. I do not think he knows ill I am, Walter. My mother's sent for; I expect her evening. I shall least live see her again." "O, do not," said Henderson, whose quick sensitive nature easily excited; "do not talk like that, Daubeny; cannot spare you; must stay sake." "Dear old fellow," said Daubeny, "you will nobody left chaff; spare easily enough," he laid his fevered hand kindly Henderson's, immediately turned his head brushed away tear. "O, do not cry," he added, pained tone voice, "I never meant make cry. I am quite happy, Flip." "O Daubeny! cannot get without you!" said Henderson. "Daubeny! I hardly know name," said sick boy, smiling. "No, Flip, let Dubbs, old--a nice heavy name suit owner; gave me, know, it is property, Flip, I hardly know now." "O Dubbs, I have plagued so," said Henderson, sobbing his heart would break; "I have never done anything teaze you, laugh you, you have always good patient me. Do forgive me." "Pooh!" said Daubeny, trying rally him. "Listen him, Walter; who would think Flip talking? Teased me, Flip?" he continued, Henderson still sobbed intervals, "not you! I always enjoyed chaff, I knew liked heart. You have kind me. Walter, I am glad I got know I--. It is pleasant see here. Give hand; no, Flip, let keep too; it is getting dark. I like here. I feel happy. I wish Power Ken would come too, I might see friends." "Good-night, Daubeny; I cannot stay, I must not stay," said Henderson; and, pressing his friend's hand, he hurried room indulge burst grief he could contain; for, his trifling nonsensical manner, Henderson warm susceptible feeling heart, though he always made Daubeny subject ridicule, he never particle ill-nature, felt him--dissimilar characters were--a fervent deep regard. "Look I gone, Walter," said Daubeny sadly, he left room. "He dear good fellow, easily led. Poor Flip; he is immensely changed better since came, Walter." "I fond along," said Walter; "he full laughter fun, he is good all. But, Dubbs, desponding; shall yet many pleasant days." "I do not know; perhaps so, God wills. I young. I like stay little longer sunshine. Walter, I like stay _you_. I love more, I think, one except Power," he spoke, quiet tear rolled slowly Daubeny's face. Walter pressed his hand. "You cannot think I pitied you, Walter, accident Paton's manuscript. When fellows cutting you, abusing you, heart used bleed you; used go looking miserable, much chances life over. I am afraid I little then, I _would_ done anything. I felt I could given right-hand." "But, Dubbs, first spoke happened, first was not ashamed walk me. You cannot think grateful I felt it; rolled cold weight me. It like stretching saving hand one drowning; every one knew good fellow _you_ were, countenance worth everything then." "You really felt so?" said Daubeny, brightening up, faint flush rested moment his pale face; "O Walter, makes happy hear say so." There silence, and, Walter's hand still his, he fell sweet sleep, smile upon his face. When he quite asleep, Walter gently removed his hand, smoothed his pillow, looked affectionately moment, stole silently room. "How leave him?" asked Henderson eagerly, Walter rejoined Mr Percival's room. "Sleeping soundly. I hope good. I know much cared him, Flip." "That is I always made butt," said Henderson, remorsefully; "but I did not really think he minded it, I would not done so. I hardly knew I liked so. It confounded shame worry I always doing. Conceited donkey I was, I always trying make seem stupid; yet I could stood cap hand. O Walter, I hope he going die!" "O no, I hope not; do not miserable thought teasing him, Flip; fun, he never wounded word yours. Remember he used tell he time laughing you, him. Come turn shore, let us take Power Ken us." "Sociable grosbeaks, again," said Henderson, laughing midst his sorrow. "Yes," said Walter; "never mind. There birds sort all." They found Eden his feet up, his hands round his knees, window-seat, perfectly his ease, chattering Power like young jackdaw. A thrill pleasure passed Walter's heart glance showed well his proposal succeeded. Power evidently reason repent his kindness, Eden looked like bright happy child he been, ever case since he come Saint Winifred's. He clean neat dress, shadows fear guilt begun darken his young face chased away. Power readily joined stroll along shore, listened affectionate sympathy account Daubeny. "What made ill?" he asked. "There is doubt that," answered Walter; "it is overwork brought tendency brain fever." "I afraid so, Walter," Power repeated half fine lines Byron Kirke White-- "So struck eagle stretched upon plain, No rolling clouds soar again, Viewed his feather fatal dart, And winged barb quivered his heart; Keen his pangs, keener far feel. He nursed pinion impelled steel; While plumage warmed his nest, Drank last life blood his bleeding breast." "What grand verses!" said Walter. "Poor, poor Daubeny!" "I have never one feeling myself," said Power, "and feeling almost like reverence. I hope trust he will well enough to-morrow week. I always looked forward kneeling next confirmed." "All, loved him, Power," said Henderson, "because tastes like his. But I owe great deal him--more I ever tell you. I do not feel I could tell now, he lies ill, poor fellow. He saved vigorous efforts throw away. But I gone devil long, long ago. I _very_ near once." He sighed, walked violet margent evening waves, he offered silence earnest prayer Daubeny might live. The blind old poet would said winds carried prayer away scattered it. But winds scatter, waves drown, immortal spirit one true prayer. Unanswered _may_ be--but scattered fruitless, _not_! CHAPTER NINETEEN. THE SCHOOL-BELL. To thought death terrible, Having hold life; More sudden lifting latch; Nought step open air, Out tent already luminous With light shines transparent fold. Longfellow's Golden Legend. "I have got good piece news you, Master Daubeny," said kind old school-nurse. "What it? mother here?" he said eagerly. "O! let her come see me." She door, next moment his arms round her neck long embrace. "Darling, darling mother," he exclaimed, "now I shall happy, come. Nay, must not cry, mother," he said, he felt one her fast flowing tears upon his forehead; "you have come help bearing up." "Dearest Johnny," she said, "I trust yet God spare widow's son; He Who raised son widow Nain pity us." "His ways ours, mother dear; I think I shall recover. My past life hangs like far-off picture already; I lie look almost mine, mind quite peace; sometimes head confused." "God's done, Johnny," sobbed poor lady. "But I think I live, taken me." "Taken--but ever, mother," he said, looking her face. "O Johnny, _why, why_ spare yourself, work less? It work killed you." "Only fell heavier boys. They got quickly, I clever, cost duty. I tried it, mother dear, God helped me. All well is. O head, head!" "You must rest, darling. My visit talk excited you. Try go sleep." "Then sit there, mother, opposite me, I may see I wake." She kissed his aching brow, sat down, he composed rest. She lady fifty, bands silver hair smoothed her calm forehead, appearance unlike her son. But something sweet matronly her look, impossible see her without feeling respect honour her due. And she sat there, bedside, looking upon her son, boy light her life; she knew he dying--she knew he fading away her eyes. Yet sweet noble resignation her anguish; deep genuine spirit submission heaven, perfect faith God's love, whatever might issue, every prayer she breathed, clasped hands, streaming eyes, moving lips, she gazed upon his face. He might appear dull heavy others, her he dear beyond thought; she lose him. In her inmost heart she knew she _must_ suffer great pang; God taking Himself son good true her, affectionate, sweet-tempered, unselfish, even his gentle quiet infancy he never his conduct caused her moment's pain. She long looking forward strong upright manhood follow pure boyhood; dear boy destined staff her declining years; _her_ hands close his eyes last long sleep, she pass alone overshadowing rocks close around valley human life. God help mother's heart must pass scenes like this! Poor Daubeny could sleep. Brain fever usually accompanied delirium, he turned restlessly upon his pillow, his mind began wander away days scenes. "Stupid, sir? yes, I know I am, I cannot help it; I have really done best. I five of the clock morning, trying, trying hard learn repetition. Indeed, indeed, I am idle, sir. I will try duty I can. O Power, I wish I like you; learn quickly, never get abused I all." And poor boy fancied sitting gas-lamp passage he often done, trying master one his repetition lessons, repeating lines fast he used do-- "`Hac arte Pollux et vagus Hercules, Enisus--enisus arces--enisus arces attigit igneas, Quos inter Augustus--' "How _does_ go on? "`Hac arte Pollux et vagus Hercules, Enisus arces attigit igneas, attigit igneas, Quos inter Augustus recumbens--'" "Oh, _does_ come next?" he stopped expression pain his face, pressing his hands tight his brow. "Do not go repetition, Johnny, dear," said poor mother. "I am sure know enough now." "O, no! yet, mother; I shall turned, I know I shall to-morrow, makes angry; he will call idle incorrigible, kinds things." And he began again-- "`Sed quid Typhoeus aut validus Mimas, Aut quid minaci Porphyrion statu, Quid Rhoetus--Rhoetus--quid Rhoetus--' "Oh, I shall break here, I know I shall," he burst tears. "It is good trying help me, Power, I _can't_ learn it." "Leave to-night least, Johnny," said his mother, tone anguish; "you learn rest to-morrow. Oh, shall I do?" she asked, turning nurse; "I cannot bear hear go like this." "Be comforted, madam," said nurse, wiping away her tears. "He is dear good lamb, he will come hisself soon afore he goes off." "_Must_ he die, then?" she asked, trembling every limb. "Hush, good lady! never know God may please His mercy. We must bow His gracious will, madam, knows well, I do not doubt. He is fitter die many grown man is, poor child, that is blessing. I wish though he was not repeating heathenish Latin." But Daubeny's voice still humming fragments Horace lines, sometimes eager concentration, pauses parts his memory failed, he would grow distressed anxious-- "`Quid Rhoetus... quid Rhoetus evulsisque truncis, Enceladus.' "Oh, I _cannot_ learn this; I think I am getting stupid every day. Enceladus--" "If love me, Johnny, give to-night, that is darling boy," said his mother. "But, mother, it is _duty_ know it; would not fail duty, mother dear, would you? Why, told persevere, things might. Well, I leave to-night." Then, still unconscious he doing, boy got prayed, evident he _had_ done many time, God would strengthen his memory quicken his powers, enable his duty like man. It inexpressibly touching see he knelt there--thin, pale, emaciated, shadow his former self, kneeling his delirium offer his old accustomed prayer. And he got bed again, although his mind still wandered, he much calmer, new direction seemed given his thoughts. The prayer fallen like dew his aching soul. He fancied Power's study, many Sunday two boys used sit, often learnt read favourite hymns. Fragments hymns he repeating, dwelling words evident sense pleasure belief-- "`A noble army--men boys, The matron maid, Around Saviour's throne rejoice, In robes light arrayed. _They_ climbed steep ascent heaven, 'Mid peril, toil, pain; O God, _us_ may strength given, To follow train.' "Is not beautiful, Power? "`And upward wing. Cleaving sky, Sun, moon, stars forgot, Upwards I fly; Still song shall be, Nearer, God, Thee, Nearer Thee.'" And he murmured soothed tone voice verses, lines "Jerusalem Golden," "O closer walk God," "Rock Ages," wearied brain last found repose, Daubeny fell asleep. He lingered till end week. On Saturday he ceased delirious, lucid interval began precedes death. It he earnestly entreated allowed see school friends whose names often his lips--Power, Walter, Henderson. The boys, daily eagerly inquired him, entered feeling trembling solemnity room sickness. The near presence death filled indescribable awe, felt desolate approaching loss friend loved well. "I sent say good-bye," he said, smiling sweetly. "You must cry grieve me. I happier I ever felt before. Good-bye, Walter. It is long, long, long time, ever. Good-bye, dear old Flip--naughty fellow cry so, I happy; I gone, Flip, think sometimes, talks we have together, take side manfully God Christ. Good-bye, Power, best friend; meant confirmed together, know, God ordered otherwise." And he whispered low-- "`Lord shall come? come yet again? Thy children ask one blessing more; To come alone, When life, death, time over; Then, then, come, O Lord, _Confirmed heaven--confirmed Thee_.' "O Power, line fills hope joy; think I dead," his voice trembled emotion he murmured, "`Confirmed heaven--confirmed Thee.' I am afraid I am weak talk more. O, long, long good-bye be--for years, years, years; think gone room shall never meet life again, I shall never hear pleasant voices. O Flip, make cry crying so. It is hard say, must said last. Good-bye, God bless you, heart." He laid his hand heads bent him, mere whispering last "Good-bye," turned away his face, made pillow wet his warm tears. The sound his mother's sobs attracted him. "Ah, mother, darling, alone now; stay till I die. I tired." "I feared visit would excite much, child." "O no, mother; I could not bear die without seeing them, I loved much. Mother, sing _little_--sing favourite hymn." She began low, sweet voice,-- "My God, Father, I stray, Far home life's rough way, O teach heart say, Thy done, Thy be--" She stopped, sobs choked her voice. "I sorry I cannot, Johnny. But I cannot bear think soon must part." "Only short time, mother, short time. I said long time now, _now_ looks quite short, I shall God. I see clearly. Do remember lines-- "`The soul's dark cottage, battered decayed, Let Us new light chinks time made.' "How true are! Oh, darling mother, very, good always me, I pay heart's whole love." He pressed upon her lips long, long kiss, said, "Good-night, darling mother. I falling asleep, I think." His arms relaxed loving embrace, glided her shoulder; his head fell back; light faded his soft gentle eyes, he asleep. Rightly he said "asleep"--the long sleep sweetest happiest knows waking here; long sweet sleep evil dreams disturb; sleep eyes open upon light immortality, weary heart rests upon bosom God. Yes, Daubeny fallen asleep. God help thee, widowed mother; daily endearments, looks living affection, light boy's presence, thee thy home more. There lies human body thy son; his soul white-robed, redeemed, innumerable multitude Paradise God. For hours, till light faded darkness, young life faded death, she sat fixed deep grief finds utterance, knows alleviation, little consciousness save dead presence, pang benumbed her aching heart. And outside rang sound games health, murmur boy-voices came her forlorn ear. There stream life flashing joyously gloriously sunshine, here, darkened room, sunk sands, lost shadow dark boughs. But she Christian; sweet voices memory, conscience, hope, promise whispered her her loneliness angel messages, her heart melted tears came, she knelt took dead hand her son hers, said, her sobs, her tear-stained eyes turned heaven, "O God, teach understand Thy will." And night great bell church Saint Winifred's tolled sound death; and, mingled stroke stroke, long, tremulous, thrilling notes echoed silent buildings, rang thin clear bell Saint Winifred's School. The tones school-bell usually heard summoned boys lessons quick hurried beatings. How different slow occasional notes--each note trembling undisturbed vibrations quivered long upon air--with told one least will not warn, hurry possible longer, boundless leisure now! There strange pulse emotion hearts listening boys, sound two passing bells struck upon ears sat evening work, told soul schoolfellow passed away, God's voice summoned His young servant His side. "You hear it, Henderson?" said Walter, sat next him. "Yes," answered Henderson awe-struck voice, "Daubeny dead." The rest evening two boys sat silent motionless, full solemn thoughts never forgotten. And rest evening deep church-bell tolled, shrill school-bell tolling it, shivered wintry night air tremulous message soul Daubeny passed away. CHAPTER TWENTY. FAREWELL. "Be day weary day long At last ringeth even-song." There serious look faces boys thronged chapel next morning confirmation service. It beautiful sight see subdued yet noble air, full humility hope, wherewith many youthful candidates passed along aisle, knelt altar, clasped hands bowed heads awaited touch hands blessed. As young soldiers Christ knelt meekly places, resolving pure earnest hearts fight manfully His service, praying child-like faith aid felt need, indeed spectacle recall ideal virtuous Christian boyhood, force upon minds many contrast presented familiar spectacle boyhood coarse, defiant, brutal, ignorant yet conceited, young years old disobedience, insolence, sin. When good bishop, course his address, alluded Daubeny's death, throughout chapel instantly silence felt--that deep, unbroken hush expectation emotion always produces indescribable effect. "There one," he said, "who confirmed to-day, here. He passed away us; he never present earthly confirmation; he `confirmed heaven--confirmed God.' I hear, I rejoice hear, confirmation he indeed prepared, he looked forward his latest thoughts. I hear he pre-eminent among piety, purity, amiability his life character, his death caused intense earnestness his desire use aright talents God entrusted him. O! death one young yet fit die far happier longest prosperous sinful lives. Be sobered saddened it. It proof God's merciful tender love one schoolfellows taken clear quiet dawn noble holy life, scarlet blossom precocious deadly sin. Be saddened therefore loss, sobered warning. The fair, sweet, purple flower youth falls fades, young brethren, sweeping scythe death, less surely withered grass age. O! ready--be ready girded loins lighted lamp-- obey summons God. Who knows us next, soon, bell death may toll? Be ye therefore ready, know day hour voice may call you!" The loss well-known companion respected many loved-- crowding memories school-life--the still small voice every conscience, gave strange meaning force bishop's simple words. As listened, many wept silence, cheeks Walter, Power, Henderson, tears fell like summer rain. In evening Walter seated thoughtfully fire Power's study, Power writing table, stopping occasionally wipe his glistening eyes. "He earliest friend here," he said Walter, almost apologetically, he hastily brushed drop fallen blurred paper him. "But I know selfish sorry," he added, he pushed paper towards Walter. "May I read this, Power?" asked Walter. "Yes, like," he drew his chair his, Walter read Power's small clear handwriting-- A Farewell. Never more! Like dream one awaketh Vanishing away; Like billow breaketh Scattered spray; Like meteor's paling ray, Such man, he can;-- Nothing fair stay. Sorrow staineth, man complaineth. Sin remaineth ever more; Like wake upon shore Soundeth ever chorus Of spirits gone us, "Ye shall meet us, ye shall greet us In sweet homes earth, places birth, Never again, never more!" So sing, sweetly dying Faints message voices, Dying like distant murmur, mighty host rejoices, But echoes replying melancholy sighing Never again! never more! Far-away Far far-away homes wherein dwell, We lost them, cost Many tear, many fear When God forbade stay; But sorrow, morrow Ceased dawning lighter, brighter day; And _our_ bliss shall certain, death's awful curtain. Drawn darkness mortal life away, To happy souls revealeth darkly concealeth, Yielding glory heaven's eternal ray. Far far-away homes wherein dwell, But know blest, ever rest, And utter hearts, "It well." "May I keep them, Power?" he asked, looking up. "Do, Walter, remembrance to-day." "And may I make one change, bishop's sermon suggested?" "By means," said Power; Walter, taking pencil, added line "Nothing fair stay," words, Power afterwards copied, writing top, "In memoriam, J.D." "Nothing fair stay But Death's sharp scythe sweeping, We remember 'mid weeping, That Father-hand keeping Every vernal bloom falleth underneath chilly sway. And though earthly flowers may perish There buds His hand cherish And things unseen Eternal--these never pass away; Where angels shout Hosanna, Where ground dewed manna, These remain await us homes heaven ay!" The lines Walter's desk; he values tears fallen them, blurred neatness fine clear handwriting. On following Tuesday boys saw dead body friend. The face poor Daubeny looked singularly beautiful placid lines death, innocent faces do. It first time seen corpse; Walter touched cold cheek, placed spray evergreen rigid hand, he almost overpowered awful sense sad sweet mystery death. "It God taken Himself," said Mrs Daubeny, she watched emotion. "I shall parted long. He left remembrance himself, dear boys, value them, I know, poor child's sake, his widowed mother's thanks loved him." For he chosen, he died, one his prized possessions. To Power he left his desk; Henderson, his microscope; Kenrick, little gold pencil-case; Walter, treasure he deeply valued, richly-bound Bible, he left many memorials manner his days spent; he marked many rules standard his life, words hope sustained his gentle noble mind. The next day he buried; boys his house, known best, followed grave. They standing two lines along court, plumed hearse stood cottage door. Just moment rest boys began flock school, lessons over. Each he came caught sight hearse, plumes waving whispering sea-wind, double line mourners; each, seeing it, stood he was, perfect silence. Their numbers increased moment, till boys masters alike there; sudden impulse stopped standing first saw hearse, stood still without word. The scene strangely impressive accidental spontaneous. Meanwhile, coffin carried downstairs, placed hearse, moved slowly across court line bareheaded motionless mourners. It thus Daubeny left Saint Winifred's, passed Norman arch; till he passed through, boys stood fixed places, like group statues usually noisy court. He buried churchyard tower grand old church. It lovely spot; torrent murmured near it; shadows great mountains fell upon it; stood sacred silence memory-haunted field, heard far-off solemn monotone everlasting sea. There laid him, stream life, checked moment, flashed turbulent sparkling waves. Ah me!--yet sigh merciful provision, causes best us, die, leaves slight transient ripple waters, moment flow smoothly before? Mrs Daubeny left Saint Winifred's evening; her carriage looked strange her son's boxes possessions piled it. Who would ever use cricket-bat skates again? Power Walter shook hands her door she start; last moment, Henderson came running something, he put carriage seat without word. It bird-cage, containing little favourite canary, he Daubeny often fed. CHAPTER TWENTY ONE. KENRICK'S HOME. Yonder lies village looks quiet small, And yet bubbles like city gossip scandal spite. Tennyson. _Maud_. It last evening. The boys assembled great schoolroom hear result examination. The masters caps gowns seated round Dr Lane dais centre room; every one eager know places boys taken, would win various form prizes. Dr Lane began bottom school, _last_ boy form, interest proceedings kept culminating grand climax. The first name interest us Eden's, Walter Power watching anxiously see he would come his form. Power kindly coaching his work expected high; much _his_ surprise gratification, his name read _third_. Jones Harpour were, natural, last respective forms. At length Dr Lane got Walter's form. Last one came Howard Tracy, listening fine superiority whole announcement. Anthony Franklin far him. Henderson expected tenth; tenth name, ninth, eighth, read, he mentioned; his heart beating fast, he almost fancied must mistake; no; Dr Lane read on. "Seventh, Grey; "Sixth, Mackworth; "Fifth, Whalley; "Fourth, Henderson;" Walter hardly done patting back, congratulating him, Dr Lane read-- "Third, Manners; "Second, Carlton; "_First_"--the Doctor always read word "first" peculiar emphasis, brought name boy attained distinction great empressement--"_First, Evson_." Whereupon Henderson's turn pat back, he vigorously; so, his enthusiasm began clap--a demonstration ran like wildfire ranks boys, Dr Lane could raise his voice secure silence--for approbation occasions great schoolroom _selon regle_--our young hero received regular ovation. For since day Appenfell, Walter favourite school, glad follow Henderson his irregular applause. There intoxicating sweetness popularity. Could Walter help keenly enjoying general regard thus, defiant rules, broke his honour spontaneous acclamations? Dr Lane's stern "Silence!" heard uproar, soon reduced boys order, he proceeded list. Kenrick read first his form, Power, matter course, first second fifth, although form he youngest boy. Somers came head school, examination well seniority standing; his case, too, impulse cheer strong resisted. The head school was, however, tacitly excepted general rule, Dr Lane smiled he listened clapping, showed Somers regarded esteem honour boys, spite his cold manners stern regime. "Hurrah Sociable Grosbeaks!" said Henderson, boys streamed room. "Why, carry us! And fancy fourth! Why, I am magnificent swell, without ever known it. You look out, Master Walter, I shall scrimmage laurels." "Good," said Walter. "Meanwhile, come help pack laurels box. And home! Hurrah!" And he began sing exquisite air of: "Domum, domum, dulce domum, Dulce, dulce, dulce domum;" Power Henderson joined heartily; Kenrick walked silence. Next day boys scattered every direction various homes. It need said Walter passed happy holidays Christmas time. Power came spent fortnight him; let every boy cheerful affectionate home imagine blithely days passed by. Power made universal favourite, always unselfish, always merry, throwing heartily every amusement Evsons proposed. He mutually sorry time came part. From Semlyn Lake, Walter's home, Fuzby, Kenrick's home, change great indeed; yet I must take reader short time, return noisy often troubled precincts Saint Winifred's School. Before Power came stay Evsons, Walter, his father's full permission, written ask Kenrick join time, answer he got reply-- "My Dear Walter,--I cannot tell much letter tempted me. I like come; I would give _anything_ come see you. To Power place Semlyn must be--O Walter, almost makes envious think there. But I cannot come, I will tell frankly reason. I cannot afford, rather I mean mother cannot afford, necessary travelling expenses. I look you, Walter, best school friend, I may well say _very, very_ poor. If I could even get walking way, going third-class rest, I would jump chance, but--. Lucky fellow, _you_ know nothing _res angusta domi_. "You must amused name place, Fuzby-le-Mud. What charming prospects name opens, not? I assure name fits place exactly. My goodness! I hate place. You will ask live here? Simply _must_. Some misanthropic relation left us house live in, saves rent. "Yet, me, I think I could happy even here. I do not venture ask you. First all, could not make one-tenth part comfortable home; secondly, is not ghost amusement here, came, you would go back Saint Winifred's fit blue devils, I always do; thirdly, change Semlyn Fuzby-le-Mud would like walking Elysian fields asphodel meadows, mere _borboros_ old Edwards would say. So I _don't_ ask you; yet could come--why, day would marked white dull calendar of--Your ever affectionate-- "Harry Kenrick." As Fuzby lay nearly route Saint Winifred's, Walter, grieved his friend doomed dull holidays, determined, Mr Evson's leave, pay three-days' visit his way school. Accordingly, towards close holidays, hopeful, joyous, affectionate farewell home, he started Fuzby, he accompany Kenrick back school; visit fraught, turned out, evil consequences, one he never afterwards ceased look back upon regret. The railroad, leaving far behind glorious hills Semlyn, passes country flatter uninteresting every mile, finds fairly committed fens. Nothing dreary dykes, muddy straight, guarded ghosts suicidal pollards, rows dreary desolate mills, occur break blank grey monotony landscape. Walter looking window curious eyes, he wondering life conditions could like, train uttered despairing scream, reached station porter announced Fuzby-le-Mud. Walter jumped down, his hand instantly seized Kenrick warm affectionate grasp. "So you are really here, Walter. I hardly believe it. I half repent brought place; I _so_ dull." "I shall enjoy exceedingly, Ken, you. Shall I give portmanteau man take village?" "O, no; here is a--well, I may well call _cart_ once--to take in. The curate lent me, he calls pony-carriage; is, see, nothing less cart. I hope will not ashamed ride it." "I think not," said Walter gaily, mounting curious little oblong wooden vehicle. "It is not far," said Kenrick, "and I daresay do not know one here; will not matter." "Pooh! Ken, I minded nonsense." Indeed, Walter would thought twice conveyance, Kenrick harped upon much, seemed much ashamed it, mortified obliged use it. "Shall I drive?" asked Walter. "Drive? Why, pony stone blind, scraggy scarecrow, there is much driving him. Fancy aristocratic Power, Saint Winifred's fellow saw us! Why, would supply Henderson jokes six weeks," said Kenrick, getting touching old pony his whip. Both he Walter wholly unconscious equipage _had_ seen, contemptuously scrutinised one schoolfellows. Unknown Walter, Jones train; and, long stare pony-chaise, flung back his seat indulge long guffaw, anticipating malicious amusement he feel retailing Saint Winifred's description Kenrick's horse carriage. Petty malignity main feature Jones's mind. "That Fuzby," said Kenrick laconically, pointing straggling village lights beginning glimmer; "and I wish buried twenty thousand fathoms sea." Ungracious speech may seem, cannot wondered at. A single muddy road runs Fuzby. Except along road--muddy rutty winter, dusty rutty summer--no walk had. The fields less impassable ditches bogs. Kenrick christened "The Dreary Swamp." Nothing shape view found anywhere, barely single flower deign grow. The air unhealthy moisture, element perfection earth. All this, Kenrick's father--who curate village--had fancied would least endurable man upheld strong sense duty. So he married, received gift house village, he took thither his young beautiful bride, intending live work something better could obtained. He right. Over mere disadvantages situation he might easily triumphed, he might secured there, different circumstances, fair share happiness, lies localities live. But making his calculation he always assumed would easy get inhabitants Fuzby; lay his mistake. The Vicar Fuzby, non-resident pluralist, appeared rare intervals receive adoration his flock never refused one wealthy. His curate, slender income, came share respect. On contrary, whole population assumed right patronise him, interfere him, annoy thwart him. There Fuzby one squire--a rich farmer, coarse, ignorant, brutal. This man, richest person parish, generally carried everything his way, among attempts imitate absurdities his superiors, ordered sexton never cease ringing church-bell, however late, he his family taken seats. A Sundays Mr Kenrick's arrival bell still ringing eight minutes time morning service, sending desire sexton leave off, he received message that-- "Mr Hugginson had not come yet." "I congregation kept waiting Mr Hugginson one else," said curate. "O zurr, zervus haint begun afore Muster Hugginson come ten year." "Then sooner Mr Hugginson made understand hours service altered his convenience better. Let bell cease immediately." But sexton, dogged, bovine, bullet-headed labourer, took notice whatever injunction, although Mr Kenrick went reading-desk, continued lustily ring bell whole Hugginson family, furious dignity thus insulted, sailed church beginning psalms. Next morning Mr Kenrick turned sexton his place, received wrathful visit Mr Hugginson, who, pouring torrent disgusting abuse, got scarlet forehead, shook his stick Mr Kenrick's face, flung his poverty his teeth, left cottage, vowing eternal vengeance. With went Fuzby population. It would long tell various little causes led Mr Kenrick's unpopularity among them. Every clergyman similarly circumstanced may conjecture himself; resolved mainly fact Mr Kenrick abler, wiser, purer, better, Christian, they. His thoughts theirs, his ways ways. "He daily beauty his life That made ugly." And so, pass briefly lightly, unpleasant subject, Fuzby brimming concentrated meanness petty malignant natures, united one sole object snubbing worrying unhappy curate. To live among like living cloud poisonous flies. If Dante known Fuzby-le-Mud, he could found really generous noble spirit detestable unendurable inferno muddy English village. The chief characteristic Fuzby pestilential spirit gossip. There lying scandal, malicious whisper, thrive rank luxuriance mean atmosphere, which, time, starved every great high-minded wish. There circumstance minute calumny could insert venomous claw. Mr Kenrick one exemplary, generous, pure-minded men; his fault quickness temper. His noble character, his conciliatory manners, his cultivated mind, his Christian forbearance, vain. He poor, he could toady: two unpardonable sins; he, true man, moved like angel among set inferior beings. For time he struggled on. He tried mind lies told him. What him, instance, took advantage his hasty language declare he constant habit swearing, he knew even boyhood oath ever crossed his lips? What uneducated boors, feeble ignorance, tried constantly entrap something called unorthodox, twist his words semblance fancied heresy? It painful opposed vilified every one he helped, whose interests, pity, he endeavoured forward. But still he bore on, he struggled on, till _denouement_ came. It worth entering various schemes invented his annoyance, last unfortunate, although purely accidental, discrepancy detected accounts one parish charities Mr Kenrick officially managed. Mr Hugginson seized his long-looked-for opportunity: he went round parish, got large number his creatures among congregation affirm signatures Mr Kenrick behaved dishonestly. This memorial he sent bishop, disseminated among clergy malicious assiduity. At next clerical meeting Mr Kenrick found coldly received. Compelled self-defence take legal proceedings squire, he found involved heavy expenses. He his because, his character cleared; jury, attending technicalities case, conceiving enough _prima facie_ evidence justify Mr Hugginson's proceedings, left side pay costs. These costs swallowed whole poor curate's private resources, also involved debt. The agony, suspense, shame, cruel sense oppression injustice, bore crushing weight his weakened health. He could tolerate merest breath suspicion, however false, pass his fair honourable name. He pined away atrocious calumny; poisoned life-springs happiness, destroyed his peace mind ever. This young man, flower youth--a man might leader teacher men--a man gracious presence high power--died broken heart. He died broken heart, Fuzby built his conspicuous tomb, she would crocodile tears his pious memory. Truly, one said, black stains lie athwart white conventionalities common life! This happened little Kenrick eight years old; he never forgot spectacle his poor father's heartbreaking misery last year his life. He never forgot how, year, sorrow anxiety aged his father's face, silvered his hair, young he was, premature white, quenched his spirits, often he would take his little boy his knee, look upon long silence, child cried intensity long, mournful, hopeless gaze, tears he saw slowly coursing his father's careworn furrowed cheeks. Ever since boy walked among Fuzby people open scorn defiance, among whose slanders done death father he proudly loved. In spite his mother's wishes, he would stoop pay even semblance courtesy. No wonder he hated Fuzby perfect hatred, his home miserable home. Yet, one _could_ made happy home place, would Mrs Kenrick. Never, I think, purer, fairer, sweeter soul live earth, one like angels heaven. The winning grace her manners, simple sweetness her address, pathetic beauty sadness her face, would her, _had_ her, place Fuzby, love admiration her due. "She mind envy could call fair." But Fuzby, dominant faction Hugginson, small vulgar-minded sets always tried brow-beat poor, particularly birth breeding gentle, she found nothing insulting coldness, still insulting patronage. When first she heard marriage-bells clang old church tower her home, walked side her young husband, glad lovely bride, she looked forward many happy years. With _him_, rate, seemed place could miserable. Poor lady! her life one long martyrdom, hard bear made part small annoyances, petty mortifications, little recurring incessant bitternesses. And now, seven years her widowhood, she gained calmer serener atmosphere, she raised _possibility_ humiliation dwarfed natures malicious hearts midst she lived. They could hurt her feelings, could embitter her days longer. To hopes pleasures earth she bidden farewell. Still young, still beautiful, she reached full maturity Christian life, meekly bearing load scorn, disappointment, poverty, looking rest remaineth people God. In her lonely home, friend Fuzby she could turn counsel consolation, shut sorrows her lonely heart, she often mused slight sources, _little sins_ others, her misery sprung; she marvelled mystery man man "the sorest, surest ill." Truly, _is_ strange thought! O! pitiable that, though death, want, sin enough, must add sum human miseries despising, neglecting, injuring others. We wound harsh words, dishonour coarse judgments, grieve untender pride, souls Christ died; wound deeply, grieve irreparably, noblest best. The one tie bound her earth her orphan son--her hope, her pride; her affections centred beautiful boy. Now, I writing romance, I course represent yearning mother's affection reciprocated warmth passion boy's heart. But so. Harry Kenrick indeed love his mother; he would borne anything rather see her suffer great pain; his manners often cold, his conduct wilful thoughtless. He love her--perhaps child love his parents--with _abandon_ intensity wherewith she loved him. The fact is, blight lay upon Kenrick whenever he home--the Fuzby blight he called it. He hated place much, he hated people much, he felt annoyances situation keen fretful sensibility, Fuzby, even though his mother, he never happy. Even her society could make detestation he unnaturally regarded village inhabitants. At school he bright, warm-hearted, full life; home he seemed draw she will reserve coldness; deep unspoken trial gentle mother's heart she could make home happy boy she fondly loved, even her he seemed indifferent; his manners--since he school learned differently boys circumstanced, untold pleasures centred word "home"--were her always shy silent, appeared sometimes almost harsh. I wish I could represent otherwise; things often truly represented books; common well tragic case? Not even her son could Mrs Kenrick look happiness; even his society brought trials almost hard bear his absence caused. Yet mother could brought her child wisely, tenderly, undivided devoted care. Harry's _heart_ true could she looked it; Fuzby cold, repellent manner fell like mildew. And Mrs Kenrick wept silence, she thought--though true--that even her son love her, least love her she hoped he would. It last bitter drop overflowing cup pleased God she called upon drink. The boys drove door little cottage. It stood garden, garden overlooked Fuzbeians sides, offered attractions, otherwise small plain. They greeted Mrs Kenrick's soft pleasant voice. "Well, dear Harry, I delighted brought back friend." Harry's mind pre-occupied poverty-stricken aspect he thought house must present his friend, he answer her, said Walter-- "Well, Walter, hut inhabit. We one girl, servant. I will carry box. I pretty nearly everything clean shoes." Mrs Kenrick's eyes filled sad tears bitter words; she checked greet Walter, advanced shook her hand cordially, manner respectfully affectionate, he her heart once. "Harry yet learned," she said playfully, "that poverty thing ashamed of; I sure, Walter--forgive using name boy made familiar me--that mind little inconveniences short stay us." "Oh, no, Mrs Kenrick," said Walter; "to greatest possible enjoyment." "I wish would not flap poverty every one's face, mother," said Kenrick, almost angrily, Walter barely left room. "O Harry, Harry," said Mrs Kenrick, speaking sadly, "you surely forget, dear boy, mother speaking. And I mentioned poverty first? O Harry, learn contented dispensations God? Believe me, dearest, might make poverty happy wealth, would eyes see blessings involves." The boy turned away impatiently, he ran upstairs rejoin his friend, lady sat deep sigh her work. It long ere Kenrick learnt much his conduct blame; long after, his mother dead, he reminded painfully scene, he accidentally found her handwriting extract one her favourite authors-- "It reserved age perceive blessedness another kind poverty; voluntary proud, accepted submissive; clear-sighted triumphant, subdued patient; partly patient tenderness--of God's will; partly patient blindness--of man's oppression; laborious thoughtful, innocent conscious; much experienced sorrow hopeful-- waiting peaceful darkness unconceived dawn; yet without sweet, complete, untainted happiness, like intermittent notes birds daybreak, first gleams heaven's amber eastern grey. Such poverty reserved age honour afflicted; reserved age come honour spare." CHAPTER TWENTY TWO. BIRDS OF A FEATHER. What, man! I know them, yea, And weigh even utmost scruple; Scrambling, out-facing, fashion-monging boys, That lie, cog, flout, deprave, slander. Much Ado Nothing, act 5, scene 1. Walter could help hearing part conversation, he pained surprised Kenrick, he regarded fine character, show his worst side home, speak act thus unkindly one he deeply bound love reverence. And he even surprised he went downstairs looked calm face his friend's mother, lovely, gentle, resigned, felt charm manners which, natural grace sweetness, might she would lustre court. All he could show his manner Mrs Kenrick affection respect he regarded her. When he hinted Kenrick, delicately distantly he could, he thought his manner his mother rather brusque, Kenrick reddened rather angrily, replied, "Ah, it is well talk; do not live Fuzby." "Yet I have enjoyed visit much, Ken; cannot think much I love mother." "Thank you, Walter, saying so. But would like _live always_ place?" "If I I best make happy." "Make _happy_!" said Kenrick; he turned away he muttered something making silk purse sow's ear. Soon he told Walter circumstances his father's life recently related. When three days boys started Saint Winifred's. They drove station pony-chaise described, accompanied, Kenrick's will, his mother. She bore bravely she bade good-bye, knowing undemonstrative character boys, seeing merriest mood. She knew, too, gaiety natural: world lay _them_, bright seductive yet, shadow across light; she Harry he her. He hopes, another home, ties; remembering she tried grieve he leave her light heart. But she turned away platform train started, taking she held dearest world, she walked back lonely home nothing faith--for even hope--to brighten it, quiet tears flowed fast fair face beneath her veil. Yet she crossed her lonely threshold her thoughts even herself, carried her wings prayer throne mercy beloved boy she separated nearly five long months. The widowed mother wept; boy's spirits rose he drew closer hills sea, told Saint Winifred's near. He talked happily Walter coming half--eager ambition, hope, high spirits, fine resolutions. He clapped his hands pleasure reached top Bardlyn Hill caught sight school buildings. Having long distance travel among late arrivals, great gate stood Henderson Power ready greet boys came coach. Among Eden Bliss. "Ah, Eden," said Henderson, "I have writing poem you-- "I am shrimp, I am shrimp diminutive size, Inspect antennae look eyes; Quick, quick, feel quick, cannot see I am shrimp, I am shrimp, eaten tea?" "And who is this?--why," he said clasping his hands throwing his eyes mock rapture, "this indeed Bliss!" "I will lick you, Flip," said Bliss, good-humoured tone usual, he hit him. "I think I have heard observation before," said Henderson, dodging away. "Ah, Walter, do, dear old fellow? I hope you are sitting throne health, reclining canopy well-organised brain." "More are, Flip," said Walter laughing. "You seem madder ever." "That he is," said Power; "since his return he is made average fifteen thousand bad puns. You ought grateful, though, he I got coffee going study. Come along; Familiar see luggage right." "Yes; I shall make bold bring shrimp tea," said Henderson, seizing hold Eden. "All right. I meant ask you, Eden," said Power, shaking little boy affectionately hand; "have enjoyed holidays?" "Not much," said Eden. "You are looking bright I like," said Power; "never mind; did not enjoy holidays must enjoy half." "That I shall. I hope, Walter, you will dormitory still. What shall I you are not?" "O, how is be, Flip?" asked Walter; "you said you would try get us put together one dormitory. That would awfully jolly. I do not want leave you, Eden, would like moved too; I cannot bear Harpour lot." "I have partly managed partly failed," said Henderson. "You shrimp still stay rest set Number 10, vacant bed I got put too." "Hurrah!" said Walter Eden once; "that is capital." "Let see," said Walter; "there Jones Harpour--brutes certainly them; Cradock--well, he is rather bargee, he is altogether bad; Anthony, Franklin, far jollier used be; indeed I like old Franklin much; Eden shall get famously." The first days term passed pleasantly. The masters met boys kindliest spirit, boys, fresh home sweet influences home still playing them, begin reweave ravelled threads evil school tradition. They good terms themselves, full good resolutions, cheerful, happy. All boys got removes. Walter double remove his friend Mr Percival. Kenrick second fifth, Power, young he was, attained upper fifth, stands next dignity monitors sixth. The first Sunday term glorious day early spring, boys, according custom, scattered various groups grounds Saint Winifred's School. The favourite place resort broad green field back buildings, shaded noble trees, half encircled bend river. Here, fine Sunday, dinner afternoon school, sure find great majority boys walking arm arm twos threes, sitting books willow trunks overhung stream, stretched full length upon grass, lazily learning Scripture repetition. It sweet spot pleasant time; Walter generally preferred his beloved seashore; afternoon he sitting talking Power, Eden, perched top piece rock close by, kept murmuring his afternoon lesson. The conversation two boys turned chiefly holidays over, Power asking Walter his visit Kenrick's house. "How enjoy visit, Walter?" "Very much things. Mrs Kenrick sweetest lady ever saw." "But Ken always abusing Fuzby--is not name?" "Yes; is not particularly jolly place, certainly, he does not make best it; he makes his mind detest it." "Why?" "O, I do not know. They did not treat his father well. His father curate place." "As far I have seen, Fuzby is not singular respect. It is easy thing places poor clergyman keep good terms his people." "Yes; Ken's father seem abominably treated." And Walter proceeded tell Power parts Mr Kenrick's history Kenrick told him. When he finished story he observed Eden shut his book listening intently. "Hallo, Arty," said Walter, "I did not mean hear." "Did not you? I am sorry. I really did not know meant talking secrets, were not talking particularly low." "The noise waves prevents that. But never mind; I do not suppose it is secret. Ken never told mention it. Only, course, must not tell one, know, clearly is not thing talked about." "No," said Eden; "I will not mention it, course. So people unhappy homes well me," he added low tone. "What, is not home happy, Arty?" asked Power. Eden shook his head. "It used be, holidays mamma married again. She married Colonel Braemar--and I _can't bear_ him." The words said energetically leave doubt he grounds dislike; Power said-- "Hush, Arty, must try like him. Are sure know Rep. perfectly?" "Yes." "Then let us take turn till bell rings." While conversation going shore, different scene enacted Croft, field called I described. It happened Jones, one his set, named Mackworth, walking Croft one direction, Kenrick Whalley, one his friends, pacing avenue opposite direction, four boys passed every five minutes. The first time met, Kenrick could help noticing Jones Mackworth nudged derisively he passed, looked glance unmistakably impudent. This rather surprised him, though he bad terms both. Kenrick forgotten grossly Jones bullied he new boy, he risen sphere Jones could dare bully impunity. He high school well aware Jones would nearly much afraid touch he always annoy one his size strength; Kenrick never hesitated show Jones quiet quite measureless contempt he felt his malice meanness. Mackworth bully another stamp; he rather clever fellow, set aristocrat strength second cousin baronet, studied "De Brett's Peerage," dressed faultlessly Tracy himself, affected times studious politeness manner. He good deal abroad, he constantly adopted airs graces fashionable person, boys felicitously named French Varnish. But Mackworth dangerous enemy, he one biting tongues whole school, things he enjoyed making young boy wince his cutting words. When Kenrick came school, his wardrobe, work Fuzbeian artists, well worn--for his mother poor give new clothes--but also somewhat odd cut; accordingly first words Mackworth ever addressed Kenrick were-- "You new fellow, what is father?" "My father dead," said Kenrick low tone. "Then _was_ he?" "He curate Fuzby." "Curate he; slashing trade that," brutal reply. "Curate Fuzby? sure is not Fusty?" Kenrick looked strange glowing eyes, which, far disconcerting Mackworth, made chuckle success his taunt. He determined exercise lancet his tongue again, let fresh blood possible. "Well, glare-eyes! did not like remark?" Kenrick made answer, Mackworth continued-- "What charity-boy left his off-cast clothes? May I ask jacket intended serve also looking-glass? custom part country wear breeches knees?" There corrosive malice speech intense Kenrick never saw Mackworth without recalling shame anguish caused. Fresh home, full quick sensibility, feeling ridicule great keenness, Kenrick much pained words even anger. He hung his head slunk away. For days after, until, his earnest entreaty, his mother incurred much privation afford new better suit, he hardly dared lift his face. He fancied mark ridicule, sense shabbiness poverty gone far crush his spirit. After time he recovered, never since day he deigned speak Mackworth single word. He surprised, therefore, obtrusive impertinence two fellows, next he passed them, he surveyed head foot haughty indignant stare. The moment he heard burst laugh, begin talking loudly. "It rummiest vehicle ever saw," he heard Jones say; "a cart, I assure you--nothing less, drawn scraggiest scarecrow blind horse." He caught distance lessened, he heard Jones bubbling stupid giggle remark Mackworth's _glare-eyes_ drawn _blind_ horse. "How rude fellows are, Ken," said Whalley; "what mean it?" "Dogs!" said Kenrick, stamping angrily, his face scarlet rage. "If they are trying annoy you, Ken," said Whalley, gentle, popular boy, "do not give triumph seeing succeed. They are Varnish White-Feather--we know _they're_ like." "Dogs!" said Kenrick again; "I like pitch them." "Let us leave them, go sit river, Ken." "No, Whalley. I am sure mean insult me, I want hear how, why." There difficulty this, Jones his ally approaching, Jones talking purposely loud. "I never could bear fellow; gives airs." "Yes; fancy going meet his friends hay-waggon! What start! He! he! he!" "It is impudence low fellow like that..." Kenrick lost words, for, passed, Jones lowered his voice; he heard, plainly, words "father" "dishonest parson"--the rest he could supply fatal facility. For half instant he stood paralysed, his eyes burning fury, his face pale ashes. The next second he sprang upon Jones, seized hands collar his coat, shook him, flung violently ground, kicked his hat, fallen struggle, straight river. "What deuce mean that?" asked Jones, picking up. "I will give you--fifth-form, fifth-form--the best licking ever had." "You will presume lay upon tip finger," said Whalley, quite big Jones, fond Kenrick. "Not flinging kicking hat water?" "No, Jones," said Whalley, quietly. "I do not know talking about, clearly meant insult him, manner." "What is row? what is up?" said number boys, began throng round. "Only plebeian splutter rage well-bred friend there," said Mackworth, pointing contemptuously Kenrick, stood dilated nostrils, still heaving rage. "But about?" "Heaven knows _apropos_ nothing." "You are liar," said Kenrick impetuously. "You know told lies insulted me; say again, I will again." "Only try," said Jones, surly tone. "Insulted you?" said Mackworth bland accents. "We talking dishonest parson, far I remember. Pray, dishonest parson?" "You would better take care," said Kenrick fierce energy. "Take care what? We did not ask _you_ listen conversation; listeners hear no--" "Bosh!" interposed Whalley; "you know talking top voices, could not help hearing you." "And then? May not talk loud like?--I assure you, word honour," he said, turning group around them, "we did not even mention Kenrick's name. We merely talking certain dishonest parson rode hay-carts, fellow sprang Jones like tiger-cat. I am sure, he is objection talking unpleasant people will not his hearing," said Mackworth, excess venomous politeness. "French Varnish," said Whalley, honest contempt, moved beyond his will not indignation, though he understand Kenrick's anger. "I wonder Kenrick even condescend notice fellows Jones say. Come along, Ken; know think two;" and, putting his arm Kenrick's, he almost dragged scene, Jones Mackworth (conscious single boy would condemn conduct infamous understood it) sorry move another direction. But Whalley taken Kenrick quiet place river side, asked "what made furious?" he returned answer, hiding his face his hands. He indeed cruelly insulted, wounded his tenderest sensibilities; he felt his best affections wantonly violently lacerated. It made miserable he ever felt before, he could tolerate wretched thought his father's sad history, probably distorted form, been, means other, bruited among unsympathising hearers, made common property school. He knew well indeed natural delicacy feeling would prevent boy, except Jones Mackworth, ever alluding even remotest way. But know shameful charge broken his father's heart, brought temporary suspicion dishonour his name, gall wormwood him. _Yet, possible means could, become known them_? Kenrick knew one way only. He thought Jones said. "A cart blind horse--ah! I see; _only one person_ could told that. So, _Walter Evson_, amuse Jones making fun poor, ridiculing saw house; good laugh you have dormitory, I have doubt." Kenrick know Jones seen window railway-carriage, he visiting aunt great distance, he heard particulars Mr Kenrick's history. He clutched angrily conclusion, _Walter_ betrayed him, turned derision. Naturally passionate, growing wilful years opening boyhood without father's wise control, he stop inquire, leapt false obstinate inference. "It must so; clearly _is_ so," he thought; "yet I could believed him;" he burst flood bitter angry tears. The fact Kenrick, though he would hardly admitted even himself, particularly ready mood take offence. He observed Walter disapproved his manner towards his mother, his sensitive pride already ruffled fact Walter exercised moral courage pointing out, though delicate modest way, brusquerie he reprobated. At time he said little, reality made very, angry; he jealous enough fancy he stood second only, even third, Walter's estimation, Power Henderson deposed place he held his chief friend; Walter also usurped _his_ old place _their_ affections. This displeased greatly, he one could contentedly take second place. He could excellent companion manly upright Whalley; his close intimacy he rather hoped pique Walter, show his society indispensable his happiness. But Walter's open generous mind quite incapable understanding unworthy motive, feelings far better trained Kenrick, he never felt slightest qualm small jealousy. "Never mind, dear fellow," said Whalley, patting back; "why care much two _such_ fellows White-feather Varnish try impudent. I should not care snap finger anything could say." "It is not that, Whalley, is not that," said Kenrick proudly, drying his tears. "But fellows know things hinting at? Only one person ever heard them, he must betrayed laugh behind back. It is _that_ makes miserable." "But mean?" "The excellent Evson," said Kenrick bitterly. "And mark me, Whalley, I will never speak again." "_Evson_," said Whalley, "I do not believe he is fellow it. Are certain?" "Quite. No one else could know things." "But surely you will ask first?" "It is use," answered Kenrick, gloomily; "but I _will_, order he may understand I found out." CHAPTER TWENTY THREE. A BROKEN FRIENDSHIP. Everard, Everard, truest, God future, Time show, Never I stoop defence excuses-- If despise me--be so! But, Everard, still (for I love you) This end prayer shall be-- Never may sternly treated, Never judged judge me.--F. Kenrick happen meet Walter remainder Sunday, Walter chiefly sitting Mr Percival's room, next day, still nursing smouldering fire his anger, he determined get first opportunity he could meeting him, order he might tax his supposed false friendship breach confidence. Accordingly, school next day, he went Whalley look playground. Walter walking Henderson, never dreaming anything unpleasant likely happen. Henderson first catch sight them, he never saw Whalley without chaffing ridiculous way other--for Whalley's charming good humour made capital subject joke--he began, might expected, sing-- "O Whalley, Whalley bank, And Whalley, Whalley brae, And Whalley, Whalley, yon burnside--" whereupon his song interrupted Whalley's giving chase him, end till he led dance half round school buildings, ground left clear Kenrick's expostulations. Walter came cordially usual, stopped short surprise, he caught scornful lowering expression his friend's face; Kenrick speak once, he took hand, said, "Why, Ken, what is matter?" Kenrick coldly withdrew his hand. "Evson, I came ask if--whether--if you have telling fellows me; I told father?" As Walter instantly remembered he mentioned story Power, he could say "No," explain. "Telling fellows father?" he repeated; "I did not know--" "Please, I do not want excuses. If have not, it is easy say `No'; _have_, I want say `Yes.'" "But never told I was not to--" "Yes no?" said Kenrick, impatient gesture. "Well, I suppose I must say `Yes,' then; hear explain. I mentioned to--" "That is enough, thank you. I do not want hear more. I do not want know mentioned to;" Kenrick turned short his heel, began walk off. "But hear me, Ken," said Walter eagerly, walking him, laying his hand his shoulder. "My name's Kenrick," said he, shaking Walter's hand. "You may apologise like; even I shall not speak again." "I nothing apologise for. I told--" "I tell I do not care `only' told. It is `only' school. And it is `only' time you have behaved dishonourably." "I do not understand you," said Walter, rapidly getting great passion Kenrick. "Betraying confidence _almost_ bad breaking open desks, burning--" Such taunt, coming Kenrick, base cruel, he knew so. "Thank allusion," said Walter; "I deserve it, I own, I am surprised, Kenrick, _you_, others; make it. _That_, I admit, act sin strange folly I must always feel humiliated, implore forgiven. And every generous person _has_ long ago forgiven forgotten it. But _this_ case, were not silly rage, I could show I have done nothing wrong. Only I know would not listen _now_, I shall not condescend--" "_Condescend_! I like that," said Kenrick, interrupting scornful laugh, made Walter's blood tingle. "_You_ condescend _me_, forsooth." Higher words might ensued, moment Henderson, still pursued Whalley, came running up, seeing something gone wrong, he said Kenrick-- "Hallo, Damon! Pythias saying you?" Kenrick vouchsafed answer, turning his back them, went abruptly. "He is angry you, Evson," said Whalley, "because he thinks you have telling Jones lot his family secrets." "I have done nothing whatever kind," said Walter, indignantly. "I admit I thoughtlessly mention Power; one overheard me. It never occurred moment Kenrick would mind. You know I would not dream speaking ill-naturedly, fellow was not blind rage I could explained five minutes." "If merely mentioned Power, I am sure Kenrick would much mind. I will tell he is cooler," said Whalley. "As like, Whalley; Kenrick business suspect shameful way, abuse me, treat I quite beneath his notice, cast old faults teeth," answered Walter, deep vexation. "Let find truth himself. He can, he takes trouble." Both friends thoroughly angry other; imagined deeply wronged other, them, his irritation, used strong unguarded expressions lost nothing repetition. Thus "rift difference" cleft deeper deeper them; and, chiefly Kenrick's pride precipitancy, disagreement might first easily adjusted became serious, threatened become permanent, quarrel. "Power, repeat I told Kenrick one?" asked Walter, next time he met him. "Repeat it?" said Power; "why, Walter, suppose I would? What take for?" "All right, Power; I know could not thing; Kenrick declares I have spread school, abusing like pickpocket." Walter told circumstances case, Power, displeased Walter's sake, sorry two real friends separated he could regard venial error Walter's part, advised write note Kenrick explain true facts case again. "But what is use, Power?" said Walter; "he would listen explanation, said many hard things he could." "Yes, passion. He will sorry directly he is calm; know generous fellow he is. You forgive them, I am sure, Walter, win pleasure first make advance." Walter, little struggle his resentment, wrote note, gave Whalley give Kenrick next time he saw him. It ran follows:-- "My dear Kenrick,--I think little hard upon me. Who told Jones anything home secrets I do not know. He _could_ learnt me. It is true I mention something father Power I talking affectionate way you. I am sorry this, I never dreamt would make angry. Power last person repeat thing. Pray forgive me, believe always be-- "Your affectionate friend, Walter Evson." Kenrick's first impulse receiving note seek Walter earliest occasion, "make up" sincerest heartiest way he could. But suddenly sight Jones Mackworth vividly reminded his proud sensitive nature scene caused acute pain. He see Jones _could_ learnt vehicle, rate, without Walter laughed one. Instead seeking explanation, thinking evil hoping things, he gave reins his anger suspicion, wrote:-- "I bound believe explanation far goes. But I reason _know_ _something_ must passed admit said. I astonished treated unworthily. I would done you. I try forget unpleasant business; sense I sign again. "Your affectionate friend. H. Kenrick." Walter expected cold, ungracious reply. When Whalley gave Kenrick's note he tore open eagerly, anticipating frank renewal former friendship; red spot rose his cheeks he saw insinuation he told whole truth, he tore note, he indignantly determined take step towards reconciliation. Yet he thought many pleasant hours spent together, firmly whole Kenrick stood his troubles, lovable boy he really was, Walter could grieve difference. He found often yearning old terms Kenrick; he felt heart he still loved well; days he stifled pride, wrote:-- "Dear Ken,--Is possible believe word? If still feel doubt I said, come see Power's study. I sure I would convince five minutes must mistake; I done wrong, _think_ I done wrong, Ken, I will apologise sincerely without pride reserve. I miss society much, I still shall be, whatever may think whatever may say me.--Yours affectionately, W.E." As he naturally wish third person know passing he entrust note one, placed leaves Herodotus he knew Kenrick would use next school. He barely put boy wanted Herodotus happened come classroom, seeing Kenrick's lying table, coolly walked it, manner boys, regardless inconvenience owner might put. As boy reading different part Herodotus Kenrick reading, Walter's note lay leaves placed, unnoticed. When book done with, boy forgot it, left school, where, kicking days unowned, consigned, stray volumes, miscellaneous cupboard, lay undisturbed years. Kenrick supposed lost, one "bagged" it; and, unknown Walter, his note never reached hands destined. In vain he waited reply; vain he looked word sign show Kenrick received his letter. But Kenrick still met perfect silence, averted looks; Walter, surprised his obstinate unkindness, thought he _could_ nothing disabuse his false impression, ready forego friendship every honourable means he endeavoured retain. Poor Kenrick! he felt much Walter he lost one his truest pleasant friends, he, too, often yearned old intercourse them. Even his best friends, Power, Henderson, Whalley, thought wrong; consequence coolness rose him. He felt thoroughly miserable, know turn; yet none less he ostentatiously abstained making slightest overture Walter; whereas two boys might enjoyed together many happy hours, felt continual embarrassment obliged meet frequently awkward silence, apparent unconsciousness other's presence. This silent annoyance recurred continually hours day. They threw away golden opportunity smoothing brightening schoolboy years. It sad since true friends few, slight differences, trivial misunderstandings, separate years. If man's penitence past follies humble sincere, his crimes failings may well buried generous oblivion; but, alas! his friends, his household, often _the last_ forgive forget. Too often condone fault till years unhappiness disappointment intervened; till wounds inflicted cicatrised; till sinner's loneliness taught look human sympathy; till he old, sorrowful, heartbroken, near Great White Throne, expect joy human friendship, consolation human love. Twice chance throw friends situations reconciliation would easy. Once, school assembled hear result composition prizes, found accidentally seated, one side Power. The mottoes envelopes sent successful exercises always read envelope opened, one prizes many competitors, punning motto, Ezousiazo, told Power achieved brilliant success. The Great Hall always scene triumphs happy boy. Both Walter Kenrick turned moment congratulate him, Walter seizing his right-hand Kenrick his left. Power, thanking warm congratulations, grasped hands, drew towards other. Kenrick aware he meant, his heart fluttered he hoped regain lost friend; moment Walter's attention happened attracted Eden, who, though sitting benches off, wished telegraph his congratulations Power. Unfortunately, therefore, Walter turned his head away, he knew Kenrick's hand actually touching his. He perceive Power's kind intention opportunity lost; Kenrick, misinterpreting his conduct, flushed sudden pride, hastily withdrawn his hand. On second occasion Walter gone hill churchyard, side pleasant stile, overshadowed aged elms, he often sat reading enjoying breeze view. It suddenly occurred he would look Daubeny's grave, see stone yet put up. He found raised, he sorrowfully reading inscription, footstep roused his mournful recollections. A glance showed Kenrick approaching, evidently purpose. He came slowly grave read epitaph. Their eyes met friendly gaze. A sudden impulse reconciliation seized both, verge shaking hands, three boys came sauntering churchyard--one ill-omened Jones. The association jarred minds, turning away without word walked home different directions. CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR. EDEN'S TROUBLES. Et tibi quae Samios diduxit littera ramos, Surgentem dextro monstravit limite callem. Pers. three 56. There Samian Y's instructive make, Pointed road thy doubtful foot take; There warned thy raw yet unpractised youth, To tread rising right-hand path truth. Brewster. They went home different directions, morally paths henceforth widely diverse. The Pythagoreans chose letter Y symbol good evil life. The broad, sloping, almost perpendicular left-hand stroke apt emblem facile downward descent Avernus; precipitous narrow right-hand stroke aptly presents slippery, uphillward struggle virtuous course I remember seen, child, another similar emblem impressed much. On one side picture snail slowly creeping steep path; stag rushed bounded unrestrained sheer proclivities wide darkening hill. Improvement ever slow difficult; degeneracy often startling rapid. From henceforth, shall occasion see hereafter, Walter progressing strength strength, adding faith virtue, virtue temperance, temperance knowledge, knowledge brotherly kindness, brotherly kindness charity-- "Springing crystal step crystal step Of bright air--;" poor Kenrick gradually descending deeper deeper darkness despair. Yet he loved Walter, sighed old intimacy, he daily abusing his character affecting scorn his conduct. In short, change came Kenrick. There always little worm root his admiration affection Walter. It jealousy. He like hear praised loudly his friends schoolfellows; besides he vexed Walter, Henderson, Power, closely allied him. He struggled successfully unworthy feelings long Walter his friend, he allowed seek quarrel grew tremendous luxuriance. And he thoroughly wrong, obstinate persisting misunderstand misrepresent his former friend, gradually, his pertinacity injustice, he alienated regard his chosen companions. Even Whalley grew cool towards him. He look elsewhere associates, unhappily he looked wrong direction. Meanwhile Walter, although he constantly grieved loss friend, otherwise happy. The boys Saint Winifred's overworked; enough work stimulate oppress them, Walter's work grew promising every day. He fond praise, Mr Percival, he always took care praise obviate danger conceit, scant his approbation men are. His warm generous appreciation encouraged rewarded Walter's exertions, he quite "star" his form. Many boys well Mr Percival. There bright cheerful emulation among all, took especial pains exercises, Mr Percival varied every possible way, call imagination fancy, exercise reason understanding, test powers attention research. His method successful often real pleasure look exercises his form, he adopted one plan keeping boys' interest them, eminently useful. All _best_ exercises, attained positive excellence, sent Dr Lane; end half-year, number, printed opposite boy's name, showed often he thus "sent good." If one fortnight _four_ separate exercises sent up, form obtained, proof industry, remission hour's work, honour could never cheaply highly prized. Now two three times Walter's unusually brilliant exercises chief contribution towards winning remitted hours, success caused double happiness, necessarily made general favourite form. Henderson (who got single remove beginning term, worked hard his new form he succeeded his purpose winning remove _during_ term, division Walter) his best earn distinction, he succeeded exercise happened English one, subject gave opportunity his sense ludicrous. He generally contrived introduce purely fictitious "Eastern Apologue" he called it; he rarely managed keep correct Oriental colouring, his combinations Sultans, Tchokadars, Odaliques, white bears, sometimes inexpressibly absurd Mr Percival, avoid fits laughter, obliged look his exercises alone. Nor his eccentricities always confined his English themes; his Latin verses occasionally less extraordinary, one set, suicide Ajax, last lines consisted fragmentary words interspersed numerous stars--a phenomenon he explained Mr Percival gravest manner possible, saying voice Ajax interrupted sobs! Happy his work, Walter less happy his play. The glorious mid-day bathes hard sparkling yellow sands sea smooth blue heaven, clear transparent glass--the long afternoons green sunny cricket field--the strolls mountains, lazy readings tree fragrant fir-groves-- invigorated him, gave his face health, his heart mirth, told innocent life vigorous frame. But must supposed he escaped troubles his own, his first trouble rose kind boyish protectorate he established little Eden's interests. His rescue Eden clutches bad lot one Walter's proudest gladdest reminiscences. Instead moping miserable lonely, rapidly developing rank harvest evil seeds his tormentors tried plant his young heart, Eden gayest gay. Secure annoyances possessing refuge Power's study, certainty Walter's help, he soon began assert his position among boys his age standing. No longer crushed intimidated bullying bad companions, he lively, happy, universally liked, never happier Walter Power admitted him, constantly did, society. Harpour Jones, hatred Walter, especial reason keep Eden far could subjection, addition general propensity bully domineer. They care torment Walter present, him, spite hostility, felt wise maintain armed neutrality. But whenever Walter absent, felt safe. None boys dormitory interfered except Henderson, his interposition, though always generous, morally physically weaker Walter's. He would not, indeed, allow positive cruelty, he thoughtful stable enough see duty interfering prevent hardly less tolerable persecutions. It happened game cricket Walter accident received blow knee cricket-ball bowled Franklin, tremendously hard swift bowler. The hurt caused severe he ordered Dr Keith sleep ground-floor cottage fortnight, order save exertion running many stairs. The opportunity prolonged absence maliciously seized tyrants Number 10; Eden bore far manfully he done old days. He quite different, far braver little fellow, thanks Walter, he term before; and, looking forward his friend's speedy return, he determined bear his troubles without saying word them. He far bullied period Henderson knew of, threats commands he coerced given Henderson's absence, he allowed sit half hour later form below. For instance, Eden ordered never look book finish learning his lessons bedroom; he strictly forbidden get second bell rang morning. If he disobeyed orders, he soused water, pelted shoes, beaten slippers, whole he found better content lose place form, get impositions missing chapel, attempt brave hindrances. When, however, he late two mornings running, Henderson got secret him, entreated Harpour Jones abandon cruelty, throwing hints refused, he would take measures get stopped one monitors. If Eden plucky enough embrace his natural right obtaining protection one his schoolfellows sixth, he would efficiently defended. Appealing monitor order secure immunity disgraceful wholly intolerable bullying different thing telling master; although worst boys tried get traditionally regarded unmitigated form sneaking, yet public opinion best part school would found justify it. But two bullies knew Eden would never heart venture appeal; although desisted particular practice Henderson's request, knew he wavering character, fond popularity _easily_ induced make his open enemies. If Eden told Walter, he knew Walter would sheltered unkindness hazards; he thoroughly grateful child, wish get Walter difficulties his account. So, schoolboy phrase, nothing left "grin bear it;" he heroically did, earnestly longing Walter's return dormitory golden age. But his trials yet. Is human nature instinctive cruelty? That it--_when ill-trained_--an absorbing selfishness, total absence tenderness delicate consideration, abundantly obvious. But besides this, often astonishing almost incredible tendency take positive pleasure infliction pain. Now happens Jones Harpour bad boys, I shown already, worst sense word, yet real _enjoyment_ felt making little Eden's life miserable inexplicable phenomenon. One would thought mere sight little boy, his tender age; his delicate look, his extreme gentleness courtesy manner, mute appealing glance his blue eyes, would sufficed protect wanton outrage. It _did_ suffice boys; anything, added zest piquancy persecutions two big bullies. Reader, ever "taken prisoner?" say, ever awaked sweet sleep feeling intolerable agony right toe, finding caused somebody tied string tight round without waking you, pulling said string his force? If not, congratulate thereupon, accept assurance one undergone it, pain caused process absolutely excruciating. It pain made Eden start scream one nights I speak of, cry rose intensity he grew fully awake sensation. "Hallo! what is row, Eden?" said Henderson, starting bed; child could continue his screams, Henderson, springing bed stumbled string, instantly (for trick familiar one) knew done. As quick thought he seized string his right-hand and, pulling _towards_ Eden, slackened horrible tension it, his left-hand he rapidly took knife his coat pocket cut cord two. Jones Harpour, tittering success machination, standing string hands outside door passage, sudden jerk showed string severed. "I will tell is," said Henderson them, deliberate emphasis, "I do not care lick telling truth, two couple greatest brutes school." "What is matter, Flip?" asked Franklin, his bed, drowsy tone. "Matter! two _brutes_," said Henderson, strong indignation, "have taking poor little Eden prisoner, hurting awfully." "What confounded shame!" said Franklin Anthony one voice; they, too, though sturdy fellows, experience bullies earlier school days; late, following Walter's example, always energetically opposed maltreatment Eden. "Draw mild, three, we will kick you," said Harpour. "But will not draw mild," said Franklin; "it is quite true; Jones _are_ brutes bully poor little fellow so. He never hurt you." "What uppish lot nips are," said Harpour; "it is fellow Evson's doing. Hang me, I do not take you;" he advanced slipper his hand towards Franklin. "Touch dare," said Henderson; "if Anthony I stick him; and, Cradock, you will see fair play, will not you?" "Pooh," said Cradock. "I am asleep. Fight yourselves." "Never mind little fools, Harpour," said Jones; "they are beneath notice. Besides, it is time turn sleep." For Jones earned his soubriquet always showing particularly large white feather chance fray. "Phew, Jones; none us would give much _you_," said Henderson contemptuously. "_Little_ fools, indeed! You know well _you_ dare not lay finger least us, whether we are beneath notice no. An ostrich big bird, white feathers chiefly use helping run away." He went Eden's bedside, child still sobbing pain, evidently great state nervous agitation. "Never mind, Eden," he said, kind soothing voice; "think it; will not let take prisoner again." And he spoke he took his place Eden's side, looked angry defiance two bullies. "Those fellows hurt so," said Eden, apologetic tone, bravely trying check his tears. "Oh, I wish Evson would come back." "He coming back night two; his knee nearly well. I have not helped enough, poor little fellow. I am sorry. I say, _brutes_," he continued, raising his voice, "next time bully Eden, I will tell Somers sure fate." "Tell away then," jeered Harpour; "better go tell shoes wear out." "Ah, you will change tone, Master Harpour, you have well whopped," answered Henderson. "I like see Somers one else whop me," said Harpour, extremely "Ercles vein"; "by Jove! Lane should not it." "Oh, indeed!" "I will `oh, indeed,' you!" said Harpour, getting bed; Cradock interfered, seized Harpour his brawny arm, said-- "There, that is badgering enough one night. Do let fellow go sleep." Harpour got bed again, Henderson, reassuring Eden he molested, followed his example. But, half fright half pain, poor boy lay awake night, he _did_ fall asleep he constantly started troubled dreams. Next morning two parties dormitory would hardly speak other. They rose daggers drawn, highest dudgeon. Henderson glad Anthony Franklin openly espoused right side, pleased _anything_ drew pernicious influence two. This was not means pleasant state things Jones Harpour, made hate Eden, innocent it, ever. Moreover, Harpour accustomed openly bearded, choose let reins despotism slip easily his hands, he determined avenge yet, show neither entreaties threats prevent great bully he chose. "Understand _you_, Henderson," he said, dressing; "that I shall exactly I like little muff there." Eden reddened said nothing; Henderson, looking his wash-hand basin, replied--"And understand _you_, Harpour, bully more, I will tell head school." Harpour made spring Henderson thrash words, burly Cradock interposed saying, good-humouredly, he put Harpour's way, "There, stop squabbling, goodness' sake, two, let us little peace. Flip, shut up." CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE. TO THE RESCUE. Alas! easily things go wrong! And follows mist weeping rain, And life _never_ again! George Macdonald, _Phantastes_. Eden felt immeasurable delight Walter allowed come back dormitory, he thought happy perfect security torment. But two tyrants views. Harpour, passionate dogged, likely forget he thwarted defied; he inclined, Jones would allowed so, kept egging show his contempt younger weaker boys tried check his bullying propensities. On last occasion he ordered Eden go Dan's, Eden taken Walter's advice, firmly refused go. Harpour think safe compel him, he threw significant threats, filled little boy vague alarm weighed heavily his spirits. He tell one threats, hoping would end nothing, and, case emergency, trusting implicitly Walter generous efficient protection. But threats _not_ end nothing. One night, others fallen asleep, Eden, feeling quite free anxiety, sleeping soundly sweetly he done fortnight, blaze light, flashing suddenly upon his eyes, made start his bed. Harpour Jones taking opportunity fulfil threat frightening him. At foot his bed stood figure white, hideous, deformed head, blotched scarlet; bending another white figure, enormous black face, holding head shining hand. In instant boy fell back, pale death, uttering shriek shrill terrible, full wildness horror, every boy dormitory sprang up, alarmed wide awake. Walter Henderson leaped bed immediately; Walter, unprepared, start surprise he saw sudden, moment he stood absolutely paralysed bewildered, shock nerves preceded recognition, though infinitesimally short time. But Henderson, knew Jones Harpour going on, threats been, instantly, abrupt unusual spectacle power unnerve him, saw true state case, and, springing upon figure stood end Eden's bed, tore mask away, stripped sheet, displayed Jones's face he time hide it, administering, he so, hearty blow Jones's chest, made hero stagger several paces back. Although Walter saw almost trick played masks, sheets, phosphorus, yet sudden shock upon his nerves _absolutely co-instantaneous_ discovery, produced effect utter dizziness horror. Henderson's prompt vigorous onslaught aroused sense position, fierce expression disgust anger, he bounded upon Harpour, who, thus suddenly attacked, dropped upon floor dark lantern he held, hastily retreated, flinging sheet Walter's head. Walter barely disentangled folds sheet, exclamation Henderson attracted notice boys room, brought flocking round Eden's bed. Henderson picked dark lantern, kneeling unconscious boy, whose face ashy white, who, several sharp screams, sunk deep swoon, Henderson, unused sights, naturally exclaimed-- "Good God! you have killed him." "Killed him?" repeated others, standing aghast. "Pooh! he is fainted, little fools," said Jones, hurried look Eden's face. "Here, we will soon bring too; Harpour, get us water." "You shall not touch him, shall not come near him," said Walter furiously; "stand back, hateful bullies. Henderson I attend him; and, depend upon it, shall give account soon. What! _will_ come?" he continued, shaking Jones's arm violently, flinging back easily though he child; "if either Harpour come near bed I will fetch Robertson instantly. Eden would go swoon, he saw brutes he recovered." In mood Walter resisted. The two plotters, picking masks, retired somewhat crestfallen, sat beds, rest, utmost tenderness, adopted every means knew recall Eden's fluttered agitated senses. But his swoon deeper could manage, and, growing violently alarmed trust longer, Henderson Walker proposed carry sickroom, put care Dr Keith. It vain Jones Harpour entreated, threatened, implored delay little longer, lest taking Eden sickroom, doings discovered. Wholly disregarding said, two boys uplifted still fainting friend, Harpour attempted interfere door, Cradock Franklin, _thoroughly_ sickened proceedings, pulled aside let pass. Dr Keith instantly administered Eden restorative, receiving Walter hurried explanation circumstances, gently told boys would way there, Eden evidently critical position, better return dormitories. Walter Henderson, returned, assailed others eager inquiries, could give gloomy uncertain answers. They would vouchsafe take slightest notice Jones Harpour, met remarks resolute silence. But he went sleep, Walter said, "I may well let fellows know I intend report Somers to-morrow." "Then you will damned sneak," observed Harpour. "It sneaking prevent brutal bullying like yours, giving others chance stopping it, preventing little chaps like poor Eden, you have nearly frightened death, shamefully treated. Anyhow, sneaking, not, I will it." "If tell Somers, look yourself--that is all." "I am afraid," brief retort. Harpour knew he meant he said, and, desperate, he got half hour earlier next morning try extort him, main force, promise hold his tongue affair night before. If he understood Walter's character, he might saved superfluous trouble. Walter awakened shake Harpour, who, Jones, standing his head. He saw coming, Harpour, pair braces tightly knotted his hand, briefly opened proceedings saying, "Are going sneak me, not?" "To sneak--no; tell head school--yes." "Then, Jove, shall something worth telling; I will take revenge beforehand. I shall sent away--think that." "So much better. One bully less." "Oh, that is tune? Take that." The buckle brace descended sharply Walter's back, drawing blood; next instant he wrested Harpour's hand, returned blow. The scuffle awakened rest. Walter jumped bed, hurrying his trousers slippers, Harpour knocked down. "Fair play, Harpour," said Henderson Franklin, angrily seizing Harpour's arms; "you are surely going fight him, Walter?" "Yes; see fair play, fellows; Cradock, will, will not you? Fair play I want. Flip, see Jones tries mean dodge. Now, Harpour, ready? Then take that." Walter hit steady blow face, fight unequally-matched combatants--a boy fifteen much stronger boy seventeen--began. The result could dubious. Walter fought indomitable pluck; splendid see sturdiness he bore blows Harpour's strong fist, he could return intervals. He tremendously punished, Harpour barely touched, except one well-directed blow flashed fire his eyes. At last he dealt Walter heavy blow full forehead; boy reeled, caught hold wash-hand stand stay his fall dragged floor thundering crash, dashing jug basin shivers. The smash brought Mr Robertson, whose rooms nearest Number 10. He opened his eyes amazement he came in. On one beds lay two masks dark lantern used frighten Eden; floor, supported Franklin Henderson, sat poor Walter, his nose streaming blood, his face horribly bruised disfigured; Harpour sheepishly surveyed his handiwork; Jones, first alarm, rushed back bed, covered blankets, lay appearance fast asleep. "Evson! what is this?" asked master astonishment. Walter, sick giddy, condition answer; position affairs tolerably obvious. "Is _your_ doing?" asked Mr Robertson Harpour, sternly, pointing Walter. "He hit first." "Liar," said Henderson, glaring him. "Hush, sir; language presence," said Mr Robertson. "Cradock, mean say big fellow like could stand by, see Harpour thus cruelly misuse boy nearly his size." "It fight, sir." "Fight!" said Mr Robertson; "look two boys, do not talk nonsense me." "I ought not let fight, I know," said Cradock; "and I wish, sir, you would put Harpour Jones another room, they are always bullying Eden, Evson fought." "Harpour," said Mr Robertson, "you absolutely despicable; viler figure present moment could conceived. I shall move another dormitory, monitor restrain brutality; and, meanwhile, I confine gates month, bring one hundred lines every day till notice." He leaving room, catching sight Walter, he returned, said kindly, "Evson, poor boy, I am afraid you are sadly hurt; I am truly sorry you; seem behaving noble way, I honour you. Henderson, I think you would better go Dr Keith," he continued; Walter, though he heard said, much hurt shaken speak word. "Come, Walter," said Henderson, gently helping rise; "I hope you are much hurt, old fellow. That brute Harpour will not trouble again, anyhow; his parasite Jones. Lean arm. Franklin, come give Walter arm, too." They helped sickroom, he could barely trail his legs him. Dr Keith laid quietly sofa, put arnica bruises his face, told lie still go quietly sleep. "He much hurt," he said, answer inquiries boys; "but fall he quite sufficiently serious consequences render absolute rest necessary days. You may come see sometimes." "And now, fellow, Harpour," said Henderson, re-entering dormitory; "as you have knocked Evson, half killed Eden, _I'll_ tell Somers. Do hear? I hope he will thrash till cannot stand." "He dare not; Robertson's punished already." "He dare, will; will not get lightly that." "You are set sneaks; I will even yet," growled Harpour, much cowed resent Henderson's defiance. Henderson laughed scornfully; Cradock said, "And _I'll_ tell whole school bullies you have been, Harpour Jones." "And _I_," said Franklin; "I do not envy two." "The school does not consist altogether softs lot, luckily," answered Harpour. "Softs not, we have put spoke _your_ wheel present," answered Franklin. "I congratulate rich black eye one softs, half size, given you." "They are worth snarling with, Franklin," said Henderson; "we shall rid Jones Number 10 henceforth; that is one blessing." CHAPTER TWENTY SIX. A TURBULENT SCHOOL MEETING. I hate vice bolt her arguments, And virtue tongue check her pride. Milton's Comus. Next morning, second school, Power went see Eden Walter getting on. He opened door softly, observe his entrance. Eden, pale, expression pain terror still reflected his face, lay broken restless sleep. Walter sitting still death head bed. A book lay his knees, he reading. He "brown study," dreamy far-off look his eyes fixed upon vacancy showed his thoughts wandered. It look attracted Power's attention he first saw Walter chapel, shown he common boy. It often made watch Walter, wonder _could_ occupying his thoughts. It looking poor little Eden suggested Walter's mind train thought he fallen. As he saw child tossing uneasily about, waking every half-consciousness violent start, occasionally delirious, appearances seriously ill--as he thought Dr Keith's remark, even he quite well his nervous system would probably found received shock effects would _never_ obliterated life, he could help fretting bitterly injury suffering his friend. And his spirits greatly shaken. It little matter every time he raised his hand cool his forehead, ease throbbing his head, he felt much he bruised, cut, swollen, looking-glass showed face hideously disfigured; he knew would grow right day two, he cared nothing it. But Harpour's blow knocked down, he dashed his head violence floor, hurt much made feel ill, Dr Keith without secret fears possibility concussion brain. Yet sorrow Walter felt Eden, he thinking himself. He mentally staring face face mystery human cruelty malice. The little boy, whose fine qualities besides discovered, lying pain nervous prostration, solely malignant unkindness seemed give pleasure two bad, brutal fellows. Walter rescued Eden his consistent kindness bullied, corrupted, tormented--yet apparently little purpose. That poor boy's powers would decidedly injured last prank, certain. Dr Keith dropped mysterious hints, Walter heard wild incoherent Eden's murmurs. If he become idiot? O God! men boys _such_ hearts! And Walter, yet boy, solemnly consciously recorded unspoken vow _he_ least, till death, would lay his power lighten, increase, sum human misery; he would study things kind, gentle, tender-hearted, his dealings others; he would ever watch wounding thoughts, uncharitable judgments, unkind deeds; all, he would strive his power temptation cutting sarcastic words, calumny, misrepresentation, envy, hatred, malice, uncharitableness. These noble thoughts high resolves passing boy's mind Power's quiet footstep entered room. Power stopped minute look somewhat saddening picture darkened room--Walter, still death, deep thought, his chin leaning his hand, his face presenting uncouth mixture shapes colours he sat Eden's bedside; Eden turning moaning unrefreshing sleep. Walter started his reverie smiled, Power noiselessly approached. "My poor Walter, marked are!" "Oh, never mind, it is nothing. I good because, it is done good." "Poor fellow! But how is Arty? He looks wretchedly ill." "He is sad way I am afraid, Power," said Walter, shaking his head. "I hope he will right soon." "Yes, I hope so; shall take great care him." "Poor child, poor child!" said Power, bending compassionately. "Has Flip told Somers Harpour?" asked Walter. "I do not know whether quite hearing school news yet." "O yes! tell it," said Walter eagerly. "Well, I have good news tell. It is case _ponos ponoo ponon pherei_, Percival said I told Eden. By by, he sent sorts kind messages, come see you." "Thanks; Harpour?" "Well, Flip meant tell Somers, whole thing spread school once, morning chapel well over; so, Dimock head Robertson's house, thought _his_ place take up. He sent Harpour classroom, told he meant cane his abominable, ruffianly conduct; he would begun, Harpour seized hold cane, would not let go. Luckily Dimock did not fly rage, he let fight, Harpour wanted bring on. He simply let go cane quite coolly, said, `Very well, Harpour, would good deal best taken quietly caning thoroughly deserve; do not choose that, I shall put matter Somers' hands. I am glad rid responsibility.'" "Did end there?" "Not bit it; school ferment. You know present monitors, particularly Somers, are not popular; Harpour _is_ popular, although he is brute, he is great swell cricket games. I am afraid shall regular monitorial row. The monitors convened meeting morning decide Harpour; and, tell truth, I should not wonder school got counter-meeting." "Do not masters know Eden?" "Not officially, though I think rumours must got them." "But surely it is odd school side Jones Harpour, shameful mischief they have done?" "Odd, _a priori_; lots things always combine make school opinion, know fellows catch hear first. But think foremost champion school side--stirring resist, abusing you, abusing Flip, abusing monitors, making light Harpour's doings?" Walter asked "Who?" he knew beforehand Power's answer would be-- "Kenrick!" After he said nothing, put his hand wearily his head, his weak state, aching violently excitement news Power told him. "Ah, I see, Walter, you are quite well enough yet bothered. I will leave quiet. Good-bye." "Good-bye. Do come soon, tell things go on." Strolling sad sickroom court, Power attracted great schoolroom sound angry voices. Entering, he found half school, lower forms, collected round large desk headmaster usually sat. A great many talking once, every tongue engaged discussing propriety, instance, monitorial interference. "Order, order," shouted one two fifth-form fellows present; "let us thing managed properly. Who will take chair?" There general call Kenrick, he one highest fellows room, he got chair, amid general silence delivered his views present affair. "You know," he said, "that Dimock meant cane Harpour he played joke one fellows last night. Harpour refused take caning, monitors holding meeting morning decide Harpour. Now _I_ maintain they have right anything; it is important should not let way. The thing merely joke. Who thinks anything putting mask fun, startle another fellow? One constantly hears done merely raise laugh, must often seen pictures it. Of course, case, every one extremely sorry consequences, impossible foresee _them_, nobody right judge act turned unluckily. I vote put question--`Have monitors right interfere?'" Loud applause greeted end Kenrick's speech, little bit end separating act consequences told wonderfully among boys. They raised almost unanimous cry "Well done, Ken", "Quite right", "Harpour shall not caned." Henderson watching Kenrick expression intense anger disdain. At end his remarks, he sprang, rather rose, immediately began pour impetuous answer. His first words, fellows observed he meant speak, drowned general uproar; caught sight him, expression decided disapprobation ran round throng listeners. It make swerve slightest degree. Looking round scornfully steadily, he said-- "I know hiss. You think I told Dimock Harpour. As happens I _didn't_; I am neither afraid ashamed tell all, I told Harpour his face, I fully intended it-- rather I meant tell, Dimock, Somers. _Will_ let speak?" he asked, angrily, his last sentence interrupted burst groans, commenced whose interests stake, taken mass ignorant boys. Power plucked Henderson sleeve, whispered, "Hush, Flip; go on, keep temper." "I have much right speak--if meant school meeting--as Kenrick one else; I say this: Kenrick merely throwing dust eyes, misleading altogether true state case. It is fine, easy talk lightly `a joke,' `a bit fun,' on; I like ask whether he believes that? whether he is hunting popularity, mixing private spites? whether he is thoroughly ashamed moment? There! may see he is," continued Henderson, pointing him; "see he blushing scarlet, looking picture degradation." Here Kenrick started irascibly informed Henderson he was not going sit slanged him, he chair, he would let Henderson go unless he cut short his abuse; Kenrick saying this, he entirely carried meeting him, Power whispered, "You are getting personal, Flip; go on, say Kenrick--though I am afraid it is true." "Well, rate, I say this," continued Henderson, whose flow words rather stopped his pulled often--"and I ought know, I room time, I appeal Anthony Franklin, rest dormitory, say is not true. It _wasn't_ joke. It was not _meant_ joke. It piece deliberate, diabolical--" "Oh! oh! oh!" began Harpour's claqueurs, chorus swelled score others. "I repeat it--of deliberate, diabolical cruelty, chosen nothing cruel dared do. And," he said, speaking top his voice, make heard clamour, "the fellows disgrace Saint Winifred's, deserve caned monitors, fellows ever did." He sat amid storm disapprobation, his look never quailed instant, he glanced steadily round, noticed Kenrick, though favour multitude, much higher school, venture meet his eye. And he compensated general disfavour, feeling Power's hand rest his shoulder, hearing whisper, "That is _famous_, Flip; you are dear plucky fellow. Walter could not done firmly." Then Belial-like, rose Mackworth, perfectly his ease, intending much general mischief lay his power, bent saying many unpleasant things he could. In this, however, his benevolent views materially frustrated Henderson, made his contemptuous comments tone sufficiently loud heard many, quite distinctly enough disconcert Mackworth's oratory. "As gentleman sat poured many bottles wrath--" "Bottles French varnish," suggested Henderson--"on heads generally, I must allowed make remarks reply. His speech consisted nothing rabid abuse; without shred argument."--"Rabid fact without shred fudge," interpolated Henderson. "If every trifling freak fellows telling monitors, better inaugurate era sneaks cowards." "Era sham polish fiddlestick ends," echoed Henderson; Mackworth, every intention making flourishing speech, disconcerted unwonted pruning his periods, he somewhat abruptly sat down, muttering anathemas Henderson, flustered quite his usual bland manner. "Something said cowardice sneaking," said Whalley, getting up. "I like know whether think cowardly fight fellow twice one's size, mark pretty considerably too" (a remark Whalley unceremoniously emphasised pointing Harpour's black eye), "or lay plot frighten dark mere child, nervous timid, never harmed one his life." Next, Howard Tracy, addressing meeting, running his hand occasionally his hair, "would put question different footing altogether. As done Eden, he stood neutral ground, gave opinion. But who, he asked, monitors thrash _any one all_? He never heard particularly good families, anything whatever gave claim interfere fellows. The question was, whether parcel monitors domineer school?" "The question nothing kind!" said Franklin bluntly; "it was, whether big bullies, like Harpour, perfect liberty frighten fellows idiots beat mummies, pleasure? That question. Harpour Somers-- bullies monitors--which have, boys?" And arose perfect hubbub voices. Some got ridiculed monitors; others extolled Harpour, tried make he misused called account mere frolic; others taunted Evson Henderson conspiracy private enemies. On whole, nearly unanimous agreeing school prevent monitors exercise authority. And then, midst hubbub, Power rose, "in act graceful," immediate general call silence. To great majority boys, Power hardly known except name sight; his school successes, his rare ability, his stainless character, many personal advantages, commanded highest admiration. His numerous slight acquaintances school liked his pleasant playful courtesy, proud know him; his friends entertained almost extravagant affection. His ancient name, his good family, respect due his high position school, would alone sufficient gain favourable hearing; but, besides this, he hitherto come forward little, strong curiosity see line he would take, he would able speak. There indeed anxious silence quickly possible, knowing effect his words would likely produce; he began, raised several noisy interruptions; Kenrick, shame, obliged first demand attention which, first sentence two, his quiet, conciliatory, persuasive manner effectually secured. Reviewing whole tumultuary discussion, he began answering Kenrick. After alluding long course bullying ended manner, he appealed common sense meeting whether thing could regarded mere joke, remembered Eden's tender age highly susceptible nature? Was certain, must obvious bullies, serious, desperately dangerous results _must_ follow? What results well-known, describing he seen sickroom half hour before, Power made warm appeal feelings pity indignation--an appeal every one felt manly, could fail deeply touching, simple natural. "Then," said Power, "the next speaker talked sneaking cowardice. Well, charges sufficiently answered Whalley, and, indeed, behalf his friends Evson Henderson, he perhaps need hardly condescend answer all. His friend Henderson long enough among need defence, he _did_, would sufficiently supplied high courage, seen specimen. As Evson, boy given many proofs honour manliness _he_ done his two terms Saint Winifred's, certainly required one's shield thrown _him_. Would show courage walking across Razor dark foggy winter's night? would find school fellow Evson's age would shrink standing regular fair fight another twice his strength size? Those charges he thought he might throw winds; he sure one believed them; was, he admitted, one cowardice his two friends often guilty, cowardice need blush; he meant cowardice, arrant, noble cowardice afraid _not_ thought right, afraid _knew_ base wrong." In remarks Power quite carried his audience away him; strain higher mood boys often heard boys, delivered eloquence earnestness raised continuous applause. This, however, Power checked going speaking he obliged stop take breath; _then_ burst unmistakable enthusiastic manner, entirely drowned timid counter-demonstrations Jones Mackworth school. "Now I detained long," said Power, "and I apologise (Go on! go on! shouted boys); _many_ spoken side, this, perhaps excuse (Yes, yes!) Well, then, Tracy asked, `Who monitors? right interfere?' I answer, monitors schoolfellows, simply representatives mature form public school opinion. They lower boys; worked way foremost place; are, short, oldest, cleverest, strongest, wisest among us; And right depends authority voluntarily delegated masters, parents, ourselves--a right originally founded justice common sense, venerable many years prestige success. At rate, fellow behaves Harpour done, _least_ right complain exercise higher authority. If he right--and he right except brute strength, right--to bully, beat, torment, perhaps injure life poor little inoffensive child, render name school infamous, I maintain monitors, interest school heart, ranged _ex officio_ side truth, justice, honour, infinitely right thrash it. Supposing monitors, would state school be? all, would condition younger weaker boys? would absolutely defenceless prey odious tyranny. Let say then, I distinctly emphatically approve manner friends acted; I envy admire moral courage helped behave did; school attempts occasion resist legitimate wholesome exercise monitors' power, suffer deep disgrace serious loss. I oppose Kenrick's motion every feeling heart, every sentiment mind. I think dangerous, I think useless, I think _most unjust_." A second burst applause followed Power's energetic words, continued several minutes. He utterly changed opinions many present, Kenrick felt his entire sympathy admiration enlisted behalf his former friend. He would moment given anything get retract his previous remarks beg pardon them. But his pride passion strong him, coldly rising, he put meeting, "whether decided monitors right interfere not." Jones, Mackworth, Harpour, others, eagerly canvassing votes, Kenrick demanded show hands, good many raised side. When opposite question put, first Power, Henderson, Whalley, Franklin held hands; soon followed Bliss, Anthony Cradock, great many took courage saw champions side. The hands counted, found equal number sides. The announcement received dead silence. "The chairman course casting vote," said Mackworth. Kenrick sat still moment, without inward conflict; then, afraid risk his popularity he adopted his set, he said, rising-- "And I give _against_ right monitors." A scene eager partisanship loud triumph ensued, Power stood forward, observed-- "You must allow remind present meeting way represents sense school. I see dozen boys present lowest fifth-form; I earnestly entreat gained vote disturb peace comfort school attempting collision monitors, certainly supported nearly unanimous opinion upper fifth forms." "We shall see that," answered Kenrick confident tone. "At rate, vote carried." He left chair, boys broke various groups, still eagerly discussing rights wrongs question stirred. "_So_, Power," said Kenrick, sneer, he assumed hide his real feelings, "all fine eloquence thrown away, see. We have carried day all, spite you." "Yes, Ken," said Power, gently; "you have carried _quocunque modo_. How comes Kenrick side Jones, Mackworth, Harpour?" CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN. THE MONITORS. In teeth clenched antagonisms. Tennyson. The meeting over, Henderson, seen Walter since morning, flew sickroom tell news, he sure would specially interest him. As he entered, spectacle Power already seen--little Eden restless, sometimes wandering--Walter seated silently bed watching him, his legs crossed, his hands clasped one knee. The curtains drawn exclude glare. Walter could read little, his eyes weak fight; his thoughts his nursing his little friend kept occupied. Henderson, fresh excitement meeting, struck deep contrast presented painfully quiet scene. He advancing eagerly, Walter rose his finger his lip, spoke whisper, Eden dropped sleep. Henderson shook warmly hand, whispered--"I have lots tell you;" and, sitting Walter, he gave account taken place. "You heard Power, Walter; upon word he spoke like orator, regularly bowled Harpour lot legs. It is splendid see coming school-- is not it?" "It indeed; thanks you, too, Flip, sticking me." "Oh, I nothing. But fancy fellow Kenrick fighting us like this, giving his casting vote Harpour's thrashed! You have idea, Walter, fellow's changed." He interrupted, Eden woke short scream, and, starting bed, looked round scared expression, shuddering moaning he fell back his pillow. "Oh, do not, do not, do not frighten me," he said appealingly, perspiration burst his pale face; "please, Harpour, _please_ do not. Oh, Walter, Walter, _do_ help me." "Hush, poor, little fellow, I am here," said Walter tenderly, he smoothed his pillow; "do not afraid, Arty, you are quite safe, I am staying you. They put masks frighten you; nothing that." Bending bed, he talked gentle, soothing voice, tried make feel ease, child flung his arms round his neck, sobbing, still clung tight his hand Walter succeeded allaying sudden paroxysm terror. Henderson, deeply touched, looked glistening eyes. "How kind are, Walter," he said, taking his hand, affectionately pressing it. "I like Kenrick here, show his new friends done." "Do not indignant him, Flip. I wish, indeed, he would come room, make us, he was. But he even take slightest notice letter I wrote him, entreating overlook fault I guilty of, however unconsciously. I never meant wrong him, I love much ever." "Love him!" said Henderson, "_I_ do not; his new line is not half fancy. He must jolly miserable, that is one comfort." "Hush! he _was_ friend, Flip, remember; indeed, _I_ feel friend still, whatever his feelings _me_. But think he must miserable?" "Because see his face manner, he knows he is wrong, thoroughly ashamed bottom." "Well, let us hope he will come round sooner. Have broken him, then?" "Well, nearly. We barely civil other, that is all, I do not suppose shall even now: I pitched to-day meeting." Walter sighed, Power stole room. "Hallo!" he said, "Flip, I believe I shall kill invalids us. I met Dr Keith stairs, he gave leave come five minutes, he says need quiet. You, I suspect, Master Flip, took French leave." "I like that," said Henderson, laughing, "considering _second_ visit, first. I have telling Walter meeting." "The credit--if any--is yours, Flip; broke ice, showed Harpourites were not going carry way, fancied." "I am glad came strong, Power," said Walter; "Flip says took storm." "That is Flip's humbug," said Power; "but," he whispered, "if I good, it is you, Walter." "How mean?" "Why, first all, I was not going hear animals like Mackworth abuse you; next, I continued old selfish way keeping aloof school concerns. It cost effort conquer shyness, I remembered old talk Appenfell, Walter." Walter smiled gratefully, Power continued, "But I have come tell bit news." "What is that?" asked eagerly. "Why, there is notice board, signed Somers, say `All school requested stay places master left room two of the clock calling-over.'" "Whew! row shall have!" said Henderson. "How I wish I well enough now," said Walter. "I hate shut going on." "Poor fellow, _that_ face?" said Power. "No; must content wait get well." "It is not face keeps in, Power; it is bang head, Keith says." "Yes, Keith says he does not know _will_ well young chatterboxes stay you," said good-humoured doctor, entering moment. "Vanish you!" The boys smiled bade Walter good-bye, wished speedy relief Dr Keith's prison. "And think poor little Eden may come sit study again?" asked Power. "I miss much." "You must not think long time," answered doctor. "How two of the clock affair?" said Henderson, left room. "Upon word I do not know. Sit next me, Flip, case row." "Are monitors strong enough, think?" "We shall see." The school fever excitement curiosity. At dinner-time nothing else talked lower boys, upper forms kept dignified silence. Two of the clock came. The names school called over, amid perfect silence master week left hall. Then Somers stood dais said-- "Is Harpour here?--the rest please keep places." "I am here--what want _me_?" said Harpour sulkily, he stood his place. "First all, I want tell whole school behaving shamefully cruel blackguard way, way produced disastrous consequences one little fellows. A big fellow like ought _thoroughly_ ashamed conduct. If capable blush ought blush it. It duty monitors, duty Head school, punish conduct, Dr Lane left hands; I going cane it. Stand out." "I will not. I will see damned first." A sensation ran school open defiance; Somers, quite unmoved, repeated-- "I take notice words tell swear additional punishment; I tell stand out." Harpour quailed little his firm tone, total absence support his followers; he flatly refused stand out. "Very well," said Somers; "you already defied authority one monitor, aggravation original offence. I glad avoided scene, common sense does not make bear punishment coolly, shall bear force. Will stand out?--no?--then shall made. Fetch here, one," he said, turning sixth-form. The second monitor, Danvers, quietly seized Harpour's right arm, Macon, one biggest fellows fifth-form, his accord got seized other, Harpour's heart sank this, Danvers cricket eleven, he strong either singly. "Now mark," said Somers; "caned _shall_ be, redeem character school; unless take without _made_ take it, name shall also immediately struck school list, shall leave Saint Winifred's evening. You will great loss, I take it. So much I may tell proof Headmaster left _us_ vindicate name Saint Winifred's." Seeing resistance useless, Harpour accordingly stood centre room, he cast inquiring look among embraced his side; these, who, seen, tolerably numerous, looked Kenrick he might give hint do. Thus appealed to, Kenrick rose said-- "I protest caning." "You!" said Somers, turning contemptuously direction; "who you?" The general titter words caused made Kenrick furious, he cried angrily-- "It opinion majority school." "We shall see," said Somers, stinging _sang froid_; "meanwhile, may sit down, let majority school speak themselves, otherwise may requested occupy still prominent position. I shall something say _you_ presently." "Let us rescue him," said Kenrick, springing forward, several fellows stirred answer appeal; Macon, seizing hold Tracy one arm, Mackworth other, thrust floor, Danvers, catching hold Kenrick, swung form, pinned there. The general laugh proceeding received showed small handful school really opposed monitors, boys thoroughly concurred them, held right. So Macon quietly boxed Jones's ears, since Jones making noise, told others might return places. Crimsoned shame anger, Kenrick sat down, Somers proceeded administer Harpour severe caning. That worthy quite meant stretch utmost his powers endurance, made several scornful remarks first blows. But Somers intention let easily; sneer followed harder cut, remarks soon followed silent significant wince. It writhe succeeded sob, sob howl, Somers said him-- "Now may go." And Harpour go his seat, agony mingled pain shame. He boasted repeatedly he would never take thrashing anyone; he _had_ taken it, succumbed it, presence whole school. He tremendously ashamed; he never forgot scene, determined never lose opportunity revenging it. The school felt act simple justice, punishment richly deserved. They looked stern silence, lower boys morning determined interfere, gazed discomfiture upon champion's fall. "And now, Master Kenrick, _you_ stand here--what, no!--Stand here, sir." Kenrick glared defiance. "Danvers, hand here;" Danvers stepped Somers whispered, "Do not sharp him, Somers, you will drive despair. Remember he is high fifth, distinguished fellow. Do not make much one escapade." "All right. Thanks, Danvers," said Somers; added aloud, less sarcastic tone--"Come here, Kenrick; I merely wish speak word you;" Danvers kindly firmly took boy's hand, led forward. "You said majority school denied right interfere." No answer. "Do consider person majority school, pray?" No answer. "We perfectly aware, sir, meeting, precious casting vote. But must informed rabble she will fourth-form boys constitute school sense word. And understand too, even majority school _had_ us, monitors quite ignorant solemn duty make reason letting brutal cowardly act bullying go unpunished. You silly, Kenrick, misled conceit. Yes, may look angry; know old; you have never received anything kindness hands since day fag, I tell you have misled conceit. Think rather less yourself, good fellow. You ought known better. Your friend Power shown infinitely sensible example. _You_ may sit down, sir, warning; and, name monitors, I beg thank fellows, especially Evson Henderson, best protect little Eden. They behaved like thorough gentlemen, would well younger boys equally alive true honour school." "I wish he would conciliatory," whispered Dimock Danvers; "he is plucky firm, dictatorial unpersuasive. Besides, he is forgotten thank Power." "Yes," said Danvers, "his tone spoils all. Somers," he said, "you have omitted mention Power, fellows gone minute." "I have talking much, say it." "Not I; I am speaker. Here, Dimock will." "Ay, that will do. One minute more, please," called Somers, raising his hand boys, who, rapidly whispered conversation, beginning leave places. "Somers wishes add," said Dimock, "that monitors many sixth fifth forms wish express best thanks Power exceedingly honourable fearless way he morning maintained rights duties belong us. You younger fellows know well monitors extremely dislike interfere, rarest occasions, always anxious avoid caning. You know never resort unless obliged flagrant offences, would otherwise sap honour character school. Let us united work together good Saint Winifred's. Do not let interested parties lead believe either wish tyrannise. Our authority high direct advantage; I appeal whether know it?" "Yes, yes, Dimock," answered many voices; streamed ball, gave "three cheers monitors," heartily responded to, hissing Harpour, Kenrick, others, raised laugh, filled brim bitter cup hate indignation Kenrick forced day drink. To addressed like whole school--snubbed, reproved, threatened--it intolerable; he, Kenrick, high school, brilliant, promising, successful, accustomed flattery praise, publicly set among rabble lower boys--it made mad think it. "A nice tell-tale mess you have made business, Power," he said savagely, red spot still lingering his cheek, he confronted his former friend; "I hope you are ashamed yourself." "I, Ken? no." "Then ought be." "Honestly, Ken, ought ashamed--you, advocate Harpour his set, I, merely defended best friend behaving honourably--as he always does?" "_Always_?" sneered Kenrick. Power turned his clear bright eye, said nothing moment; he laid his arm across his shoulder old familiar manner, said, "You happy now, Ken, used be." "Why devil not?" Power shook his head. "Because heart nobler acts; nature truer conduct; _that_ punishment. Why nurse bad feeling till mastered you?" Kenrick stood still, his cheeks flushed, his eyes downcast; Power, he turned away, sadly repeated, half wonderful verse-- "Virtutem _videant, intabescantque relicta_." Kenrick understood it; came his heart like arrow, rankled there; made wound, faithful wound friend, better kisses enemy--but time healing far-off yet. CHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT. FALLING AWAY. Oh deeper dole! That august spirit, sphered fair, Should starry sessions his peers, Decline quench bright brilliancy In hell's sick spume. Ay me, deeper dole! Tannhauser. It generally Sundays boys walked croft were, wished considered as, intimate confidential friends. To one knew anything boys' characters, curious suggestive observe groups spontaneously formed themselves. The sets Saint Winifred's exclusive accurately defined; one boy might, virtue different sympathies accomplishments, belong two three sets once. Still sets whose outermost circles barely touched other; hitherto friends among Kenrick chiefly moved would never associated intimately fellows among Harpour considered leading spirit. It therefore little surprise Mr Percival, Mr Paton passed croft his Sunday stroll, observed Kenrick-- his usual companions, Power Walter Whalley--but arm arm Harpour Tracy, accompanied one two boys similar character. It immediately explained much taken place. He heard vague rumours part Kenrick taken meeting; he heard Walter longer good terms other; plain Kenrick breaking loose his old moorings, sailing open sea wilfulness pride. "What much interested about?" asked Mr Paton, his colleague followed boys his glance. "I wondering change come Kenrick." "What change?" "Do not see he walking? Oh, I forgot never notice kind outer life among boys; hand, I always do; helps understand fellows, I otherwise could." "You observe purpose, Percival, rate, influence among wonderful--as I occasion discover every then." "But Kenrick puzzles me. `_Nemo repente fuit turpissimus_' one used think; yet boy dropped society noble fellow Power, his exquisite mind manners, plumb abyss intimacy Harpour. There must something wrong." A little observation showed Mr Percival his conjectures Kenrick correct. Clever he was, his work deteriorated rapidly; whole expression his countenance changed worse; he implicated questionable transactions; he lost caste among best honourable fellows, proportionately gained influence among worst lowest lot school, whose idol hero he gradually became. His descent sudden, his character always unstable. The pride passion mollified restrained long he moved wise upright companions, broke forth violence he fancied slighted, committed course he well knew wrong. There one conjectured much early period. It Kenrick's mother; his letters always indicated exact state his thoughts feelings; Mrs Kenrick knew coldness recklessness lately marked proofs her boy going wrong. The violence, too, he spoke Evson, indications he dropped his old friends taken new worse companions, filled her mind anxiety distress; yet could she do, poor lady, her lonely home? There one thing she could her weakness; outpourings sorrowful earnest prayer vain. Mr Percival tried make effort save Kenrick wrong courses he adopted; he asked quietly come take glass wine dinner; interview made matters worse. Kenrick, undated his popularity among lower forms champion supposed "rights" school, chose adopt independent almost patronising tone towards his tutor; he entered jaunty manner, glancing carelessly table, declined take fruit master invited help himself. He determined uncommunicative possible; avoided conversation, answered Mr Percival's questions subjects monosyllables, uttered disrespectful nonchalant tone. Yet he despised ill ease. He knew deep kindness master's intentions, felt he ought grateful interest shown towards him; required stronger power different method his own, exorcise his heart devil self-will; besides this, cannot denied first bloom novelty sin, free exercise insolent liberty, sense pleasure many hearts; honey rim poison-cup, bloom Dead Sea apple, mirage scorching waste. Mr Percival understood thoroughly, saw he must left bitter teachings experience. Always fond Kenrick, he never blind his many faults character, particularly displeased his present manner, he knew adopted purpose baffle approach advice warning. "Good morning, Kenrick," he said, rising rather abruptly, slight smile pity rested his lips. "Good morning, sir," said Kenrick; he rose airy manner leave room, Mr Percival put hand boy's shoulders, looked steadily face. Kenrick tried meet look, old open gaze frank innocent confidence, expression half shrinking, half defiant. His eyes fell immediately, satisfied perusal his features Kenrick going wrong, Mr Percival said this-- "Your face, boy, book men May read strange matters." Kenrick tried off-hand patronising manner, attempt failed egregiously, he felt uncomfortable he left room he often met kindness, he _never_ entered terms again. Meanwhile two invalids, Walter Eden, recovered slowly. But kindness every one hours would passed wearily sickroom. Their tedium enlivened constant visits Henderson Power, never failed interest Walter school news, especially telling numerous little incidents tended show although late excitements certain detumescence, still general effect arouse spirit opposition constituted authority. Kenrick's name sometimes lips, could speak favourably, subject painful one, rarely talked much him. Among visitors Dr Lane, who, well Mrs Lane, showed great solicitude them. The Doctor, told Dr Keith that, Walter's tender nursing, Eden's case might assumed far dangerous complexion, lent interesting books pictures, often came minutes exchange kind words them. Mrs Lane asked Lodge, read them, sang them, played chess draughts them, often gave drives her carriage. These little gracious acts simple kindness hearts boys, hastened convalescence. Sometimes Walter allowed take Eden stroll shore school hours, danger excited interrupted boisterous society boys. There one favourite spot two often sat reading talking. It mouth little river--a green knoll sheltered rising hills, feet little waves came rippling musically summer tide flowed in. And Eden would lie full length soft grass, doze quietly, gentle breeze lifted his fair hair his forehead refreshful coolness; he would listen Walter read stirring ballad pleasant tale. And thus course fortnight Walter again, Eden, long after, far recovered allowed join his schoolfellows usual routine. He was, however, removed Walter, Henderson, Power, another dormitory, themselves; promise this, relieving his mind constant source dread, helped recover. The boys, too, conscious great wrong done him, received back among unusual consideration delicate kindness. They pitied heartily. It impossible looked his wan, sad face, changed expression; observed his timid, shrinking manner, tremor came sudden sight sound. So every voice softened spoke him, manner even roughest boys became affectionate even caressing. If felt inclined side Harpour monitors before, sight Eden went far alter convictions. Yet poor child never happy except he Walter's society, Power's study. Even he changed. The bright merry laugh rang incessantly rarely never heard now; somewhat sad smile could elicited him. He seemed, too, lost time his old interest work. The form competition attraction him; work seemed irksome, he spirits join game. Once Power kindly rallied his general listlessness, Eden looked appealingly, said, weak tears overflowed his eyes, "Do not angry me, Power, I cannot help it; I do not feel quite, right yet. O, Power, I am afraid you will never like did." "Why, Arty, illness reason I should." "But, Power, I shall never I was. It seems light gone left dark." "Nonsense, Arty; summer holidays bring round again." But Eden shook his head, muttered something Colonel Braemar kind his little sister. "Do think would let come stay part holidays us?" Eden brightened moment, promised write ask. CHAPTER TWENTY NINE. WALTER'S HOLIDAYS. Such delights As float earth, permitted visitants, When hour solemn jubilee The massy gates Paradise thrown Wide open. Coleridge _Religious Musings_. In scenes like these, part sunshine part storm, half-year rolled round, brought long-desired summer holidays. Once end half-year saw Power usual brilliantly successful, Walter head his form. Henderson, too, although he could proceed Walter _pari passu_, among first six, gained one school distinction. But Kenrick time failed he never done before; he fourth his form, although natural fruit his recent idleness, caused cruel mortification. The end term pass quite smoothly pleasantly generally did. The opposition monitorial authority Harpour commenced, Kenrick abetted, pass away once; left large amount angry feeling minds numerous boys had, them, influence several ways. Kenrick always went verge impertinence whenever he could possibly dealing sixth, Somers his manner always intentionally rude, although he managed steer clear overt insubordination. He could, course, act thus without risk incurring punishment, without coming positive collision. Many boys unfortunately ready imitate his example. These dissensions positively break prize day, made proceedings far less pleasant unanimous would been. The cheers usually given head school purposely omitted, fear provoking counter-demonstration, remained uneasy feeling many minds. The success concert yearly given school choir distribution prizes also marred traces dissension. In concert Walter solo sing, although he sang remarkably well his sweet ringing voice, he vexed hear decided hisses among plaudits greeted him. Altogether prize day--a great day Saint Winifred's--was less successful ever known be. It brought, however, one pleasure Walter, acquaintance Sir Lawrence Lady Power, heard often son's letters, begged introduced soon arrived. He great deal day, he helped Power show interesting school environs. They saw Eden too, Lady Power kindly pressed her invitation Mrs Braemar, also present, sorry Arty could stay family well connected, high position. When Walter left them, Power earnestly asked his mother she thought his friend. "He charming boy I ever saw," said Lady Power, "and I rejoice chosen friend. But do not tell anything Kenrick, fond; that?" "I still fond him, mother, he changed good deal lately." At moment Kenrick passed arm arm Harpour, though confirm Power's words, recognised ostentatiously careless nod. It thus Walter's first year Saint Winifred's ended; spite drawbacks he felt distinguished happy year. He yearning home, he felt he could meet his dear ones honest pride. He made arrangements correspond Henderson Eden holidays, Power promised visit Semlyn, condition he would come back spend week Severn Park, might double bond union them. Very early next morning boys swarming coaches, carriages, brakes, every conceivable vehicle could possibility convey nearest station. A hearty cheer accompanied coach rolled heavy excited freight; nine of the clock boy left behind. The great buildings Saint Winifred's still death; footfall chance passer-by echoed desolately among them. A strange, mournful, conscious silence hung old monastic pile. The young life usually played like sunshine it, pouring unwonted brightness many happy English homes. It late afternoon Walter found top hill looks Semlyn Lake. The water lay beneath sheet placid silver; flowers scattered every side beds emerald sunlit moss; air, stirred light breeze, rich balmy ambrosial scent summer groves; high overhead old familiar hills reared magnificent summits deep unclouded blue. But Walter's bright eye fixed one spot enchanting scene--the spot gables his father's house rose picturesquely slope lake, little bay sea dark green firs gave glimpse garden, he could discover figures his brothers sisters play. A sense unspoken, unspeakable happiness flowed boy's warm heart, moment his eyes suffused tears, tears always spring fountain heart stirred strong emotion inmost depths--the tears come even laughter show pleasures alloy. The coach still behind toiling slowly ascent. Leaving convey his luggage house, he plunged green winding path, ankle-deep soft grasses innumerable flowers, led his home short cut down, valley, along burnside, waving woods. That sweet woodland path, cool fragrant burning summer-day, he often gathered little red ripe wild strawberries peeped scented spikes golden agrimony, white graceful flowers circoea, familiar dear earliest childhood. He plunged delight, springing along joyous steps, reached ten minutes wicket-gate led his father's grounds. The first thing see recognise graceful pet fawn his sister's, his whistle came trotting delight, jingling little silver bell tied blue riband round neck. Barely stopping caress beautiful little creature's head, he bounded orchard garden, next instant delighted shout his brothers sisters welcomed back, ran up, glee innocent happy childhood, greet repeated kisses. "Ah, papa mamma," he cried, breaking away laughing group, his mother advanced open arms meet him, pressed her heart long embrace. "I am first form, papa," he said, looking joyously his father's face. "Head remove again." "Are you, Walter? I happy hear it. Few things could give pleasure." "But that is nothing _home_," he said, shouting aloud uncontrolled exuberance his spirits, hardly knowing way turn multiplicity objects seemed claim his instant attention. "Do come rounds me, Charlie," he said his favourite brother, "and let see dear old places again. We shall back minutes." "And then, I dare say, you will glad tea," said his mother. "_Rather_!" said Walter; "let us lawn, mother." The proposal carried acclamation, soon table laid witch elm house, Walter's little sisters heaped several dishes freshly plucked fruit, laid midst flowers vine leaves, Walter, his face beaming his eyes dancing happiness, asking answering thousand incessant questions, yet he managed enjoy thoroughly large bunch grapes, immense plate strawberries cream. And tea still sat lovely garden witch elm ceased chequer faces rain flickering light; lake paled pure gold rose-colour, rose-colour dull crimson, dull crimson silver grey, rippled silver grey deep black blue, relieved thousand flashing edges molten silver quivering gold, crescent moon innumerable stars. And bats almost ceased wheel, moist air early night flowers diffusing luscious sweetness, nightingale flooding grove her unimaginable rapture, eager talk hushed delicious calm happy silence, moved. It beautiful picture--the father mother still youthful enough enjoy life full, happy heart, proud eldest boy; his two young brothers looking eager hope love; little sisters arms twined round his neck, fair hair falling his shoulders; noble, mirthful, fearless, thrice happy boy himself--a family circle unseparated distance, unshadowed sorrow, unbroken death, seated exquisite scene lawn happy English home. Thrice happy! yes, spite sin sorrow, retribution remorse, _are_ hours cup sparkles hands, filled brim; (as often) earthly waters; intoxicating wine flames magic bowl pleasure; red ragged lees wrath satiety; crystal rivers water life itself. There _are_ hours rate some. Whether come mankind I know not; whether squalid Andaman hideous Fuegian ever feel I know not; nay, I know whether ever come, whether ever come, wretched outcasts earth's abject poverty fathomless degradation; whether ever come, whether ever come, cruel proud, malicious mean, cynical discontented; yet, come these, God help them! surest pledges immortality; young innocent--ay, even young guilty--they sometimes come--these hours absorbing limitless enjoyment; glimpses dimly remembered paradise; odours snatched primal Eden, golden age justice still lived upon earth, crime yet unknown. There hours, English family hour one them. Thrice happy Walter! almost like dream happiness holidays home--and _such_ home--flew by. Every day hour change pleasure pleasure; among hills, boat sunlit lake, plunging his cool morning swim fresh waters, cricketing, riding, fishing, walking his father mother brothers, sitting talking cool nightfall moonlit garden, Walter happy day long. And Power came spend week them, charming every one he saw his cheerful unselfishness engaging manners, charmed beyond expression he saw Walter's home, agreed nothing wanting make happiness "an entire perfect chrysolite." Power, seen, something young poet, day he left Semlyn Walter, accompany home, he sat long time silent train, tore leaf his pocket-book, he scribbled following lines Semlyn Lake. If earthly homes shine fair With sky wave purely blue, Beneath balmy purple air, If hills rich hue; If fancy fails paint scene In Eden's soft floral glades, Where azure clear golden green More sweetly blend silver shades; If marked flecked sinful stains, Earth hath lost her power bless, But still, beneath cloud, remains So steeped perfect loveliness; Merged, are, doubt fear, Yet, yearn realms bliss, We scarce dream, lingering here, Of fairer heaven this. Poor verses, showing delicate sensibility healthy boy; yet dear dear Walter Power's sake, show strange charm Semlyn gift appreciating natural treasures earth plentifully fills her lap. CHAPTER THIRTY. PART II. OLD AND NEW FACES. Pudorem, amicitiam, pudicitiam, divina atque humana promiscum, nihil pensi neque moderati habere. Sallust. And now, gentle ungentle reader, must imagine two whole years passed since conclusion summer holidays, meet young friends Saint Winifred's. The two years--as years not?--have full change. Walk across court me, let us discover present state things. The first meet Walter Power--taller manlier looking were, otherwise little changed appearance. Walter, his dark hair blue eyes, his graceful figure open face, still handsome, attractive-looking boy used see. Power, too, refined, thoughtful look, delicate yet noble features, eyes, recognise clear bright index beautiful unstained soul. And neither boys failed promise earlier days, warm friendship regarded done much bring result. Each his way rejoiced his youth, passed innocent happy boyhood, stored pleasant reminiscences days, filled high hopes manly principles, habits well-regulated, fine self-control taught them-- "Rapt reverential awe, To sit, self-governed fiery prime Of youth, obedient feet law." They enjoyed gifts early years without squandering wasteful profusion; felt known purest pleasures also sweetest permanent. Their minds well cultivated, bodies vigorous health, hearts glowing generous impulse warm enthusiasm; sorrow ever darken years, never drive despair, wandered pleasant paths wisdom, drunk pure cup innocence, carry torrid zone youth clear consciences, unremorseful memories, unpolluted minds. Who saunters across playground, talking loud, self-confident tones two three fellows round him, his hands his pockets, his air haughty nonchalant, his cap little one side? He still pleasant looking, his face still shows capabilities good great things, obliged say him: "Quantum mutatus ab illo Hectore!" Yes, Kenrick--for he--is altered worse. Something left, traces upon his face, history two degenerate years. His cheek look capable longer ingenuous blush, curl his lip nostril speaks perpetual unhealthy scorn, child mortified vanity conceit, brazens reproaches self-distrust self-reproach. See careless, almost patronising, air he barely notices master passing him. He flung slight nod Power, studiously taking care notice Walter all. Look, too, boys him; boys like see him; idle lot, precocious folly vice. And little fellow, seems his especial favourite, taste; he seems coolest all. For last years Kenrick entirely lost his balance; he deserted his best friends adulation younger boys, fed his vanity, society elder boys, perverted his thoughts, vitiated his habits. He slackened career honourable industry, he deflected straight paths integrity virtue. Already fresh eagerness youth palled satiety, already sparkling-wine bitter vinegar; already pleasure become hectic fever instead healthy glow. Alas! he happy. Within two years he lost--and his countenance betrays fact ruined beauty--he lost true joys youth, known instead troubles envious, fears cowardly, heaviness slothful, shame unclean. He lost something instinctive shrinking, even thought, vile base, loathing falsehood, kindness willingly give pain, humility lowly thoughts worth; he lost his joy things lovely, excellent, good report; he changed mirth fools, like crackling thorns--changed feet go death, steps lay hold hell. It mean price he sold his peace conscience--"the sweetness cup charged poison, beauty serpent whose bite death." Eden, seated reading one benches wall, recovered his illness, he not, never be, what, Harpour's brutality, he might been. He nervous, timid, intellectual boy. No game, unfortunately, attraction him. The large liquid eyes, swimming sometimes strange lustre, often varying colour, delicate flush pulse emotion drives glowing somewhat pale face, give almost girlish aspect, tell tale weakened constitution. Eden's development quite altered his fright; vivacity playfulness his character vanished; although flashes pleasant mirth he alone his closest friends, Walter Power, his manner is, part, quiet reserved. Yet Eden position his school; unobtrusive he is, his opinion always listened kindness respect. When he came school his recovery he received, I said already, almost brotherly affection boys, felt much he wronged. He became child protege school, cruelty _him_ would, this, violently resented. Devoting wholly work reading, he became successful his progress, second fifth. But chiefly marks his extreme gentleness, eager way he strives help younger helpless boys. Experience suffering given keen sympathy oppressed, young he he still useful work. There Harpour playing rackets, he playing remarkably well. He nineteen, personage immense importance school, he head cricket eleven, Walter head football. Harpour quite unchanged, he mischief knew two years ago, he twice much mischief now. His influence unmitigatedly pernicious. With enough cunning skill escape detection, he yet signalises complicity every form wrong goes school, new wrongs he introduces invents. But nothing delights much instigate boys resist authority masters. They know nucleus disorder wickedness, he acted consummate ingenuity avoid even laying open distinct proof his many offences. He stopping minute his game talk three boys, strutting court arm arm, easily recognise. The one red puffy face, enormous gold pin his cravat, bunch charms hanging his chain, ring his hand, he loses opportunity displaying, friend Jones, vulgarity usual stamped every feature, displayed every movement he makes; tall slim fellow, air feeble fastness, indecisive mouth, habit running his hand his light-coloured hair, gaze usually settles fixed admiration his faultless boots, one Howard Tracy; third, fellow far meaning strength his face, betrays Mackworth, insinuating plausibility Belial-like grace his manner aspect. A dangerous serpent this; one never sees him, hears speak, observes dark glitter his eye, without reminded cerastes lythely rustling dry grass towards victim. And last--I thought never see him--is dear young joker jokes, unaltered Flip know, running school steps. His face overflowing mirth fun, he stopping holding his sides laughter, while, little touches his own, he retails strange blunders Bliss made _viva voce_ examination morning; his friend Whalley listens good-humoured smile he old. Henderson perfect mimic, never uses his powers mimicry ill-natured spirit; his imitation Bliss's stolid perplexity Dr Lane's comments ludicrous. While he middle narrative, Bliss appears scene relieves his feelings delivering pun he ever made his life, observing, solemn tone voice-- "Flip, do not flippant;" remark he substituted "I will lick you, Flip," old days. "You dear old Blissidas, I _think_ I have heard pun twice before," observes Henderson, calmly pulling undone bow Bliss's necktie, running escape retaliation, followed his leisure Whalley, knows Bliss much lazy pursue chase far. Let us come hear--for put cap darkness invisible, coming going like, unobserved--what four fast friends racket-court talking about. "We shall lots larks half," observes Harpour, leaning his racket. "Yes; fun, old boy," answers Jones. "I declare dull old place getting quite lively last holidays," says Mackworth; "we shall soon get things right here." "Fancy fellow Power head school," said Harpour, bursting roar scornful laughter, echoed faint sniggerings Jones Tracy. "Might well jug milk water head school," sneered Mackworth. "Or bottle French polish, I think," casually suggests Henderson, who, _en passant_, heard last remark. "Damn fellow," says Mackworth, stamping, "by Jove, I will even day." "Is he one new monitors?" asks Jones. "Yes," says Tracy, "and Evson's another;" Walter's name faces four grew darker; "and Kenrick's third." "O, Kenrick is, he? that is right. Jolly fellow Ken," observes Harpour, approvingly. "Yes, quite snuff," adds Jones; "and thorough gentlemanly chap," assents Mackworth; for, amazing relate, Kenrick good terms fellows now, though he never spoken Walter yet. "Of good family, too, mother's side," drawls Tracy, his hand lifting his locks. "I say, old fellows," says Harpour, many knowing looks winks, poking his friends ribs. "I say, stunning tap Dan's, know, eh? I say;" whereupon others laugh, Belial Mackworth observes, "And let monitors try peach dare. We will soon _them_ thumb." After which, conversation supremely repulsive, let us go take breath delicious pure sea air, seat Walter Power shore. Walter good, even gay spirits, fresh Semlyn, Power seems little grave depressed. "Look, Walter," he says, shying round stone bit embedded rock twenty yards them, missing it; "I believe identical rock--" "_That_ identical rock," said Walter, taking better shot, hitting it; "well, it?" "--On standing one autumn evening three years ago, tide coming in--" "And save wet trousers took shoes stockings, carried back," said Walter. "I remember well, Rex; happy day me. I recollect I would miserable; Paton affair, know, every one cutting me. Your coming speak last thing world I expected best thing I could hoped. I would often wanted know you, longed friend; I used lock young swell days I never thought meet other." "Pooh!" said Power; "but was not good break ice speak first? I declare, I think I have never done one else. _You'd_ never done it--now confess? Only fancy, might not known till day." "I should not done _that_ time," said Walter, "because I Coventry; but--well, never mind, Rex, understand other. I looking porpoises, I remember." "Yes; happy days that. I wish time back again! Fancy monitor, head school!" "Fancy! we have got school much faster used expect." "Yes; I wish could change places, head I sixth monitor are. You will help me, Walter, will not you?" "You do not doubt that, Rex, I am sure; _all_ help _I_ give yours." "If were not that, I think I would left, Walter. I do not think, somehow, I have influence enough head. I am swell enough games." "You play though now, enjoy them; I do not half believe you, Rex, talked wished leave. That would cowardice, know, you are boy leave post." "Here I place, armour on, visor down, determined fly, like Roman soldier whose skeleton found sentry box Pompeii," said Power, playfully getting assuming military attitude. "And I," said Walter, laughing, he stood beside one foot advanced--"I, sixth Hyperaspistes." "The sixth!--the _first_ mean," said Power. "The four monitors, me, will not, I fear, help us much. Browne short-sighted, always shutting headache; Smythe mere book-worm, regular butt even among little fellows--worse useless--no dignity anything else; Kenrick (for Kenrick far kept advantage his original start that, much he fallen work, Walter yet got him)--well, know Ken is!" "Yes, I know Ken now--_Hespemor en phthimenoir_--he is chief danger--a doubtful general camp. Hullo, Flip, _you_ here?" said he, Henderson came joined them. "Myself, O Evides; who is doubtful general camp?--not I, I hope." "You, Flip? no; Kenrick. We are talking monitors." "A doubtful general!--a traitor, mean, enemy, spy," said Henderson, hotly. "There, now, do not stop me, Power; abuse good safety-valve; scream steam-engine letting superfluous vapour. I dislike far worse I bottled silent spite, hated dark, did not openly abuse sometimes." Power's large gentle mind, Walter's generous temper prevented joining Henderson's strong language; felt less he that, work good school, Kenrick would dangerous, though declared, opponent. A monitor seemed recognise none monitor's duties, openly broke rules defied discipline, smoked went public-houses, habitually associated inferiors, least creditable set school, damage authority upper boys _any_ number external assaults consistent united among themselves. "I foresee storms ahead," said Power, sigh. "Flip, must stand well Walter." "Never fear," said Henderson; "but remember I am junior monitor lot, I am quick-tempered, I am always afraid stirring commotion day Harpoons"--as Henderson christened Harpour lot. "You must like lightning-kite then," said Power, "and turn flash away us." "`And dash beauteous terror ground, Smiling majestic,'" observed Henderson, parodying gesture, making others laugh. "Do remember Somers, Dimock, Danvers? What big fellows monitors used then!" said Power. "And remember certain boys Somers, Dimock, Danvers praised certain occasion?" said Walter. "Come, Rex, do not despond. We were not afraid then, now?" "But Macon, fellows like that, uphold school." "So _we_," said Henderson; "first foremost Whalley, who is got his remove upper sixth; there is dear old Blissidas, arms he has not got brains, staunch rock; best all, perhaps, there is Franklin, second elevens, brave lion, strong bull. By by, I lightning-kite ready made doubt; he is accustomed experiment." "Why, Flip, talk going pitched battle," said Power, ignoring his joke Franklin. "So are--practically morally. Look skirmishes Harpour lot; especially world, flesh, devil, I saw arm arm." "What _do_ mean, Flip?" asked Walter, laughing. "Mean! nothing all--only Tracy, Jones, Mackworth. Tracy's world, Jones flesh--raw flesh; Mackworth's thing." "I will tell two will not let school override us help it," said Walter; "Cradock Eden." "Briareus Paradise," said Henderson; "poor Eden, he cannot much us except look large troubled eyes." "Cannot he though, Flip? he is got good deal power." "He is got great deal good Power, I know, but--" "But do not donkey, Flip." "Do shut up. Why two expect dead assault monitors half?" said Power. "Why, fifth turbulent lot I ever knew before; big impudent fellows, good them, quite beck Harpour set," said Walter. "Yes, fellow Kenrick protagonist," said Henderson; "he Harpour always mischief monitors since caught tremendously Somers. Well, never mind; _aide toi et ciel t'aidera_. Why, look, there is Paradise, taking charge usual little new fellow; it?" "Look see," said Walter, little fellow came up, unmistakable family resemblance--a pretty boy, fresh round cheeks, light hair, shone like gold sunshine fell upon it. "Why, Walter--why, must brother. Well, I declare! Evides secundus, Evides redivivus. Just day came, made Jones look small three years ago. How do, young 'un?" He shook kindly hand said, "You are lucky little fellow monitor brother, Eden look first. I wish _I'd_ lucky, I know." "O Walter, _jolly_ place is," said his little brother,--"jollier Semlyn even." "Wait bit, Charlie; do not make mind soon," said Walter; Eden looked boy somewhat sad smile playing his lips. CHAPTER THIRTY ONE. AMONG THE NOELITES. But, I pray you, his companion? Is young squarer make voyage devil? Much Ado Nothing. Etiam si quis culpa vacuus amicitiam ejus inciderat, quotidiano usu per similisque ceteris efficiebatur.--Sallust. The changes described last chapter ones seriously affected prosperity Saint Winifred's School, stall masters also partly altered last two years, alterations improvements. Mr Paton--who time manfully resumed his old theological labours, who, please Walter, often employed willing amanuensis attempting replace burnt manuscript--had retired his mastership quiet country living he presented Sir Lawrence Power. Strange may seem, Mr Paton chiefly, though course indirectly, owed living Walter, first talked Sir Lawrence Mr Paton, terms deep regard. The opportunity, therefore, Walter sought earnestly, atoning way mischief he done his old master, amply granted him; Mr Paton never felt strongly, even deepest apparent evils God bring undoubted blessings. Saint Winifred's, however, loser his promotion. The benefit his impartial justice stern discipline, weight his firm manly character councils school, gone. And Saint Winifred's suffered still greater loss departure Mr Percival, accepted, months before, offer tutorship his university. Had he continued he was, his influence, his well-deserved popularity, his kind, wise, conciliatory manner, gratitude rewarded his ready self-denying sympathy, would, troubled period ensued, even useful his brilliant scholarship successful method teaching form. These two masters left amid universal regret boys colleagues, places filled younger, less able, less experienced men. And worse this, Dr Lane, soon term began, taken seriously ill, ordered German baths two months, his work done another master, influence. From causes, half-year Saint Winifreds turbulent, riotous, unhappy, ever known honourable ancient school. So little Charlie Evson soon found reason revise modify his opinion, Saint Winifred's--as he _then_ saw it--was jollier even Semlyn itself. His name entered list Mr Percival's house, known he going leave. Walter liked Mr Percival much better he his tutor, Mr Robertson, experienced much kindness, he thought would advantage Charlie placed directly wise kind friend; Mr Evson, afraid his little son would quite overshadowed his elder brother, Walter's influence, transcendent Charlie's mind, would make dependent another, prevent developing his natural character, means averse arrangement. But since Mr Percival left, Charlie, boys house, handed charge Mr Noel, new master, win his way learn his work, neither he succeeded he committed many mistakes. In house Kenrick Mackworth--Kenrick, monitor, measure responsible character house, he Charlie one his fags. At time, I already observed sorrow, Kenrick's influence useless good, even positively bad. There _no_ monitor try use his fags; many monitors, quiet kindnesses useful hints, judicious help unselfish sympathy, real service boys nominally "fagged" them, who, point fact, required nothing except taking occasional message, seeing study fires go out, carrying tea breakfast week each, order rotation. Few Saint Winifred's boys would hesitated admit would less happy, would fewer chances school-life, fags first, thereby found friends protectors boys fagged. Kenrick, however, follow good example become almost traditional; for, filled he spirit wilful pride, bad terms order he belonged, he either spoiled his fags petting pampering them, letting see his disregard duty, or, take his fancy, he snubbed disregarded them--at rate, nothing whatever help them. Kenrick quite willing placed Charlie Evson first classes, he boy impossible see like. His antagonistic position towards his body, made head sort faction school, he would proud beyond measure boy like Charlie one his followers. But Kenrick better reasons wishing attach Charlie himself. Deeply he degenerated, disgraceful his present conduct was, Kenrick, secret depths his soul, sighed pined better things; though vice, folly, pride attractions him, he still sick heart purer atmosphere he left. He looked Charlie vague hopes, he thought he might yet perhaps, without lowering his pride actually seeming made advance, bring reconciliation his best earliest friends, bring return his former upright course. But be. When boy goes wrong he strews every step his downward career obstacles his return; he little dreams difficult removal obstacles be. The obstacle case another little fag Kenrick's, named Wilton. I sorry write boy. Young years, he singularly old vice. A brazen, impudent, hardened little scapegrace--in schoolboy language, "a cooler hand"--it would impossible find. He early gained name Raven his artful looks. His manner mixture calm audacity consummate self-conceit. Though knew thorough scamp, young imp would stare face effrontery man town. He active, sharp, nice-looking, nothing he either afraid ashamed do. He particle modesty every good boy natural graceful; he could tell lie without slightest hesitation faintest blush; nay, he telling it, though _he_ knew _knew_ lie, he would abash instant cold glance his wicked dark eyes. Yet boy, like Charlie, thirteen years old. And reasons, Wilton idol big bad boys school; spite reasons--for boy fascination serpent--he declared favourite Kenrick too. The three boys gave tone Mr Noel's house, Kenrick, Mackworth, Wilton. They formed electric chain bad influence, severally prominent chief divisions school, peculiar opportunities harm. Kenrick's evil example told extraordinary power whole house, especially upon highest boys, naturally imitated him. I mean say Kenrick sunk low wilfully consciously he lowered character house, monitor he ought improved raised; he _did_ whether intention not; he negatively neglecting his duties, giving direct countenance right; he positively openly discountenancing, actually practising, many things he knew wrong. The bad work carried Mackworth, prominent fifth-form boy house. This boy's ability, strength will, keenness tongue, gave immense authority, enabled carry almost everything he liked. To complete mischief, among lower boys Wilton reigned supreme; Wilton prouder Kenrick's patronage anything else, flattery cajolery could win Kenrick nearly anything, worst part characters boys acting reacting other, leavened house least good, true, lovely, good report. The mischief began Mr Percival left, never could proceeded half far, Mr Noel's inexperience, kindness led relax existing discipline, tempted boys unwonted presumption. Such state things Charlie entered Mr Noel's house. Walter knew Mr Percival's promotion frustrated plan he formed he advised his father put Charlie house, step could recalled, nor, indeed, Walter monitor aware bad state things become. For among dangerous innovations, Mackworth Wilton brought kind understanding, house extent keep itself, resent intrusion precincts, maintain profound silence secrets. Besides this, Walter bitterly sorrowfully felt reason, he unable fathom, whole school unsatisfactory state, Charlie, his whole heart yearned brotherly love pity, would exposed severe temptations whatever house he placed. He hoped that, Charlie would always run his Power's study, would make little difference he different house master. To Mackworth Wilton arrival one two new boys matter importance, little anxiety. The new boys necessarily young, present united state house, tolerably certain would catch prevalent spirit, quickly assimilated condition others. The task moulding them-- difficult manage--fell Wilton, he certainly accomplished astonishing success. A newcomer's sensibilities quickly shocked. The Noelites, purposes, behaved kindly first; first-rate hands "destroying boy means his best affections," "seething kid mother's milk." The bad language, school trickeries deceits, dodges breaking rules escaping punishments, agreed-on lies avoid detection, suppers, brandy, smoking parties, false keys get lock-up, detestable symptoms vitiated depraved set, carefully kept abeyance first. The new fellow treated kindly, sounded fathomed cautiously, taught get strong house feeling perpetual endeavours wake _esprit de corps_, gently ridiculed he displayed good principle, tremendously bullied he showed signs recalcitrance, according his temperament led, coaxed, initiated, intimidated, condition wickedness required house could continue go devil, fast wished do, before. This Mackworth's work, Wilton acted his Azazel, Kenrick interfere, though he knew guessed going on; he interfere, he prevent it, he even remonstrate first, afterwards he began acquiescing, he ended by--yes, truth must told--he ended joining all. O Kenrick, human beings meet face face certain judgment-seat, young souls bill indictment you; may point Mackworth Wilton, say, old, "The serpent beguiled me, I eat." Five new boys come half-year. Four sounded rest house; one them, named Stone, come large private school, prepared whatever he might find senses one. Another, Symes, boy ill-trained home, particular principles, quite ready flow stream. A third, Hanley, come meaning good; he shocked he first heard oaths, he first asked he would mind telling regular lies--"crams" boys called them--in event master questioning him; his wounded sensibilities quickly healed, he passed fatal facility disgust indifference, indifference toleration. The fourth, Elgood, timid child, one cared either way, took care frighten promising whatever he ordered. A terrible state things--was not? But, ah me! upon time. The fifth new boy Mr Noel's house Charles Evson; fifth new boy devil's agents knew instinctively would great deal trouble. But meant bait hook carefully, despair. Their task made peculiarly piquant difficulty, fact Charlie one declared enemy, Walter Evson, nearly concerned. They determined fair means foul win over, make proselyte, he became much child sin themselves. But proceeded task utmost caution, endeavoured charm Charlie views showing great attention, trying make things pleasant him, flattering notice, seeming welcome cordially one themselves. Their dissimulation profound; first new boy found everything quite delightful, week caught, meant catch, spirit party, always ready stick Noelites best house school. So far good; first step initiation Eleusinian mysteries. So Master Wilton--Belial junior, Henderson always called him-- ingratiated Charlie's favour, tried, without success, make peculiarly agreeable. At first sight, indeed, Charlie felt inward repulsion him. He know _why_ he did, for, far anything obviously repulsive Wilton's look manners, many thought picture innocence, considered his manners quite perfection politeness good breeding. Charlie therefore instantly conquered his first feeling dislike uncharitable groundless; Wilton seemed lay his friendship, he oftener first fortnight boy. It strange see two together, utterly different every respect, great contrast Charlie's sweet, bright, modest face, indescribable dangerous coolness Wilton's knowing smile. "Look," said Henderson Whalley, he saw together one day playground; "there go Ithuriel Belial junior, thick present." "Yes; I do not like see it. I do not hear good fellow Wilton." "Good! I rather think not!" "Give young Evson hint, Flip, you, Wilton's good friend him. He looks nice little fellow, I do not like tell him, I do not know him." "Never fear; Charlie touches his spear, sees light top Niphates--one things happen soon enough-- he will slow discover he is. If not, I will tell Walter, he shall Charlie's Uriel." "Touches his spear!--what spear?--top Niphates!--Uriel!" said Whalley, ludicrous astonishment; "here, Power, you are time help put strait-waistcoat Flip. He says Wilton lights top Niphates, he soon, young Evson discover he is scamp. What _does_ mean?" "It means Flip I reading Paradise Lost," said Power, laughing, "and present Flip's mind Miltonic conglomerate." And he proceeded explain Whalley Ithuriel one Cherubs guarded Eden-- ("Only case Eden guards cherub," observed Henderson, parenthetically.) "--and who, touching Satan his spear, made bound his original state, he sat like toad squat ear Eve, and, moreover, Uriel recognised Satan his mask, when, lighting Niphates, his looks became `Alien heaven, passions foul obscured.'" "Seriously, though," said Henderson, "Uriel must asleep, he would not let his little brother get Belial's wings." In fact, Wilton forced keep mask much longer he ever meant do. He could find joint Charlie's armour. The boy thoroughly manly, simple-hearted, trustful innocent, Wilton could make nothing him. If he tried indoctrinate Charlie state morality among Noelites, either Charlie understand him, else quite openly expressed his disapproval even indignation; finally Wilton quite tired out, throw mask, Charlie shook away him, turned sickening sensation unbared features vice, unfeignedly loathed boy pretended his friend--loathed he tried like him, saw snare spread his sight. Every early intercourse Charlie felt certain restraint talking Wilton; he could ease though he tried. He caught gleam snake flowers half concealed his folds. And Wilton, too, got tired playing part. He could help his real wickedness cropping then, yet whenever did, Charlie started way even Wilton ashamed; though generally shafts conscience glanced panoply steel ice cased boy's heart, yet days twice reached mark, made smart long-unwonted anguish. He conscious he devil's work, poor wages, he felt Charlie's immense superiority himself, and, mood pity, when, standing one day Mr Noel's private room say lesson, he caught sight two selves reflected looking-glass mantelpiece, realised immense gulf separated them--a gulf void chaos flaming space, deeper gulf warped affections sinful thoughts--he felt sudden longing he was, Charlie true friend, give trying make bad boy, fall his feet ask his pardon. And he doggedly failed his lesson, got his customary bad mark, customary punishment, received his customary objurgation, he getting worse worse, his time utterly wasted--and he saw master's face light pleased expression Charlie went cheerfully faultlessly his work--a sudden paroxysm penitence seized Wilton, and, room, he left Charlie ran stairs Kenrick's study, he allowed sit whenever he liked. No one there, throwing chair, Wilton covered his face hands, burst passionate tears. A long train thoughts memories passed his mind--memories his headlong fall he was, memories younger innocent days, memories father, dead, often set his knee, prayed, things, he might grow good truthful boy, stain upon his name. But memory whispered past innocence, conscience told present guilt; told his father could foreseen he would become, his heart would broken; told him, he knew it, his name proverb byeword school. But prominent recurring thought ever this--"Is late mend? Is door shut me?" For Wilton remembered his mind harrowed fear guilt he listened Mr Percival's parting sermon sad text--one saddest Holy Book--"_And door shut_." Suddenly he startled violently his reverie, door _was_ shut bang, Kenrick, entering, flung chair, saying, vexed expression voice, "Too late." It set verses Kenrick written prize exercise, he sent late. He lost ambition, he real friend inspirit stimulate him, he often procrastinated, seldom successful anything. But his accidental words fell awful meaning strange emphasis poor Wilton's ear. Wilton never heard Bath Kol, he knew nothing power wields tongue amid chances destiny; fear made superstitious, and, forgetting his usual dissimulation, he looked Kenrick aghast, without wiping away traces unwonted tears left upon his face. "Why, Raven, boy, what is matter?" asked Kenrick, looking astonishment; "much _you_ care set iambics late." "Oh, all?" asked Wilton, still looking frightened. "All? Yes; enough, too, me. But"--stopping suddenly--"why, Raven, what is row? You have crying, that is odd! Why, I did not know you would ever she would tear since you would cradle. Raven crying--what notion! Crocodile tears, eh?" Wilton ashamed caught crying, angry laughed at. He leaving room silently pet, Kenrick caught him, and, looking him, said kindlier tone-- "Nonsense, Ra; do not mind little chaff. What is happened? Nothing serious, I hope?" But Wilton angry miserable then, struggled get free. He venture tell Kenrick really passing his mind. "Let go," he said, struggling get free. "O, go, means," said Kenrick, his pride fire moment; "do not suppose I want care you;" he turned his back Wilton, he never spoken harshly before. The current Wilton's thoughts turned; he really loved Kenrick, person he regard all. Besides, Kenrick's support favour everything then, he stopped irresolutely door, unwilling leave anger. "What want? Why do not go?" asked Kenrick, his back still turned. Wilton came back window, humbly took Kenrick's hand, looking though ask forgiveness. "How odd to-day, Raven," said Kenrick, relenting. "What crying I came in?" "Well, I will tell you, Ken. I thinking much better fellows I am, whether _too late_ begin afresh, whether door _was open_ still, came in, said, `Too late,' banged door, I took answer thoughts." They first serious words Kenrick ever heard Wilton; he choose heed them, said, pause-- "Other fellows better you? Not bit it. Less plucky, perhaps; greater hypocrites, certainly; jolliest all, Ra." And silly, silly speech Wilton reassured; gratified smile perched upon his lips, his eyes sparkled delight; he soon revisited qualms conscience. CHAPTER THIRTY TWO. DISENCHANTMENT. "How get young Evson, Ra?" asked Mackworth Wilton, sneer. "Not all," said Wilton. "He is awfully particular strait-laced, like brother his. No fun he is house." "Confound him," said Mackworth, frowning darkly; "if he does not like he sees, he must lump it. He is worth trouble." "So, Mack, _you_ discovered he is like." "Yes, I have," answered Mackworth savagely. For his polish, his courtesies, civilities succeeded making Charlie conceal much he feared disliked him. The young horse rears first time hears adder's hiss, dove's eye trembles instinctively hawk near. Charlie half knew half guessed kind character he deal with, made Mackworth hate deadly hatred way which, without one particle rudeness conceit, he managed keep distance, check every approach intimacy. With Kenrick case different. Charlie thought he looked one nicest best fellows house, he could get fact Wilton his favourite. It Wilton's constant daily boast Ken would anything him; Charlie felt Wilton boy Walter Power rate would even tolerated, much less liked. It made receive Kenrick's advances shyness coldness; Kenrick observed this, he concluded Charlie set Walter, he would report Walter he said. This belief galling wormwood. Suddenly, insulting publicity, he turned Charlie one his fags, time never spoke without sneer, never spoke all. Meanwhile, term advanced, Saint Winifred's gradually revealed Charlie unfavourable light. The discipline school impaired state; evening work grew disorderly; monitors duty vigour, big idle fellows fifth set example insolence towards rudeness masters. All rules set defiance impunity, chaos ensued, every one right his eyes. One evening, evening work, Charlie trying hard verses set his form. He found difficult noise going on. Not half dozen fellows room working attempting work; talking, laughing, rattling desks, playing tricks other, throwing books room. The one bewildered new master, nominally kept order among two hundred boys room, walked despair, speaking vain first one, another, almost giving farce attempting maintain silence. But seeing Charlie seriously work he came asked he could give assistance. Charlie gratefully thanked him, master sat try smooth his difficulties. His sign audible titter, attempt suppress; he passed on, Wilton, whose conduct impertinent one else, said Charlie-- "I say, young Evson, grinding." "I verses do," said Charlie simply. "Ha! ha! ha!" laughed Wilton, though he made good joke. "Here, shall I give wrinkle?" "Yes, it is allowed." The answer greeted another laugh, Wilton said, "I will save trouble, young 'un. Observe dodge; we are it." He put white handkerchief his nose, walking master said, "Please, sir, nose bleeding. May I go minute?" "Your nose bleeding? That is third time nose bled week, boys also come noses bleeding." "Do doubt word, sir?" asked Wilton, his handkerchief still held up, assuming injured air. "I sorry give reason," answered master, courteously. "It seems strange circumstance, may go." It would easy see whether his nose bleeding not, master trying, unsuccessfully present, whether implicit confidence would produce sense honour among boys. Wilton went hardly concealing his laughter, ten minutes returned verses, finished written out. "There," he said, "Ken me; he knocked five minutes. Ken's awfully clever fellow, though he never opens book. Do not bore verses more; I will get done you." Charlie glanced paper, saw verses perfectly done. "Do mean show copy own, Wilton?" "Of course I do." "But marked them." "Hear! hear! thanks information. So much better. I shall get jolly good mark." "Shut up, young innocence, do not muff," said another Noelite. "We thing. Take heaven sends glad get it." "Thank you," said Charlie, looking round; "you may, I would rather not. It is not fair." "Oh, good are! sweet are! angel are!" said Wilton, turning whites his eyes, rest applauded him. But meant jeers tell Charlie's resolution, mistaken. He looked quietly round his clear eyes, gravely handed paper back Wilton, quietly resumed his work. They angry foiled, determined that, he would copy verses, he least way. One took his paper tore it, another split his quill pens dashing desk, third seized his dictionary. The master, observing something going desk, came stood by; long he there, Charlie managed write he done, others, cunningly inserting occasional mistake, altering epithets, copied verses Kenrick done Wilton. But directly master turned away again, boy opposite side table, utmost deliberation, took hold Charlie's fair copy, emptied inkstand three four separate streams. Vexed he was--for time he never known unkindness--he took quietly good-humouredly. Next morning, rest boys his dormitory, mainly his form, aware he meant do, he got early went Walter's study, hoping write verses memory. But he found study possession housemaid; chapel-bell rang, chapel he went morning school exercise unfinished. For this, he, boy form attempted his duty, received punishment, rest looked unabashed, got marks stolen work. Wilton received nearly full marks his. The master, Mr Paton's successor, thought odd Wilton could his verses much better his work, he could detect cheating, Wilton always assured verses entirely his composition. It time now, Wilton thought, hoist his true colours; but, he abundance brass, he followed Charlie schoolroom, talked familiarly, nothing happened, finally took his arm. But much; boy, open day his dealings, withdrew his arm, standing still, looked full face. "So!" said Wilton, "now take choice--friends enemies--which shall be?" "If want cheat, tell lies, mean--not _friends_." "So! enemies then, mind. Look squalls, young Evson. One question, though," said Wilton, Charlie turned away. "Well?" "Are going sneak brother?" Charlie silent. Without intention procuring Walter's interference, he _had_ meant talk his difficulties, ask his advice. But stigmatised sneaking he felt he rather it, action boy fears more, considers mean this. "Oh, I see," said Wilton; "you _do_ mean peach, blab, tell tales, you? Well, do not matter much; you will find he precious little; worse long-run." "I shall not tell him," said Charlie, shortly; words sealed his lips, heavy heart he entered breakfast-room, meditated troubles come. Which troubles came quite fast enough--very fast indeed. For house, rather leading spirits it, thought wasted quite enough time, quite sufficient success angling new boys, determined resume without delay ordinary courses. If Charlie fool enough resist them, said, much worse him. During day, indeed, he saved many annoyances Walter obliged endure, escaping Great Schoolroom happy quiet refuge Walter's, Power's Eden's study. There he could always unmolested, enjoy kindness he treated, cheerful, healthy atmosphere contrasted strangely moral sweetness turbid polluted air Noelite society. But evening Preparation, afterwards dormitories, he wholly mercy bad confederacy tried mould will. He large dormitory ten boys, principal room Mr Noel's house, formed regular refuge every night idle mischievously inclined. When candles put bed-time seldom long relit room--which somewhat remote others, end long corridor, window opened secluded part Dr Lane's garden. If scout placed end corridor he could give timely warning danger, chance detection small. Had candles relit game play, Charlie would first join fun. But Noelites far vitiated taste long content mere bolstering harmless games. It seemed Charlie candles relit chiefly purpose eating drinking forbidden things, playing cards, bullying tormenting boys least advanced general wickedness. "I say, young Evson," said Wilton one night soon fracas narrated, "we are going fun to-night. Stone, like brick he is, stood couple bottles wine, Hanley cards. We shall smoke too." All said tone braggadocio, meant exceedingly telling, made Charlie feel he loathed swaggering little boy his premature _savoir vivre_, more. He understood, too, hint two new fellows contributed house carousal, fully expected he would asked next. He secretly, however, determined refuse, he knew well mere harmless feast intended, rather smoking drinking bout. He subscribed liberally legitimate funds--the football, racquet court, gymnasium; he saw reason he taxed things he disliked disapproved. The result evening confirmed his resolution. It scene drinking, gluttony, secret fear, endless squabbling, joyless excitement. "Of course you will play, put pool?" said Wilton. "No, thank you." "No, _thank you_," said Wilton, scornfully mimicking his tone. "Of course not; you will nothing except set saint, make disagreeable." During evening Stone brought wine, Charlie declined, "No, thank you, Stone." Wilton echoed refusal, chorused dozen others; time Charlie duly dubbed nickname "No-thank-you." He forcibly christened new name, held bed half wine-glass port thrown his face. The wine poured stained his night-shirt, began dread would lead discovered, threatened Charlie endless penalties he dared tell. There was, however, little danger, Noelites bribed servants waited cleaned rooms. The scene, slight variations, constantly repeated, every fresh refusal accompanied kick cuff bigger boys, sneer insult younger; Charlie one youngest all. One night was, "I say, fellow--you, No-thank-you--will fork wine to-night? No? Well then, take that, hung little muff." Another time would be, "Hi there, No-thank-you--we want sixpence pack cards. Oh, will not sinful part sixpence cards? Confounded little miser;" "Niggard," said another; "Skinflint," shouted third. And general cry "Saint," expressed climax villainy, ended verbal portion contest. And then, one would slap cheek, "take that", "and that," another, "and that," third--the last boot piece soap shied his head. It cannot wearisome reader linger coarse scenes; but, Charlie, long martyrdom heroically borne. He almost literally alone single-handed rest house; yet he would give way. Walter, Power, Henderson, knew he bullied, sorely bullied; learnt far Eden, sources, Charlie himself, he, poor child, held bound his promise Wilton, kept his lips resolutely sealed. But friends knew he suffering conscience sake; Walter helped tender, brotherly affection, Power brave words kindly sympathy, well noble example, Henderson his cheering playful manner; caused much happiness day long, he felt that, short heart-uttered prayer he breathed earnestly "the altar his bedside," he strength sufficient meet conquer trials night brought. In house one boy one helped him. That boy _ought_ Kenrick; his monitorial authority many responsible privileges entrusted him, he well knew, main express purpose putting immorality, cruelty, strong remorseless hand. It required little courage this; sympathies majority boys, unless suffered grow corrupted evil leaven, naturally strongly side right. In Mr Robertson's house, instance, Walter Henderson monitors, wrong-doings could gone impunity, rather could gone all. There, little boy, treated gross severity injustice, would hesitated instant invoke assistance monitors, he looked upon his natural guardians, would eager extend generous efficient protection. The case Mr Edwardes's house, Power head. Power, indeed, coadjutor he could rely. One monitors associated Legrange, rather followed Kenrick's lead, Brown, who, though well-intentioned, boy authority. Yet two houses better condition others school, heads duty; slight credit Walter Henderson house stood higher character other, although contained Harpour Jones. This could case two worthies found powerful counterpoise two fifth-form fellows, Franklin Cradock, whose excellence almost solely due Walter's influence. Kenrick, hand, never interfered house, let things go exactly liked, although going rack ruin. Charlie's sole friend helper house was, Kenrick, Bliss. Poor Bliss quite belied his name, his school work, he never could effort succeed, kept state lugubrious disappointment. Bliss lived dim kind life, seeing sorts young boys get beat race, vaguely groping thick mental darkness. Do he could stream knowledge fled his tantalised lip whenever he stooped drink; fruits, others plucked easily, sprang his reach he tried touch bough. He constantly crushed desolating sense his stupidity; yet his good temper charming his trials, he loved grateful humility tolerated his shortcomings. For reason he sincere affection Henderson, plagued him, indeed, incessantly, never unkind insulting way; made teasing patient constant help, without Bliss would succeeded even well he did. Bliss strong active fellow, good games, school he got well; but, nevertheless, he generally set nearly half-witted--a mere dolt. Dolt not, he Charlie inestimable service; boy like case Bliss, let take courage, even merest dolt immense power good well harm, Bliss extended Charlie gentle manly sympathy many clever boy might envied. He knew Charlie ill-used. Not dormitory, joining little house concerns, he able interfere directly his aid; he never failed encourage resist iniquity every kind. "Hold out, young Evson," he would often say him; "you are good, brave little chap, do not give in; you are right wrong; right might, sure that." It something days meet approbation well-doing among Noelites; Charlie, genuine gratitude, never forgot Bliss's kind support; till Bliss left Saint Winifred's continued firm friends fast. "Have made friends house?" asked Mr Noel Charlie one occasion; he often seized opportunity talking his younger boys, he felt sincere interest, he would gladly shielded temptation utmost his power, he known he unhappily ignorant--the bad state things among boys his care. "Not many, sir," said Charlie. "Have not you? I am sorry hear that. I like see boys forming friendships future life; nice fellows house. Wilton, instance, do not like him? He is idle volatile, I know, still he seems pleasant boy." Charlie could hardly suppress smile, said nothing; Mr Noel continued, "Who chief friend, Evson, among boys?" "Bliss, sir," said Charlie, alacrity. "Bliss!" answered Mr Noel surprise. "What makes like much? Is he backward stupid?" But Charlie would hear word Bliss, speaking open trustfulness new boy, he exclaimed, "O sir, Bliss excellent fellow; I wish many like him; he is capital fellow, sir, I like much; he is best fellow house, one stands I trouble." "Well, I am glad you have found _one_ friend, Evson," said Mr Noel; "no matter he is." One way Bliss showed his friendship going privately Kenrick, complaining way Charlie bullied. "Why do not interfere, Kenrick?" he asked. "Interfere, pooh! It young cub good; he is conceited, half." "I never saw little fellow _less_ conceited, anyhow." Kenrick stared him. "What business yours, I like know?" "It _is_ business mine; he good little fellow, he is kicked others cannot make bad lot themselves; there is Wilton--" "Shut Wilton, he is friend mine." "Then shame you," said Bliss. "He is worth fifty chickens little Evson, day." "Chickens!" said Bliss, tone nearly like contempt he ever assumed; "it is clear do not know much him; I wish, Kenrick, you would duty more, house would bad is." Kenrick opened his eyes wide; he never heard Bliss speak like before. "I do not want learned, clever, profound Bliss teach _me my_ duty," he said, proud sneer; "what business abuse house, full young ninnies like Evson? You are monitor mine, let tell you." "You may sneer, Kenrick, stupid, like; but, cleverness, I would not something; will not interfere, ought, _I will_, I can." And Bliss said this, clear flaming anger, fixed Kenrick his eyes, lighted honest purpose, Kenrick thought he never seen look handsome, fine fellow. "Yes, even _he_ superior now," he thought, sigh, Bliss left room. Poor Ken-- unhappier boy Saint Winifred's; he ate ate ashy fruits sin, grew dusty bitter his parched taste; he drank napthaline river wayward pride, scorched his heart _not_ quench his thirst. CHAPTER THIRTY THREE. MARTYRDOM. "Since thou deeply dost enquire, I instruct thee briefly dread Hinders entrance here. Those things alone Are feared whence evil may proceed, Nought else, nought terrible beside." Carey's _Dante_. Gradually persecutions Charlie subjected mainly turned one point. His tormentors far tired bullying him, would left comparative peace he would yielded one point--which this. The Noelites accustomed grand evening "spread" called it, finished supper, usually supplied Dan, generally began smoking, amusement could enjoy lights out. The smokers used sit long corridor, which, I said, led dormitory, scout always posted warn approaching danger; begin operations till master gone his nightly rounds, quiet it, much danger disturbed. Yet although windows corridor dormitory left wide open, every precaution taken, impossible get rid fumes tobacco entirely avoid chance detection. They had, indeed, bribed servants secrecy, feared detected master. The Noelites, therefore, dormitory accustomed agree questioned master smell smoking, would deny smoking taken place. The nine boys dormitory, doubtful exception Elgood, promised would stick assertion case asked. The question was, "Would Charlie promise thing?" If not, boys felt doubly insecure--insecure stability falsehood secrecy proceedings. And Charlie Evson, course, refused promise this. Single-handed he fought battle boys his house, spite solicitation, coaxing, entreaty, threats blows, steadily declared he tell-tale, he never mentioned anything gone house, _if he directly asked_ whether particular act taken place not, he would still keep silence, _could would not_ tell lie. Now house--and especially Mackworth Wilton--had determined, help rest, crush opposition, conquer obstinacy, called it; and, since Charlie's reluctance could overcome persuasion argument, break sheer force. So, night night, number gathered round Charlie, tried every means ingenuity malice could suggest make yield one point; so, well knew gain one concession practically gain all, Charlie's uprightness contrasted unpleasantly base compliances, his mere presence among became, circumstance, constant annoyance. One boy high firm moral standard, steadily consistently good, hardly fail unpopular large house full bad reckless boys. It long hard struggle; long Charlie felt would last ever, his strength would give way he wearied-out his persecutors. For seemed positive amusement, pleasant occupation them, night night, bully him. He dreaded, he shuddered return evening; he knew well time Preparation began, till rest asleep, he could look little peace. Sometimes he tempted yield. He knew bottom fellows really hate him, he might popular he chose, even without going nearly lengths others, he would promise tell, his assent would hailed acclamations. Besides, said tempter, chances strongly favour asked matter, every probability called upon tell "cram;" delicate distinction falsehood presented guise "cram," naked lie; _that_ word boys carefully avoided applying it, quite angry Charlie called right name. One evening poor little fellow weary hopeless sad heart, he thrashed long severely, he _very_ near yielding. A paper written, signing tacitly understood involve promise deny smoking night taxed it; boys except Elgood Charlie signed paper. But fellows care Elgood; knew he dared oppose long, could make bidding whenever time came. Well, one evening, Charlie, weak mood, verge signing paper, thus purchasing cessation long series injuries taunts he suffering. He sitting bed, taken pencil hand sign his name. The boys, eager group round him, calling regular brick, encouraging him, patting back, saying sure along he nice little fellow, would come round last. Elgood among them, looking anxious eyes. He immensely admired Charlie's brave firmness, nothing reliance strength his stronger encouraged shadow opposition. "If young Evson it," he whispered, "I directly." Charlie caught whisper; agony shame flung away pencil. He nearly sinned himself, forgotten resolution granted answer his many prayers; he seen effects bad example, nothing induce lead others sin. "Lead us temptation, deliver us evil," instant supplication rose his inmost heart, he threw pencil pushed paper aside. "I _can't_ it," he said; "I _must_ it; I never told lie life I remember. Do not ask more." Instantly tone temper boys changed. A shower words, I repeat, assailed his ears; he dragged bed thrashed unmercifully he ever before. "You shall give way end, mind that," last admonition he received one bigger fellows, he dragged his bed, sobbing pain, aching disquietude heart. "The sooner better; little muffs would-be saints do not go us." And evenings, candles put out, fellows nothing better do, used regular thing one suggest, "Come, let us _bait_ No-thank-you; it will rare fun." Then another would say, "Come, No-thank-you, sign paper like good fellow, spare rest." "Do," another insidious friend would add; "I quite sorry see kicked thrashed often." "I will strike light one second will," suggested fourth. "No, will not? oh, then, look out, Master No-thank-you, look squalls." But still, however beaten insulted, holding like man, letting tears fall he could help it, though swam his eyes pain grief, brave boy resisted evil, would forced stain his white soul promise lie. There who, though dared say anything, yet looked struggle mingled shame admiration--shame themselves, admiration Charlie. It could hearts among many seared tender nerves pity, Charlie saw kindly faces looking cowardly group tormentors, heard timid words disapprobation spoken worst bullied him. More often, too, young Noelite met day would seem address changed nature, would speak warmly friendliness, would show little words actions he felt respected him, although he courage enough resist publicly opposing stream. And others baser sort observed this. What one little new fellow beat all, end domination, introduce spite truer better natural state things? tolerated moment, he must put strong hand once. Meanwhile Charlie's heart fast failing him, dying away within him; persecution his health spirits worn out. His face, noticed, far paler he came, his looks almost haggard, his manner less sprightly before. He honourably abstained hitherto giving Walter direct account his troubles, he yearned advice comfort, went Walter's study, complain, ask Walter thought chance his father removing another school, he felt Saint Winifred's he could neither happy way succeed. "Well, Charlie boy, I you?" said Walter, cheerfully pushing away Greek Lexicon Aristophanes he engaged, wheeling round armchair fire, he poked till bright blaze. "Am I disturbing work, Walter?" said little boy, whose dejected air his brother noticed. "No, Charlie, bit; _you_ never disturb me. I thinking time shut up, it is almost dark read, we have nearly half hour tea-time; come sit knee chat. I have not seen age, Charlie." Charlie said nothing, he weary mood, glad sit his brother's knee put his arm round his neck; he four years Walter's junior, never left home before, night homesickness strongly upon him. "Why, what is matter, Charlie boy?" asked Walter playfully. "What is meaning pale face red eyes? I am afraid have not found Saint Winifred's jolly expected; disenchanted already, eh?" "O Walter, I am very, miserable," said Charlie, overcome his brother's tender manner towards him; leaning his head Walter's shoulder he sobbed aloud. "What it, Charlie?" said Walter, gently stroking his light hair. "Never afraid tell anything. You have done nothing wrong, I hope?" "O no, Walter. It is I will not wrong bully me." "Is it? Then dry tears, Charlie boy, may thank God, nothing earth earth _make_ wrong determine not--determine right way, know, Charlie." "But it is hard, Walter; I did not know would _very_ hard. The house bad, one helps except Bliss. I do not think ever troubled I am, Walter." "Never mind, Charlie. Only do not go wrong whatever you. You do not know much smooth way rest school-life. It is quite true say, Charlie, state school far worse ever knew it; that is reason duty, is not it." "O Walter, I _know_ they will make wrong day. I wish I home. I wish I might leave. I get thrashed kicked abused every night, Walter, almost night long." "_Do_ you?" asked Walter, angry amazement. "I knew rather bullied--Eden told that--but I never knew bad say. By jove, Charlie, I like catch one bullying you, and--well, I will warrant he should not again." "O, I forgot, Walter, I ought not told you; made promise not. Only _is_ wretched." "Never mind, poor little Charlie," said Walter. "Do what is right shame devil. I will see I cannot devise way helping you; anyhow, hold till end term, doubt papa take away still wish it. But I without you, Charlie?" "You are dear, dear good brother," said Charlie, gratefully; "and you, Walter, I given long ago." "No, Charlie, me, truer friend even I be, though I love heart. But promise one thing faithfully?" "Yes, I will." "Well, promise that, will, shall not make tell lie, anything else know wrong." "I will promise you, Walter, I can," said little boy humbly; "but I have best long time." "You _couldn't_ tell lie, Charlie boy, without found out; _that_ I feel sure of," said Walter, smiling, he held his brother's ingenuous face his hands, looked it. "I do not doubt instant; I will talk Power you. As head school he may able something, perhaps. It is Kenrick's duty properly, but--" "Kenrick, Walter? He is use; he let us house likes, I think he must taken dislike me, he turned quite roughly his fag." "Never mind one else, Charlie. You are brave little fellow, I am proud you. There is tea-bell; come me." "Ah, Walter, it is evenings you are away I get pitched into. If I house you, jolly would be." And he looked wistfully his brother parted door hall, Walter walked chief table monitors sat, he went find place among boys his form house. He found poured his tea his plate his bread butter, he got little eat drink evening. It dark streamed tea go Preparation-room, he heard Elgood's tremulous voice saying him, "Oh, Evson, shall give way to-night, sign?" "Why to-night particular, Elgood?" "Because I have heard say they are going grand gathering to-night, make you, too; I cannot hold do, Evson." "I shall try give way; indeed, I _won't_ made tell lie," said Charlie, thinking his interview Walter, hopes inspired. "Then _I_ will not either," said Elgood, plucking courage. "But shall catch awfully, us." "They cannot lick us," said Charlie, trying speak cheerily, "and I have licked often I am getting accustomed it." "And I would rather licked," said voice beside them, "and like two fellows, escape licked, like Stone Symes, even like myself." "Who is that?" asked Elgood hastily, light enough see. "Me--Hanley. Do not fellows give in; make miserable, done me." They went Preparation, succeeded chapel, dormitories. They undressed got bed, usual, although knew soon disturbed, various signs told rest task hand. Accordingly, lights barely put out, scout posted, candles re-lighted, number Noelites, headed Mackworth, came crowding dormitory. "Now you, No-thank-you, you have got one last chance--here is paper sign; fellows always signed before, _you_ shall too, whether like no. We are going alter rules you. We want supper day two, cannot sneaking it." Mackworth speaker. "I do not want sneak," said Charlie firmly; "you have making wretched, knocking about, weeks, I have never told yet." "We do not want orations; Yes No--will sign?" "Stop," said Wilton, "here is another fellow, Mac, has not signed;" he dragged Elgood bed one arm. "Oh, _you_ have not signed, have not you? Well, shall make short work you. Here is pencil, here is paper, here is place name. Now, poor little fool, sign without giving us trouble." Elgood trembled hesitated. "Look here," said Mackworth brutally; "I do not want break butterfly upon wheel, but--how like that?" He drew cane behind his back, brought sharply Elgood's knuckles, who, turning white, sat scrawled his name hastily paper; sooner he done than, looking up, he caught Charlie's pitying glance upon him, running pencil his signature, said more, pushed paper hastily away cowered down, expecting another blow, Charlie whispered, "Courage." "You must take fellow first, Mac, want get on," suggested Wilton. "Evson, friend, I advise refuse." "_As friend_!" said Charlie, simple scorn, looking full Wilton. "You friend mine; and, Wilton, I would not even change places you." "Would not you?--Pitch him, Mac. And you," he said Elgood, "you may wait present." He administered backhander Elgood he spoke, next minute Charlie, roused beyond bearing, knocked down. Twenty times he would tempted fight Wilton, he could reckoned upon fair play; he could stand his person intolerable witness applied another. Wilton sprang perfect fury, fight began; Mackworth pulled Charlie off, said, "Fight another time, condescend so, Raven; do not see it is mere dodge his get off. Now, No-thank-you, time come deeds; we have words enough. You stand there." He pushed Charlie front him. "Now, sign?" "_Never_," said Charlie, low firm tone. "Then--" "_Not cane, cane_, Mackworth," cried several voices agitation, time prevent cane descending heavy hand across child's back. Charlie's one fine, nervous, susceptible temperaments, feel every physical sensation, every mental emotion, tenfold severity. During whole scene; painfully anticipated, he stood alone among group boys, whose sole object seemed show hatred, twice strong himself, his feelings highly wrought; though he many opportunities late train his delicate organisation manly endurance, yet sudden anguish unexpected blow quite conquered him. A thrilling cry broke his lips, next moment, cane tore his shoulders, fit violent hysteria supervened, alarmed brutes trying master his noble resolution. And crisis door burst open sudden crash, Bliss entered state burning indignation, followed slowly Kenrick. "O, I late," he said, stamping his foot; "what _have_ little fellow?" thrusting aside, he took Charlie his arms, gradually soothed calmed till his wild sobs laughter hushed, rest looked silent. But feeling Charlie shrank though touch painful him, Bliss unbared his back, two blue weals across showed done. "Look there, Kenrick," he said, great sternness, he pointed marks; then, laying Charlie gently his bed, he thundered out, voice shaken passion, "You _dogs_, could look allow this? By heavens, Kenrick, _you_ mean suffer this, I will not. Out way, you." Scattering rest like flock sheep, he seized Mackworth his strong hands, shook violently shoulders, tearing cane his grasp, he demanded, "Was this?" "What about, Bliss?" said Mackworth, ruffled dignity. "Mind you are after, do not make row, ass's head," he continued authoritatively, "or you will Noel one here." "Ho! that is tone, cruel, reprobate bully," said Bliss, supplied indignation unusual flow words; "we have enough that, much. You look poor little Evson there, sink earth shame! By heavens, Belial, shall receive you have given. I will beat dog. Take that." The cut followed showed he desperate earnest, that, however immovable he might generally be, means safe trifle mood this. Mackworth tried vain seize cane; Bliss turned round round he child; quite clear he mean done yet, Mackworth's impudent bravado changed abject terror he received second weighty stroke, heartily administered cane bent round him, hideous way canes have, caught blow ribs. Mackworth sprang away, fled, howling shame pain, open door, Bliss given two blows back, one two cutting open his coat collar downwards, leaving mark least black he inflicted defenceless Charlie. "To rooms, rest wretches," said he, dispersed every direction him. "Kenrick," he continued, brandishing cane, "I may dolt, you have called now, since will not duty, henceforth I you." Kenrick slank off, half afraid Bliss would apply cane _him_; and, speaking tone authority, Bliss said boys dormitory, "If one henceforth touch hair Evson's head, look out; know me. You little scamp scoundrel, Wilton, take especial care." He enforced admonition making Wilton jump little rap cane, he broke, flung window. And then, his whole manner changing instantly almost womanly tenderness, he sat poor little Charlie, soothing comforting till his hysterical sobs ceased; and, he felt sure fit over, gently bade good-night, went out, leaving room dense silence, one ventured break warm-hearted little Hanley, who, going Charlie's bedside, said-- "Oh, Charlie, hurt much?" "No, much, thank you, Hanley." Hanley pressed his hand, said, "You have conquered, Charlie; you have held end. Oh, I wish I like you!" CHAPTER THIRTY FOUR. A CONSPIRACY FOILED. As feathery snows Fall frequent wintry day... The stony volleys flew. Cowper. Yes, Charlie conquered, thanks grace sustained him, thanks, secondarily, good home training, Walter's strong excellent influence. And gaining one point he gained all. No one dared directly molest further, he never maintain hard struggle. He resisted beginnings evil; he held stress persecution; he could enjoy smoother brighter waters he sailed. His enemies time discomfited, even hardy Wilton abashed. For week two considerably less bravado his face manner, his influence his age shaken. That little rap cane Bliss given salutary effect diminishing his conceit. Hanley retracted his promise deny knowledge anything wrong went on, openly defied Wilton; even Elgood ceased fear him. Charlie felt inclined cut him, but, generous impulse, he forgave past, and, keeping civil terms him, he could draw less crooked paths. Mackworth ashamed he hardly ventured show his face. He always made Bliss laughing-stock, nicknamed Ass's Head, taught others jeer his backwardness. He presumed his lazy good humour, affected patronise look him. An eruption long-extinct volcano could surprised sudden outburst Bliss's wrath, two blows he received he fled sight whole house branded his back hot iron, could hardly caused painful humiliation. For time he slunk like whipped puppy, imagined, without ground, one saw without inclination smile. Kenrick, too, reason blush. Every one knew Bliss, he, rescued house attaching name another indelible disgrace; he heard monitors sixth-form talking seriously among bad state Noelites fallen, he felt stigma deserved, _he_, chief mischief, must wear brand. All Kenrick's faults errors root overweening pride, pride grew fast upon him, intensity increased proportion grew less less justifiable. But he suffered salutary rebuke. He openly blamed, openly slighted, openly set aside, unable gainsay justice proceeding. He felt every boy school, right feeling, Bliss regarded upright honourable-- nay, even important influential, person himself. Among mortifications, galled especially hear warm thanks cordial praise Power Walter Henderson expressed first happened meet Bliss. He saw Walter wring his hand, overheard saying genial tone he addressed often--"Thank you, Bliss, thousand times saving dear little brother hands brutes. Charlie I soon forget much owe you." Walter said tears his eyes, Bliss answered happy smile--"Do not thank me, Walter; I fellow would done worth anything." "And you will look Charlie then, you?" "That I will," said Bliss; "but need not fear him--he is hero, regular hero--that is I call him, I would anything him." So Kenrick, vexed discontented, almost hid days his study, victim wearing intolerable sickening diseases--a sense shame. Except play football occasionally, he seldom left his room took exercise, fell dispirited, broken way life, feeling unhappy alone. He associates except his inferiors, his conduct forfeited regard his equals, many he open feud. The pleasure left desperately hard work. Not he stimulated fiery ambition, mad desire excel half-year's competition, show he yet capable of, extent redeem his unhappy position, also his heart fixed getting, possible, chief scholarship Saint Winifred's--a scholarship sufficiently valuable pay main part college expenses would otherwise impossible his mother bear. He feared, indeed, he little chance Power, even Walter, competitors, he would give hope. His abilities brilliant order, he often idle Saint Winifred's, he had, hand, often worked exceedingly hard holidays Fuzby, where, unlike boys, he little nothing else amuse him. Mrs Kenrick, sitting beside silent her work long hours, would glad enough see elasticity, kindliness, less absorption his selfish pursuits; she rejoiced home, rate, he waste his vacant days idleness, spend questionable amusements undesirable society. Almost boy he saw much Wilton, him, I believe, days he would changed his whole tone thought mode life. But he strange liking worthless boy, kept alive his jealousy Walter, his opposition monitors, his partisanship, his recklessness, his pride. Sometimes Kenrick felt this. He saw Wilton bad well attractive, friendship, instead Wilton good, harm. But he could make his mind throw off, one else seemed feel close intimate friend. Many Kenrick's failings rose that. He offended, rejected, alienated his early true friends, he felt easier lose friends make them, recover affection lost. But bad set Saint Winifred's, though one house influence weakened, determined see wane throughout school. Harpour his associates organised regular conspiracy monitors. When first light snow fell got together large number fellows, snowballed monitors except Kenrick, came morning school. The exception much Kenrick's discredit, his heart he felt so. During first day two lasted monitors took good-humouredly, returning snowballs, regarding joke, though annoying one; became serious, snowballs thrown masters also, worst fellows began collect snowballs beforehand harden great lumps ice hard stones, Brown, short-sighted, therefore least able protect himself, received serious blow, Power, advice rest, put notice time snowballing must cease, monitors would punish boys it. This notice school tried resist, firmness Power his friends put stop rebellion. If notice disregarded he determined, Walter's, advice, seize ringleaders, notice younger boys incited. Accordingly next morning found school gathered usual, spite notice, purpose pelting them, and, saying nothing, kept eyes biggest fellows group. A shower snowballs fell among them, hitting several them, and, great amusement school, knocking several hats snow. "Harpour," said Walter, sternly, "I saw throw snowball. Are not ashamed you, fellow head eleven, set bad example? Do not suppose size position shall get off. Come monitors directly breakfast." "Hanged I do," answered Harpour, sulky laugh. "Well, I daresay _will_ hanged long-run," contemptuous reply; "but come, else take consequences." "Tracy," said Henderson, "I saw throw snowball knocked Power's hat. It hard one too. You come monitors Harpour." "I shall quaite delaighted," drawled Tracy. "Glad hear it; I hope you will quaite equally delaighted leave us." The mimicry perfect boys broke roar laughter, louder Tracy immediately began chafe "smoke." "And, Jones," said Power, laugh Tracy subsided, "I think I saw _you_ throw snowball hit Smythe. I strongly suspect, too, fellow hit Brown yesterday. I think every one know, Jones, chose Smythe Brown pelt, instead monitors. You come sixth-form room breakfast." "I did not throw one," said Jones. "You astounding liar," said Henderson, "I saw eyes." "Oh, ay; course you will say spite me." "_Spite_ you," said Henderson scornfully; "my dear fellow, do not enter thoughts all. But mark you, Master Jones, I know moreover you have chief getter-up precious demonstration. You told fellows you would lead them. I am sure did not quote lines-- "`Press ye see _white plume_ shine amid ranks war, And oriflamme to-day helmet of--Jones.'" Another peal laughter followed allusion Jones's well-known nickname White-feather, nickname earned many acts conspicuous cowardice. "Hush, Flip," whispered Power, "we must not make quite joke. Jones," he continued aloud, "do deny throwing snowball Smythe?" "I did not throw one," said Jones, turning pale he heard hiss, murmur "White-feather again," followed his denial. "Why, pitiful, wretched, sneaking coward are," burst Franklin; "I heard egging fellows pelt monitors-- would not done Harpour--and I saw hit Smythe now. You took care pelt one else, deny us saw you. Upon word, Jones, I feel inclined kick you, I too." "Stop, Franklin," said Walter, laying his hands his shoulder, "leave us now. Do still deny throwing, Jones?" "Well, little piece snow," said Jones, showing his blotched face every contemptible passion fused one feeling abject fear. "Faugh!" said Power, scorn disgust curling his lip burning his glance; "really, Jones, you are almost mean nasty dealings with. I do not think honour convening you. You shall apologise Smythe now, shall enough _you_." "What! hesitate?" said Franklin; "you do not know you are well off. Be quick, want breakfast." "Never mind making apologise," said Smythe; "he is sunk quite low enough already." "It is his doing," said Walter. "We cannot lies like his told without blush Saint Winifred's. Apologise he must shall." "Do not it," said Mackworth. "What!" said Henderson, "is Mackworth speaking? Ah! I thought so--Bliss is not here!" Henderson's manner irresistibly comic; Mackworth winced slunk back outside crowd, loud laugh followed showed complete exposure worthlessness champions already turned current feeling among young conspirators, beginning regret unprovoked attack upper boys. "Now then, Jones, read," said Walter, writing slip paper--"I humbly beg Smythe's pardon pelting him, pardon present abominable lies." Jones began mumble out, arose general shout of-- "On knees, White-feather; knees, much louder." Franklin, boiling anger contempt, sprang forward, took Jones neck, forced his knees snow, he made read apology, let loose. A shower snowballs followed he ran refuge breakfast-hall, boy present, matter faction he belonged, feel Jones hearty contempt. "I hope shall this, boys," said Power, rest dispersed. "There monitors Saint Winifred's hundred years now, it is infinitely better school be. I suppose would hardly prefer mercy fellow that," he said, pointing direction Jones's flight. "I do not know unpopular amongst you. You know one us ever abused his authority, behaved otherwise kindly all. But I sorry see set on--set fellows ought know better. Do not suppose, you, frighten us know right, _you_ intimidate us acting good school." They cheered his simple words, proud head-monitor. They never Saint Winifred's better scholar, honourable boy; though Harpour his friends affected sneer him, Power general favourite, firm attitude he assumed increased respect admiration he always inspired. "No notice taken this, little fellows," said Walter crowd smaller boys; "we know well merely tools hands, singled three fellows. I quite sure will not behave way again; do, remember shall not pass lightly." "Come you, Wilton," said Henderson, rest dispersing. "You have particularly busy, I see. So! six good hard snowballs jacket pocket, eh? Now, employ collecting every one snowballs lying ready here, throw pond. Do not let see _one_ I come out. Belial junior curtail his breakfast-time morning, I guess," he continued Whalley; "the young villain! shall ever bring right mind?" Wilton, diabolical frame mind, began his appointed task, finished boys came breakfast. "That do," said Henderson. "I must trouble one minute more. Come me." Shaking cold alarm, Wilton obeyed, muttering threats vengeance, driven almost frantic laughter Henderson received them. He walked across sixth-form room, seeing monitors assembled, sent "to tell his friends, Harpour Tracy, presence demanded immediately." "Never mind, Raven," said Kenrick him; "it is shame bully you." "I made collect snowballs he chief hand making, one yesterday monitor seriously hurt; I sent message two worthless fellows, whose counsels he generally follows; things I done teach mild salutary lesson. Is call bullying?" "I believe spite boy know I like him. It is kind conduct worthy you." "If gives comfort say so, Kenrick, pray do; let tell you, way allowed young Evson others treated house, charge bullying comes singularly ill grace you." An angry retort sprang Kenrick's lips; moment two offenders came door, Power said, "Hush, two. We need unity now, ever, harmful fellows find quarrel going Kenrick, I wish would try to--" "Oh; yes; it is always Kenrick, course," said he angrily. "I will nothing proceedings;" and, rising, his place, he flung room, sorry absent scene he thought might compromise his popularity excepted list monitors, professed consider natural enemies. Harpour Tracy thought convened monitors would opportunity displaying plenty insolence indifference; found standing presence fifteen upper boys, one respects superior, courage evaporated. But let easily. The monitors content complete triumph gained morning, disgrace fellows compelled submit. All required expression regret done, promise offend way again; extorted, dismissed Power good advice, tolerably stern reprimand. Power ease force moved admiration his brother monitors; one could done he it, supported authority high stainless character consistently maintained. What he said without effect; even coarse burly Harpour dared look up, could fix his eyes floor kick matting sullen wrath virtuous noble boy looked rebuked him; Tracy deeply moved. Tracy, weak, foolish, feebly fast he was, elements good gentlemanly feeling him, and, wisely chosen associates, would developed much less contemptible character. When Power done speaking, he looked said, without one particle his usual affectation-- "I really sorry helping get affair. I see I have wrong, I beg pardon sincerely. You may depend anything thing kind." "Thank you, Tracy," said Walter; "that spoken like man. We have known time now, I wish could get unitedly. You might good school chose." "Not much, I am afraid now," said Tracy, "but I will tr(ai)y." "Well, then, Tracy, we will shake hands resolve, bygones shall bygones," said Henderson. "You will forgive making fun morning." He shook hands Henderson Walter, Power, holding his hand, said, smiling, "It is never late mend." "No," said Tracy, looking one his boots, he habit putting other. "He applied remark his boots, Power," said Henderson, laughing. "Did observe hole one distressed him." So monitors separated, without hopes things beginning look little brighter before. CHAPTER THIRTY FIVE. THE FINAL FRACAS. Harpour, who, like him, long endeavouring undermine authority safeguard morality school, felt distinctly baffled. Mackworth put utter rout Bliss, though he almost bursting dark spite, would venture much; Jones become perfect joke whole school, constantly white hen's feathers goose-feathers enclosed little envelopes he half mad impotent wrath; Harpour made decidedly swallow leek public humiliation; Wilton, he began feel rather small. Tracy openly deserted them. After interview Power, Harpour abused roundly turncoat, he told his former associates he sorry anything machinations; going wrong, ruining school, he rate felt he done mischief enough already, meant more. This proof failing influence exasperated greatly. Harpour threatened, Mackworth said pungent insulting things he could, contemptuously mimicking Tracy's dandiacal affectations. Tracy winced treatment; high words followed, scene noisy altercation, Tracy broke his former "party," quarrel spoke more. Dr Lane, too, recovered his fever, returned school. When reins his strong hands, difference soon perceived. The abuses crept his absence quietly firmly rectified, tendencies insubordination repressed stern decision impossible gainsay resist. The whole aspect things altered, and, lonely he among Noelites, even Charlie Evson began like Saint Winifred's better, feel home precincts. Still, rebelliously inclined determined give once, anxiously looked opportunity could Kenrick side. If could secure this, felt tolerably confident giving monitors rebuff, carrying numerous body school taught training resist authority every possible occasion. The opportunity long wanting. One fine afternoon poor old woman come playground basket trifles, sale she hoped support herself unexpectedly long absence sailor son. Her extreme neatness person, her quiet, respectable manners interested boys her appearance; she came sell little articles, many her industry made, she generally found ready purchasers. Walter, knew her well, visited her cottage, often seen sailor boy whose earnings she great measure depended. This son away time distant voyage, poor woman, pressed necessaries life, took her basket playground Saint Winifred's. Charlie often heard her Walter, he gladly made her small purchases, boys followed his example. While he this, he distinctly saw one Noelites--an ill-conditioned fellow she will, named Penn--thrust his hand old woman's basket, surrounded large group boys, secrete small bottle scent. Charlie waited moment, expecting see pay it, Penn, fancied he unobserved, dropped quietly his pocket, stood looking innocent indifferent air. Instantly Charlie's indignation knew bounds. He could hardly believe his eyes; he knew worst school, his house particular, would regard venial offence. They would call stealing "bagging thing," or, worst, "cribbing it"--concealing villainy new name, name odious associations attached it; called lying "cramming," title sounded much less repulsive. In fact, young Noelites took Spartan view petty larcenies, confining criminality incurring detection. But never succeeded making Charlie take view; he never would adopt change language altered accepted meaning words accordance propensities dispositions, particular act Penn committed perfect nonchalance, appeared theft, theft accompanied cruelty deadness sense pity, dipped blackest revolting dye. He could restrain, attempt restrain, passionate contempt horror he felt act. "Penn," he said, loud excited voice, doubting sympathies others would warm his own, "Penn, wicked brute, stolen bottle scent. Here, Mrs Hart, _you_ shall not suffer rate _is_ fellow base wicked," he pulled his last half-crown, insisted her taking payment stolen article. Penn, moment, quite taken aback scathing flame Charlie's righteous anger. If none Noelites he would made light accusation, probably laughed off; others looking would, he knew, view transaction different light, he thought his safest course lay flat denial. It reasonable expect he would stick this; boy scruples "bagging" property poverty-stricken old woman, likely hesitate telling "cram" escape exposure. "What is about, little fool? I have not bagged anything." Charlie still amazed; he positively could understand great brazen lie like this, yet impossible doubt _was_ lie, evidence his senses. "You did not take scent-bottle? oh! _can_ tell lie? I saw eyes." "What I care eyes?" answer Penn vouchsafed return. "You are always flying fellows like young turkey-cock, No-thank-you," said Wilton. "Why do not thrash him, Penn, his confounded impudence?" "Thrash like, Raven; I do not care snap finger he says." "What mean, No-thank-you, charging bagging thing he says he did not?" said Wilton threatening tone Charlie; Charlie took notice, he enforced question slap cheek; Wilton old grudges Charlie pay off. "I did not speak _you_, Wilton; shall not hit nothing; force fight will," said Charlie, returning blow; "you cannot say I am get anything time, before." A long desperate fight ensued Charlie Wilton; long desperate opinion several bystanders; one near authority, nobody liked interfere. So, equally matched, neither combatants showed least sign giving in, though faces clothes smeared blood. At last Henderson Whalley, strolling playground, caught sight crowd, came see matter. "It is fight," said Henderson; "young Evson Belial junior; I would much rather see fight see friends." "Yes, Flip; they have evidently fighting quite long enough good them. You are monitor--could not see ought separated, shake hands?" "Hallo, stop, two," said Henderson, pushing his way crowd. "What is about? let us see it is right." "It is fair fight," said several; "you have right stop it." "I will not stop unless there is good reason, though I think it is gone long enough. What began it?" "No-thank-you charged Penn with--" "Who No-thank-you?" asked Whalley. "Young Evson, then," said Mackworth sulkily, "charged Penn bagging scent-bottle old woman's basket, he impudent, Wilton going pitch him." "And could not manage it, apparently," said Whalley; "come, two, shake hands now." Charlie, moment's hesitation, frankly held his hand; Wilton said, "He would right accuse Noelite falsely he did." "It was not falsely," said Charlie; "I saw take it, horrid shame was." "Is one bottles missing, Mrs Hart?" asked Whalley. "Yes, sir; young Master Evson paid it, I do not want fighting it, sir, please." "Well, good woman, there is something you," said Henderson, giving her shilling; "and I hope nobody treat badly again; you would better go now. And now, Penn, did not take bottle, course will not mind searched?" "Of course I _shall_," said Penn, edging uneasily away try possible get rid unlucky bottle, felt burned his pocket. "Stay, friend," said Whalley, collaring him; "no shuffling away, please." "What devil right search me?" said Penn, struggling vain Whalley's grasp; "do not fellows let search me." The attention fairly diverted fight, which, therefore, remained undecided; boys, especially Noelites, formed angry group round Henderson Whalley, prevent them, possible, attempt search Penn. Meanwhile, seeing something going on, boys came flocking large number school assembled there, Whalley still kept tight hold Penn, Henderson watched he play tricks; Noelites meantime exclaiming loudly supposed infringement abstract rights. Kenrick one come up; several fellows entreated stick his house, let Penn searched, he worked passion, pushing circle, said loudly, "You have right search him; shall not it." "Here is head school, he shall decide," said Henderson, Power Walter approached. "State case, Kenrick." "Well, case simply is, scent-bottle taken Mrs Hart; Penn does not see--nor I--why he searched." "You have not mentioned young Evson says he _saw_ take it." "Why, Charlie, _have_ doing?" said Walter, looking his brother's bruised smeared face surprise. "Only fight," said Charlie; "I could not help it, Walter; Wilton struck I charged Penn taking bottle." "Are absolutely certain saw him, Charlie?" "Yes; I could not possibly mistaken." "Well, then, clearly Penn must searched," said Walter. "But stop," said Power; "are not beginning wrong end? Penn, doubt, ask quietly, empty his pockets satisfaction?" "No I will not," said Penn, dogged sullen. "Well, Kenrick taken part, let search privately?" "No!" "Then search him, Henderson." Instantly rapid movement took place among boys though prevent this; anything could done, Henderson seized Penn wrists Whalley, diving hand his right pocket, drew held little ornamental scent-bottle! This decisive proof produced moment dead silence among loud voices raised altercation; Power said-- "Penn, convicted lying theft. What Saint Winifred's coming too, fellows act like this? How I punish him?" he asked, turning monitors. "Here now, red-handed, _flagrante delicto_," said Walter. "Some lower fellows need example." "I think right. Symes, fetch cane." "You shall not touch him," said Kenrick; "you would right search him, first place." "I mean cane him, Kenrick. Who prevent me?" "We will," said several voices; among Harpour's Mackworth's prominent. "You mean try prevent force?" "Yes." "And, Kenrick, abet this?" "I do," said Kenrick, lost self-control. "I shall it, nevertheless; plain duty." "And I recommend interfere," said Walter; "for must shall done." "Harpour," said Franklin, "remember, try force, I one moment stir." "And I," said Bliss, stepping front Power; "and I," said Eden, Cradock, Anthony, others--among Tracy--taking places monitors, forming firm front together. Symes brought cane. Power took it, another monitor held Penn firmly wrists. At first stroke, biggest fifth-form fellows made rush forward, flung back, could break line, Harpour measured his full length turf effects buffet Franklin dealt him. Kenrick among pressed forward; then, his surprise shame, Walter, stronger two, grasped shoulder, held back, said low tone, firm yet kind, "You must excuse this, Kenrick; otherwise might suffer it, I think thank afterwards." Kenrick astonished, he desisted. Those first words Walter spoken him, time Walter touched him, nearly three years; spite abuse, calumny, opposition Walter encountered his hands, Kenrick could feel wise words, prompted, like action itself, spirit true kindness. He said nothing, abruptly turned away left ground. The struggle lasted moment, thoroughly repulsed. There could least doubt that, fact side righteous order outnumbered exceeded strength turbulent malcontents. Power inflicted Penn severe caning then. The attempt prevent this, audacious unparalleled was, afforded complete failure yet another proof things coming round, efforts monitors improve tone lower boys would tell greater greater force. Even character Noelites beginning improve; bad house single little new boy successfully braved organised antagonism good, his victorious virtuous courage brought others side right, triumphing, mere force good principle, banded multitude boys far older, abler, stronger himself. So Harpour, Mackworth, Jones, confined society, forced keep misconduct themselves. They sullenly admitted foiled thwarted, time forward left school recover fast could vicious influence. Among consolations--for found shunned sides--they proposed go supper Dan's. One day, events last narrated, Power seen go there. He sent once, told must know strictly forbidden, wretch Dan was, ruinous visits his cottage must be. They knew well he informed would instantly expelled, entreated serious earnestness pass time, notion monitor would ever tell them, _because since he monitor, Kenrick accompanied there_. Shocked he hear this, determined Power report them, condition, he made known monitors, he specially pointedly gave warning Kenrick, would offend again. This promise wilfully broke, feeling perfectly secure, Dan's cottage remote lonely part shore, boys ever walked, little chance seen, took precaution entering back gate. But within week Penn's thrashing, Walter strolling near cottage Eden Charlie, climbed cliff little way pluck Eden (who taken botany) flower yellow horned poppy waving there, he saw go Dan's door, them--as he felt sure--little Wilton. The moment, however, he caught sight them, fourth boy, seeing cliff, taken vigorously his heels scrambled away behind rocks. Walter neither wish power overtake him, he much _seen_ Wilton inferred tolerable certainty he, he reported Harpour, Mackworth, Jones Dr Lane; time sending Wilton tell his suspicion, give severe earnest warning. Dr Lane, best possible grounds, repeatedly announced he would expel boy dealings scoundrel Dan. He likely swerve declaration case, still less sake boys whose school career dishonourable reprobate three offenders. They three publicly expelled without mercy without delay; departed, carrying them, well-deserved do, contempt almost execration great majority school. In course examination headmaster, Jones, meanness malice thoroughly characteristic, said, "that he know harm going Dan's, Kenrick, one monitors, done thing." At time, Dr Lane contemptuously silenced him, remark, "that he would gain nothing turning informer;" Dr Lane always kept pretty well informed went Famulus, he reason suspect, even know, Jones said instance true. He knew, too, quarters unsatisfactorily Kenrick going on, part he taken several acts insubordination disobedience. Accordingly, sooner Harpour, Jones, Mackworth banished Saint Winifred's, he sent Kenrick, administered reprimand uncompromising stern, Kenrick never forgot end his life. After upbraiding many inconsistencies follies, forfeited strong esteem regard he felt him, he pointed finally he wasting his school-life, little his knowledge ability could redeem his neglect duty betrayal trust; he ended saying, "All reasons, Kenrick, made seriously doubt whether I degrade altogether position monitor head house. It would strong step, stronger deserve. I alone prevented deep sincere wish yet recover fall; that, knowing slight trust still reposed you, may something prove worthy trust, regain confidence. I content myself, therefore, putting present place _lowest_ list monitors--a public mark displeasure, I sure feel just; I must also remove headship house--a post I grieve know grievously misused. I shall put Whalley place, happens monitor conveniently spared. He, therefore, head Mr Noel's house; and, far, amenable his authority, which, I hope, attempt resist." Kenrick, full bitter thoughts, hung his head, said nothing. To know Dr Lane love respect him; poor fatherless boy _did_ feel great pain incurred his anger. "I unwilling, Kenrick," continued Doctor, "to dismiss without adding one word kindness. You know, dear boy, I welfare closely heart, I felt warm personal regard; I trust I may yet able bestow upon again. Go use time better; remember monitor; remember well-being many others depends slight measure conscientious discharge duties; check career leads fast ruin; thank God, Kenrick, actually expelled three boys been, still time opportunity amend, win character had." Turned his headship give way fifth-form boy, turned bottom monitors, poor Kenrick felt unspeakably degraded; he forced endure yet bitter mortification. Before going Dr Lane he received message he wanted sixth-form room, and, touch his old pride, answered, "Tell I will not come." Hardly he reached his study leaving Doctor, Henderson entered grave face, saying, "I sorry, Kenrick, bearer this," handed folded sheet paper. Opening he found that, monitors' meeting, he summoned, unanimous vote censure passed upon his absence, opposition he always displayed his colleagues, disgraceful part he taken attempting coerce force case Penn. The document concluded, "We therefore obliged, though great real reluctance, take unusual step recording monitors' book vote censure Kenrick, fourth monitor, bad example he set great harm he done, betraying interests violating first conditions he received his authority: this, spirit anger, solely earnest affectionate hope unanimous condemnation his conduct his coadjutors may serve recall sense his duty." Appended names monitors--but, no; he glanced names he saw one absent, name Walter Evson. Evidently, Walter _disapproved_ measure, for, case, Kenrick knew his name would appeared end formal dissentient; no, omission his name due, Kenrick saw, high reserve, delicate, courteous consideration marked whole Walter's behaviour since day disastrous quarrel. Kenrick appreciated delicacy, his eyes suffused tears. Wilton, somewhat cowed recent occurrences, boy his study time, though Kenrick would glad one near him, he could talk disgraces fallen heavily upon him, he could look little sympathy counsel, yet Wilton he felt inclination communicative. There was, indeed, something Wilton he could help liking, could sort equality them. "Ken," said Wilton, "do remember telling day I shedding crocodile tears?--what crocodile tears? I have always wanting ask you." "It is phrase, Ra, sham tears; rude me, was not it? Herodotus says something crocodiles; perhaps he will explain us. I would look see I Herodotus here, I lost nearly three years ago." By one curious coincidences, look strange books, happen daily common life, Tracy moment entered lost Herodotus his hand, saying-- "Kenrick, I happened hunting classroom cupboard book I would mislaid, I found book name it--an Herodotus; I thought I would bring you." "By Jove!" said Wilton, "talk of--" "Herodotus, he will appear," said Kenrick; "how odd. It is mine, sure enough! I lost it, I telling Wilton, I do not know long ago. Now, Raven, I will find he says crocodiles." "Before look, may I tell something?" asked Tracy. "I wanted opportunity speak you." "Well?" "Do mind coming court, then?" said Tracy, glancing Wilton. "Oh, never mind me," said Wilton; "I will go out." "I shall not minute," said Tracy, "and come back. What I wanted say, Kenrick, this, great shame tell before; I see I have poor tool hands fellows. Jones made believe, know, _that Evson told him_ home affairs, pony-chaise, on," said Tracy, hurrying obnoxious subject. "Yes, yes," said Kenrick impatiently. "Well, he never did, know. I have heard Jones confess often his lips." "How I believe one lie another, then? I believe fellow could not open his lips without lie flying them. How could Jones possibly known way? There one fellow could told him, Evson. Evson _must_ told lie he said he would mentioned one Power." "I do not believe Evson ever told lie his life," said Tracy. "However, I explain difficulty. Jones train Evson; he saw ride home; and, staying Littleton, next town live, he heard there. I have heard say so." "The black-hearted brute!" Kenrick could ejaculate, he paced his study agitated steps. "O Tracy, utter, utter ass, fool, wretch, I have been." "So I," said Tracy; "but I am sorry now, hope improve. Better late never. Good morning, Kenrick." When Wilton returned study quarter hour after, he found Kenrick's attention riveted note he held his hand, he seemed reading his whole soul. So absorbed he he even disturbed Wilton's entrance. Listlessly turning pages his Herodotus divert his painful thoughts looking passage crocodiles, Kenrick found old note directed himself. Painful thoughts, seems, give respite day; well he knew handwriting, altered little now, firm mature, even good, though boyish hand. He tore open; dated three years back, signed Walter Evson. It long lost note Walter, twice rebuffed, frankly even earnestly asked pardon supposed fault, begged immediate reconciliation--the note Walter course imagined Kenrick received, his taking notice it, inferred, hope renewing friendship finally end. Kenrick could help thinking different great part his school-life would been, note come hand! He saw clearly possible--his haste, his rash false inferences, his foolish jealousy, his impetuous pride, his quick degeneracy, mischief he caused, folly he done, time he wasted. Disgraced, degraded, despised best fellows school, censured unanimously his colleagues, given masters he respected, without single true friend, grievously hopelessly wrong commencement, he felt _bowed conquered_, and, Wilton's amazement, he laid his head upon his arms table without saying word, broke heavy sob. If his conscience declared him, he could borne everything else; conscience enemy, chance mind ease. Kenrick sat miserable self-condemned; he injured his friend, injured his fellows, injured, deeply all, himself. For, poet sings-- "He wrongs his friend, Wrongs more; ever bears A silent court justice his breast; Himself judge jury, The prisoner bar, ever condemned. And drags his life." CHAPTER THIRTY SIX. IN THE DEPTHS. How easy keep free sin, How hard freedom recall! For dreadful truth is, men _Forget_ heavens fall. Cov. Patmore. It may thought strange Kenrick once, his heart softened, he saw clearly much he erred, go Walter, confess everything explained, he never received his last note, that, his sake, he desired restored, far possible, his former footing. If Kenrick period depression ill-repute, he would undoubtedly done so; he like go, he disgrace, his friendship could credit, and, he feared, confer pleasure one, circumstances would make appear he changed his views influence selfish interest, rather true conviction generous impulse. He thought, too, friendship like water spilt, could gathered again; like broken thread cannot smoothly reunited. So things remained footing before, except Kenrick's whole demeanour changed better. He bore his punishment quiet manly way; took his place without murmur Henderson bottom monitors; bravado attempt conceal he felt justly humiliated, gave Whalley his best assistance governing Noelites, bringing back slow sure degrees better tone thought feeling. Towards Walter especially his whole manner altered. Hitherto he made point always opposing him, taking every opportunity show strong dislike. If Walter embraced one opinion monitors' meeting, quite sufficient reason Kenrick support another; Walter spoken one side debating society, Kenrick held logical consequence that, whatever he thought, he speak other, use his powers speaking, considerable, throw Walter's illustrations arguments ridicule he could. All folly virulence abandoned; swagger Kenrick adopted time entirely laid aside. At next meeting debating society he spoke, indeed he generally thought, side Walter; spoke, his usual flippant conceited style, seriously earnestly, treating Walter's speech approval almost deference. Every one noticed rejoiced change manner, none Walter Evson Power. Kenrick finished words--"Gentlemen, I sit I task perform, which, however painful may me, due I neglect. I may now, I see none sixth-form present, I may another early opportunity. I incurred, well aware, unanimous vote censure colleagues--unanimous, although, delicacy I thankful still capable keenly appreciating, name one..." word "friend" sprang his lips, humility forbade adopt it, he said... "the name one monitor absent appended signatures. Gentlemen, I like public recantations public professions, I feel duty acknowledge without palliation I feel censure deserved." His voice faltered emotion he proceeded: "I misled, gentlemen, I labouring long time grievous mistake, led much injustice inflict many wrongs; errors I ask pardon all, especially concerned. Your censure, gentlemen, concluded kind friendly wish, I cannot trust say now, echo wish heart, hope ere long efforts I shall endeavour make may succeed persuading give back confidence esteem, erase book permanent record recent disapproval." Every one present felt great must suffering could wring expression regret nature proud Kenrick's. They listened silence, he sat greeted applause showed readily he might win regard; many came round shook hands warmth. "Gentlemen," said Power, rising, "I sure feel remarks heard honour speaker. I hold hand monitors' book, open page censure written. After heard necessity page remain single day. I beg move leave may given tear once." "And I eager second motion," said Henderson, starting moment several others; "and, Kenrick--if I may break through, occasion this, ordinary forms, address name--I sure believe though I often opposed you, one glad welcome back friend, hope may soon be, capable being, greatest support, also one brightest ornaments body." He held his hand, Kenrick readily grasped, whispering, sigh, "Ah, Flip, I wish never broken other!" The proposal carried acclamation, Power accordingly tore sheet put fire. And night brightened Kenrick dawn better days. Twenty times Walter thought Kenrick going speak him--for his manner quite different; Kenrick, though every particle ill-will vanished his mind, replaced his old unimpaired affection, put reconciliation he able measure recover his old position, meet his friend footing greater equality. Do let one think his reformation easy. It took long conquer himself, he found task sorely difficult; many failures relapses, words another sinned suffered three thousand years ago, who, many struggle, discovered true secret, came home Kenrick whispered message--"Then I said, _It mine infirmity: I remember years right-hand Most Highest_." It long one great difficulty confronted him, consequence former misdeeds, put circumstances demanded whole courage his character, thoroughly tested sincerity his repentance. After Mackworth's expulsion, Whalley's good government, state Noelites greatly improved. Charlie Evson, whom, now, by, Kenrick always everything lay his power, became far model among younger boys Wilton ever been, final end suppers, smoking parties, organised cribbing, recognised "crams." But house recovering lost ground, ceased quite byeword school, thrown consternation long-continued series petty thefts. Small sums extracted boys' jacket pockets gone bed; play-boxes provided good locks keys; private desks classrooms, dormitories, several studies. There clue offender, first suspicion fell strongly new boy, little Elgood. A trifling items circumstantial evidence seemed point out, began gradually whispered, one exactly knew whom, he must guilty boy. Hints thrown effect; little bits paper, written words "Thou shalt steal," "The devil thieves," dropped his books wherever he likely find them, whenever subject brought tapis his manner closely watched. The effect unsatisfactory; Elgood timid nervous boy, uneasiness nervousness gave rise set sign guilt. At length sovereign half stolen Whalley's study, Elgood, Whalley's fag, constant access study, might well known Whalley money, place he kept it, prevalent suspicions confirmed. The boys, usual thoughtless haste, leapt conclusion he must thief. The house perfect ferment. However lightly one two them, like Penn, may thought taking trifles small tradesmen, single one among them, even Penn himself, whose morality brand thieving schoolfellows wicked mean. The boys felt, too, stigma house, unhappily Just time majority really anxious raise corporate reputation. Every one filled annoyance disgust, felt anxious determination discover give thief. At last suspicions Elgood proceeded far, mere justice heads house, Whalley, Kenrick, Bliss, thought right he questioned. So, tea, house assembled classroom, Elgood formally charged delinquency, questioned it, Wilton, particular, urging almost bullying tone surrender confess. The poor child overwhelmed terror--cried, blushed, answered incoherently, lost his head, would moment confess he done it, protested his innocence many sobs tears. "Well, I suppose he persists denying it, cannot go further," said Kenrick; "but I am afraid, Elgood, must something it, every one seems see ground suspecting you." "Oh, I had not, I had not; indeed I had not," wailed Elgood; "I wish would not say so, Kenrick; indeed I am innocent, I would rather write home money ten times suspected." "So would one, little fool," said Wilton. "Do not bully way, Wilton," said Whalley; "it is way get truth him. Elgood, I thought innocent, did not behave oddly." "May I speak?" modestly asked new voice. The speaker Charlie Evson. "Yes, certainly," said Kenrick, encouraging tone. "Well then, please, Kenrick, whole you, I think _have_ truth him; I think he _is_ innocent." "Why, Charlie?" said Whalley; "what makes think so?" "Because I have asked him, talked privately it," said Charlie; "when frighten he gets confused, contradicts himself, he explain whatever looks suspicious ask kindly Quietly." "Bosh!" said Wilton; "who frightened him?" "Silence, Wilton," said Whalley. "Well, Charlie, question us?" "That I will," said Charlie, advancing putting his hand kindly round Elgood's shoulder, he seated desk Elgood standing. "Will tell us, I ask you, told morning?" "Yes," said Elgood eagerly, his whole manner changed nervous tremor perfect simplicity quiet new he friend stand him. "Well, now, money you have spending lately?" questioned Charlie, smile. "You usen't flush cash, know, month ago." "I tell you," answered Elgood; "I large present--large me, I mean--three weeks ago. My father sent pound, birthday, big brother aunt sent pound too." "I answer perfectly true," said Charlie, "for I went brother post-office afternoon asked, found Elgood three money-orders changed there. And now, Elgood, trust purse?" "Of course I can, Charlie," said Elgood, readily producing it, almost forgetting others present. "Ah, well, see _I'm_ going rifle it. Ah! here? why, here is whole sovereign, eight shillings; looks suspicious, does not it?" said Charlie archly. "No," said Elgood, laughing; "you went I bought desk eighteen shillings, rest--" "All right," said Charlie. "Look, fellows: Elgood I put morning things he is bought, come fourteen shillings. I know they are right, I did not like Elgood wrongly suspected, Walter want shops; indeed chiefly spent Coles's"--at remark laughed, Coles's favourite "tuck shop" boys. "Well, now, 1 pound, 8 shillings plus 18 shillings plus 14 shillings makes 3 pounds, sum Elgood received home. Is plain?" "As plain pike-staff," said Bliss; "and you are little brick, Evson; it is chouse one suspects Elgood more." Wilton suggested something Elgood Whalley's fag. "Shame, Raven," said Kenrick; "why, suspicious fellow must be; there is ground whatever suspect Elgood now." "I want fellow found honour house," said Wilton, sheepish look third rebuff. "Oh, I forgot moment," said Charlie; "Whalley, please, know time, do not you, money taken desk?" "Yes; must four six, I saw safe four, gone I came back tea." "Then right," said Charlie joyfully, "for time, it, Elgood brother's study me, learning lessons. Now then, Elgood clear?" "As clear noonday," shouted several them, patting poor child head. "And really, Charlie, we are much obliged you," said Whalley, "for setting matter straight. But now, _isn't_ Elgood, _is_ thief? We must set discover." "And _shall_ discover," said Bliss; "he is probably now. Who it?" he asked, glancing round. "Well, whoever is, I do not envy his sensations minute." The meeting broke up, Kenrick accompanied Whalley his study concert measures. "Have suspicion it, Whalley?" "Not least. Have you? No. Well, then, shall do?" "Why thief is not likely visit _your_ study again, Whalley; likely he will come mine. Suppose put little marked money secret drawer. It is rather joke call _secret_ drawer, there is secret it; anyhow, it is open secret." "Very good; then?" "Why, know money generally goes one particular time half-holidays. I am afraid rogue, whoever he is, got taste time, come money like fly jam-pot. Now, outside room, yards off, shoe-cupboard; I, others, agree shut turns, then, half-holidays roll-call tea-time?" "I see," said Whalley; "well, it is horribly unpleasant, I will take turn first. Is not door usually locked, though?" "Yes, much better; easily get left open, thief will not suspect ambuscade. He _must_ found out, sake boys innocent wipe blot house." "All right; I will ensconce to-morrow. I say, Ken, is not young Evson capital fellow? well he managed clear Elgood, did not he? I declare he taught us lesson." "Yes," said Kenrick; "he is his brother over; Walter he came." "What, _you_ say that?" said Whalley, smiling arching his eyebrows. "Indeed I do," said Kenrick, sadness; "I have not always thought so, more's pity;" he left room sigh. After his turn incarceration shoe-cupboard, Bliss complained loudly was not large enough accommodate him, cramped his long arms legs, say nothing unpleasant vicinity spiders earwigs. But others, laughing him, told that, experiment use whatever, must persevere it, Bliss allowed made victim. For time nothing happened, wait long. One day, Kenrick mounting guard half hour, getting tired, light hasty step passed along passage, his room. The boy found study empty, proceeded noiselessly open Kenrick's desk, examine contents. At length he pulled open secret drawer; opened little click, _there_ lay two half-sovereigns silver. He wary fellow, he scrutinised carefully see marked, finding mark kind them--for almost required microscope see tiny scratch w.w. smooth edge neck--he took his purse, proceeding drop it, _a heavy hand laid upon his shoulder_, Kenrick Wilton--the detected thief--stood face face. The purse dropped floor. For moment stood silent, staring other, drawing quick breaths. Wilton stood pale death, looked Kenrick trembling, frightened stare. It awful suddenly surprised; unknown eye-witness standing that, fancying unseen, he act committing secret deed sin; arrested, detected, exposed, boy whose hidden misdoings been, long, source discomfort, anxiety, shame. "_You_, Wilton--_you, you, you_, disturber house, _you_, long treated friend, allowed times use study; _you_, foremost throw suspicion others!" He stopped, breathless, his indignation rushing deep strong torrent find vent words. "O Kenrick, do not tell me." "Do not _tell_ you! Good heavens! find say? Not one word sorrow--not one word shame. Abandoned, heartless, graceless fellow!" "I driven it, Kenrick, indeed I was. I owed money Dan, to--to places, threatened tell I did not pay. Then Harpour fellows quite cleared cards; I believe cheating. O, do not tell me." "I cannot screen thief," freezing reply; change flame ice showed commotion his feelings thrown. "Well, then, comes that," said Wilton, turning sullen, "_I'll_ tell _you_. It will come out; remember first took Dan's, that is thing I could tell you. O Kenrick, do not tell, get us trouble." "This, then, creature I suffered call friend!" said Kenrick; "for I given best friends school! And gratitude! Why, worm, Wilton, take for? Do think fear _your_ disclosures make hush twenty thefts? You enlist whole strength conscience you, lest I seem screen sake. Faugh! touch sickens me!--go!" "O Kenrick, do not angry; I did not mean say it; I did not know I saying; I driven corner shame misery. I know I mean dog; even tell me, do not crush anger, indeed, indeed, I _have_ grateful, loved you, Kenrick. But oh, do not tell, I implore, I entreat you, Ken. How little I thought I speak like this!" But Kenrick could say--"_You_ thief; _you_, _last_ fellow I suspected; _you_ I called friend, O heavens! Yes, I know I have done harm bad example, I know I have much answer rate I never taught thief." "But one thing comes another, Ken; came much brutes, going Dan's; came that. I should not thought I could half bad things I _have_ done, two months ago. It came that; used go fellows, Ken, went Dan's;" boy wrung his hands, wept, flung his knees. "I must tell all, tell _me_." "Say again," said Kenrick, spurning scornfully away, "say again, I go straight Dr Lane. Poor worm, do not understand me, do not seem capability high thought you. I tell nothing say shall shake purpose. I going now." But he could get his straw hat Wilton clasped knees, voice agony beseeching relent. "It is true, Kenrick; I base, I know it; I quenched honour me. I will not say again, do, God's sake, forgive once, tell me. O Kenrick, _you_ never say forgive? Do, do, pity me, hope forgiven; do not ruin me, give bad name; I young, young, fallen bad hands first." He still knelt floor, exhausted violence his passion, hanging his head upon his breast, sobbing his heart would break. It sad see him, mere child still, might different, long little reprobate, convicted thief. His face bathed tears, his voice choked sobs, memory past, consciousness much he said true, touched Kenrick compassion; tears rolled his face fast, he felt that, though personal fear could influence him, pity would perhaps force relent, wring his weakness reluctant promise disclose Wilton's discovered guilt. "What I say you, Wilton? know I liked you, I never thought could act like this." "Nor I, Kenrick, short time ago; devil tempted me, I never learned resist." "From heart I _do_ pity you; I fear I _must_ tell; I fear it is duty, I neglected many I dare neglect more; though indeed, I would rather duty this." Wilton clasping his knees harrowing his soul his wild anguish, imploring saved horror open shame, and, accustomed Kenrick grant anything boy, he reduced great distress. Already his whole manner relented loathing anger he first displayed. He could stand present. "O Wilton," he said, "you make ill go like this. I cannot, must not, make promise now; I think do." "I go," said Wilton, deeply abashed; "but I go, promise one thing, Ken, is, even tell me, do not quite cast off. I should not like leave think I had not left _one_ behind give kind thought sometimes." "O Ra, Ra, think _you_ committing thefts!" "You _will_ cast then?" said Wilton, voice broken penitence; "O! bitter bitter thing feel shame like this." "I felt time, Raven. Poor, poor fellow! I I cast off? No, unhappy child, I may tell you, I cease fond you. Go, Wilton; I decide tea-time--you may come hear tea." He already outside door Kenrick called "Wilton, stop!" "What it?" asked Wilton, returning alarmed, conscience made coward. "There!" Kenrick pointed purse lying floor. "Oh, do not ask touch again, money it," said Wilton, hastily leaving room. There acting here; plain he penitent--plain he would given worlds guilty sin. Very sadly, pain doubt, Kenrick thought matter over, thus much least clear him: first, house must informed, though necessarily masters boys; secondly, Wilton must make full immediate restitution he stolen; thirdly, could doubt it, Wilton must get removed once. On conditions he thought possible matter might hushed up; his conscience uneasy point. That unlucky threat hint Wilton's, he could would tell his wrong-doings, his great stumbling-block; whenever extreme pity influenced screen poor boy full exposure, he began ask whether mere cowardly alternative suggested his fears. But this, he would determined lenient merciful course; he face question self-interest earnestly, could he come conclusion he determined take step respects worthy highest side his character, going, case, spontaneously Dr Lane laying frank confession past delinquencies, leaving act he thought fit. Having thus disentangled question personal bearings he able review merits, went ask counsel Whalley, he related, confidence, whole scene exactly occurred. Whalley, too, hearing alternative conditions Kenrick planned, fully inclined spare Wilton much possible, but, neither felt satisfied authority, sought Power's advice and, he felt doubtful matter, he suggested put Dr Lane, without mentioning names, _as hypothetical case_, finally guided his directions. Accordingly Kenrick sought Dr Lane's study, laid entire difficulty him. He listened attentively, said, "If boy young, been, say, misled, accepts sensible conditions proposed, I inclined think course suggested wisest kindest one. You full authority, Kenrick, arrange so, I happy tell behaved throughout matter honourable straightforward way." "I fear, sir, I little deserve approval," said Kenrick, downcast eyes. "In coming ask advice case, I wanted also say I gone far wrong I think ought told badly I behaved. It may I say, may think right allow stay here, sir; rate I shall disburdened conscience telling you, shall perhaps feel less wretched." "My dear Kenrick," said Dr Lane, "it right brave thing come purpose. Confession often first, one trying parts repentance; I hail new proof strong steady desire amend. But tell nothing, dear boy. It may I know suppose; rate, I accept deed, wish hear more, unless, indeed, desire consult clergyman, spiritual adviser, rather master. I seek confidence; anything conscience advice may help relieve you, I _forbid_ proceed, I give help I can." "I think would relieve me, sir," said Kenrick; "I father; I have, I sorry say, friend school I could speak." "Then sit down, Kenrick, assured beforehand real sympathy." He sat down, and, twitching nervously ribbon his straw hat, told Dr Lane much history last two years, confessing, all, badly he behaved head house, much harm he feared his example done. Dr Lane attempt extenuate heinousness his offence, he pointed fruits means repentance. He exhorted let sense his past errors stimulate double future exertions. He told many ways which, kindness, moral courage, Christian principle, he might help blessing boys. He earnestly warned look God strength, watch pray lest he enter temptation. And promising full free oblivion past, he knelt offered overflowing heart words earnest prayer. "There nothing like prayer relieve heart, Kenrick," said Dr Lane; "and now, good-night, God bless you!" With far lighter heart, far brighter hopes, Kenrick left him, feeling great burden rolled away, inwardly blessing doctor his comforting kindness. He found Wilton anxiously awaiting his arrival his study; thinking cases respects resembled other, he strove like unforgiving debtor parable, spoke Wilton great gentleness. "Come here, poor child; first all, let tell shall reported." Wilton repaid look grateful joy. "But must restore stolen money, Wilton; house must told privately; must leave once." "Well, Kenrick, I ask one favour," said Wilton, short pause. "What that?" "That house may told stole money nearly time go." "No; shall kept close till then, otherwise next fortnight would hard bear." "But _must_ I leave?" asked Wilton, appealingly. "It must so, Wilton; _I_ shall sorry you, must settled so. Can manage it?" "O yes," said Wilton, crying quietly; "I will write home tell poor mother it, course she will send money take away once, save expelled. My poor mother, wretched make her!" "Sin makes us wretched, Raven boy. I am sure makes wretched enough. And may not think fear anything letting off, I must tell you, Wilton, I have Dr Lane told many sins I have guilty of." "Have you? Oh! I am sorry; me." "Yes; I am sorry; I am happier it, Raven. There is nothing miserable undiscovered sin--is there?" "Oh, indeed, is not. I am sure I feel happier spite all. No one knows, Ken, I have suffered last fortnight. I have perpetual fright; I have fearful dreams; I have felt ready sink shame; I have always fancying fellows suspected me. Do know, I almost glad caught me, Ken. I am _very_ glad one else, though _horrid, horrid_ moment laid hand shoulder. Yet even is not bad gone nursing guilt secretly, detected." Kenrick musing; boy could talk like clearly one _might_ been, unlike Wilton was. "Wilton," he said, "come draw chair mine I read little story." "O Ken, I am grateful do not hate despise though I a--"; he murmured word "thief" shudder, his breath, he drew his chair, Kenrick read low voice story Achan, till he came verses-- "And Achan, son Carmi, son Zabdi, son Zerah, tribe Judah, taken. "And Joshua said, _My son, give, I pray thee, glory Lord God Israel, make confession unto him_; tell thou hast done, hide me. "And Achan answered Joshua said, Indeed I sinned Lord God Israel, thus thus I done." And Kenrick stopped, Wilton said, "My son! You see Joshua still called `my son' spite his sin mischief." "Yes, Raven boy, was not I read story often struck me. What I wanted see this: The man detected--the thing coming, creeping horribly near him; first his tribe marked fatal lot, his family, his house, himself; he is standing there, guilty detected, midst crowd defeated his baseness, eyes scowling him, he knows he, his sons, his daughters, going burned stoned--at moment Joshua says him, `My son, _give, I pray thee, glory God Israel_.' You see he is _thank God_ detecting him--thank God even frightful moment, frightful death consequence. One would thought was not matter much gratitude jubilation; see _was_, Joshua Achan seem admitted." "Ah, Kenrick!" said Wilton, sadly, "if you would always talked like that, I should not like Achan now." Kenrick said nothing, he received infinite comfort Dr Lane's treatment himself, he took Wilton hand, and, without saying word, knelt down. Wilton knelt beside him, he prayed forgiveness both. A broken, confused, uncertain words only, earnest, came fresh burning heart. They words true prayer, poor, erring, hardened little boy rose his knees overcome speak. CHAPTER THIRTY SEVEN. THE RECONCILIATION AND THE LOSS. The remain, many change pass, Heaven's light alone remains, earth's shadows flee; Life, like dome many coloured glass, Stains white radiance eternity, Until death shiver atoms. Shelley's _Adonais_. The termination Wilton's sojourn Saint Winifred's soon arrived. As yet none two head boys house knew his detection. The thefts indeed ceased; name offender still matter constant surmise, easy task Wilton-- conscious soon would informed--to listen strong terms disgust applied yet unknown delinquent. The barriers his conceit, his coolness, his audacity, broken down; he changed boy; his manner grave silent, he almost hid days Kenrick's study, Kenrick, true kindness, still permitted sit. Meanwhile became generally known he going leave almost immediately; boys often left way division quarter, his departure, though rather sudden, created astonishment, one yet distant conjecture reasons led it. It much say, Wilton one last boys rest would suspected; knew indeed he never professed guided strong moral principles; thought unlikely fellow guilty acts sinned completely schoolboy's artificial code, branded committed charge acknowledged meanness. On evening his departure, house summoned notice Whalley Kenrick meet classroom Preparation. They came, knowing summoned. Whalley opened proceedings requesting boy late money stolen would stand up. Four five rose, stating sums, mostly small, lost, immediately received amount Whalley, much surprise, less content. The duty still remained far less pleasing delicate, Wilton's express earnest request undertaken Kenrick Whalley. It painful moment Kenrick rose, briefly, forbearance gentleness he could command, informed house every reason hope that, time forward, thefts caused much distress, would cease. The offender discovered, he begged all, confidence would grant request, deal harshly him, think harshly him. The guilty boy done could done making full immediate restitution, none need remember injury received his hands, except Elgood, suspicion unjustly thrown, whose forgiveness boy earnestly begged. At part his remarks arose deep silence general murmur "Who it? it?" Wilton, trembling agitation excitement? seated beside Kenrick, almost cowered behind shame, Kenrick stood aside, laying his hand Wilton's head, continued, "He one ourselves, he sitting here," Wilton covered his face hands, stir. An expression surprise emotion thrilled boys present; word spoken; immediately Kenrick said them, "He punished enough; understand terrible thing him. He made reparation far he can, besides this, he _on account_ going leave us to-day. I may tell all, too, he very, very, sorry he done, learned lesson he carry his grave. May I assure forgive freely? May I tell grieved part him, grieved caused it? May I tell that, spite all, he carries warmest wishes best hopes, he leaves enemy behind here?" "Yes, yes!" murmured sides, sound Wilton's crying sounded room, many others also tears. For boy popular; bad he been--and name his sins legion--there something endeared them. Barring last fault, generally proud him; certain generosity him, gay thoughtlessness, boyish daring, admiration. He promising cricketer, active, merry, full spirits: he spoiled notice bigger fellows, one like expect he would turn well. "Then unpleasant task over," said Kenrick, "and I say. Oh, yes; I forgotten, one important thing I say, Whalley reminds me. It this: You know Noelites kept secrets now, always good secrets, I sorry say. But keep honourable secret? Will mention (for occasion it) others school, took money? The matter soon forgotten; let Wilton's sin bruited whole school, give bad name life." "Indeed will not, one us tell," said boys, kept promise admirably afterwards. "Then may separate. You may bid Wilton good-bye wish so, he starts to-night, almost once; carriage waiting now, opportunity seeing again." They flocked round said "good-bye" without one word reproach, one word calculated wound his feelings; many added sincere expressions good wishes future. As Wilton himself, he far much moved _say_ much them, he pressed hands silence, speaking beg Elgood pardon his unkindness, little fellow begged think all. Charlie Evson lingered among last, spoke frank genial warmth. "How must hate me, Charlie, annoying so, trying lead wrong!" said Wilton, penitently. "Indeed I do not, Wilton," said Charlie; "I wish were not going leave. I am sure get better now." "Do not think bad I seemed, Charlie. I ashamed heart time I trying persuade crib tell lies, like fellows. I felt better me." "Well, good-bye, Wilton. Perhaps shall meet day, good friends; I wish happiness heart." Charlie last them, Kenrick Wilton left alone. For Wilton's sake Kenrick tried show cheerfulness he could, he went silent deserted court gate carriage waiting. "Have got luggage, everything right, Raven?" "Yes, everything," he said, taking one last long look familiar scene. It dim moonlight; lights twinkled studies upper boys working, dormitories rest going bed. The tall trees round building stood quite black faintly-lighted sky, waving thinned remnant yellow leaves November air. In stillness heard every slight sound; murmur boys' voices came mingled plashing mountain stream, moaning low waves broke upon shore. A merry laugh rang one dormitories, jarring painfully Wilton's feelings, he stood gazing round silence. He got carriage, sighing heavily grasping Kenrick's hand. "Well, good-bye, Ken; _must_ said last. May I write you?" "I wish would. I shall glad hear you." "And answer me, Ken?" "Of course I will, poor child. Good-bye. God bless you!" They still lingered moment, Kenrick saw moonlight Wilton's face bathed tears. "All right, sir?" said driver. "Yes," said Wilton; "but it is wrong, Ken, I think. Good-bye." He waved his hand, carriage drove darkening night little boy alone, Kenrick sinking heart strolled back his study. Do pry his feelings, terrible ones, he sat his books strong conviction nothing good steady: fulfilment duty driving away heavy thoughts. All his time taken working scholarship. It scholarship ninety pounds year four years, founded princely benefactor school, falling vacant biennially. There scholarships besides this, far valuable one Saint Winifred's; tenure circumscribed conditions, therefore proportionably desirable Kenrick, poor, obtain it. He had, indeed, hardly chance, he well knew; even he succeeded beating Walter, he could expect beat Power. But Power, though graceful finished scholar, strong mathematics, counted something examination, Kenrick's chief chance lay this, scholar he means despised; reliance his abilities, he hoped, fortunate, make defeated classics, considerably ahead branches examination. How he longed his command time he largely wasted! Had he used aright he might easily disputed palm competition Power himself. Few boys gifted stronger intellects clearer heads he. But though _fresh_ time may carefully wisely used, _past_ time wasted never recovered redeemed. And he worked hard day day time quickly flew by, scholarship examination took place, Christmas holidays came on. The result competition could known boys returned school. Mrs Kenrick thought Christmas happiest she known. They spent it, course, quietly. There none happy family gatherings innocent gaieties made time bright others, yet still something peaceful something brighter usual them. Harry's manner, she thought, affectionate, tenderly respectful, often was. There seemed something softer lovable his ways. He bore less haughty indifference towards Fuzbeians; he entered zest simple amusements he could invent procure; he condescended play quite simply curate's little boys, seemed humble contented. She counted days he spent her miser counts his gold; he, he left her, seemed sorry leave, tried cheer her spirits, make light, his will not been, grief separation caused. The first event importance return boys school, announcement scholarship. The list read last name upwards; Henderson stood sixth, Kenrick third, Evson second, _Power first_. "But," said Dr Lane, "Power communicated privately he wish receive emoluments scholarship, he therefore _honorary_ scholar, scholarship held Evson." Disappointed result, he undoubtedly was, yet Kenrick would glad moment able congratulate Walter. He took quietly well. Sorrow failure come often lately, he hardly looked anything else; so, he heard result announced, he tried repress every melancholy thought walking back his study, resumed his day's work though nothing happened. And he sat there, making believe work, thoughts which, spite himself, sadly wandered, knock door, his great joy, less his intense surprise, Walter Evson entered. "O Evson," he said, blushing awkwardness, he remembered long time passed since exchanged word; "I am glad you have come. Sit down. Let congratulate you." "Thanks, Kenrick," said Walter, holding his hand; "I thought gone way long enough. I never ill-feeling you, I feel sure manner none towards me." "None, Walter, none; I _had_ one time, long ceased; error long explained me. I done wrong, Walter, two years more; one many faults, chief all. Can forgive me?" "Heartily, Ken, I anything forgive. We punished enough, I think, losing happiness enjoying continued friends." "Ah, Walter, pains think irrevocable past." "But, Ken, I come definite purpose," said Walter. "You will promise take offence?" "Never again, Walter, you." "Well, then, tell honestly, consequence gain scholarship, which, unexpectedly myself, accident placed you?" Kenrick reddened slightly, made answer, Walter quickly continued--"You know, Ken, I going stay another year; you?" "I am afraid not; guardian think afford it." "Well, then, Ken, I think I may say, without much presumption, that, I stay certain, I may safely reckon getting scholarship next year. At rate, even I do not, father quite rich enough bear university expenses unaided without inconvenience. It would mere selfishness me, therefore, retain scholarship, I mean resign once; let congratulate _you_ heartily Marsden scholar." "Nay, Walter, I cannot make sacrifice sake." "You cannot help it, Ken; free country," said Walter, smiling, "and I may waive scholarship I like. But it is sacrifice whatever, dear fellow; do not say anything it. It gives ten times pleasure hold rather I. So I congratulate you; now, must enough me, I will say good morning." He rose smile leave room, Kenrick, seizing hand, exclaimed-- "O Walter, heap coals fire head. Am I never receive anything benefits I never return?" "Pooh, Ken, benefits friends; let us silent distant friends longer. Power coming study tea to-night; will not join us old days?" "I will, Walter; ghost old days called life?" "Perhaps not; young present, ghost, shall replace old past, Ken. At six of the clock, mind. Good-bye." "Do not go yet: stay little. It greater pleasure I tell see again, Walter. I want talk you." "To make two years' arrears, eh, Ken? Why, pretty little study you have got! Is not odd I never before? It seems quite natural here, somehow. You must come see mine evening; I flatter equals even Power's, beats Flip's beauty, looks sea: jolly view. But must not see till evening. I shall make Charlie put rights honour visit. Charlie beats fag neatness; turn off, eh? I have made fag now, keep his hand in." "Let come back now, Walter; I am sadder wiser since days." "That I will, gladly. I know, too, he will delighted come. Ah, Wilton's photograph, I see," said Walter, still looking him, "I thought greatly improved he left." Kenrick pleased see Walter suspicion _why_ he left, secret kept. They talked very, pleasantly, much say other, Walter had, his simple, easy manner, completely broken ice, made Kenrick feel home again. Kenrick quite loth let go, kept detaining eagerly half hour, seemed like ten minutes, slipped away he left. Kenrick looked forward eagerly meet evening, Power, Henderson, Eden; meeting would fitly inaugurate his return better feelings past days; destined meeting take place; till many evenings afterwards Kenrick sat pleasant society his old friends. When Walter last made good his escape, playfully refusing imprisoned longer, Kenrick rose paced room. He could hardly believe his happiness; delightful moment he experienced many long day; scholarship, long object his hope ambition, attained; impossible seemed, actually his, and, moment, truest friend his boyhood--the friend whose returning respect affection he long yearned--was last restored him. With overflowing heart he sat write his mother, communicate good news he reconciled Walter, Power Walter resigned scholarship his favour. He never felt happier spirits then; then, even moment, cup sincere innocent joy, long untasted, was, one blow, dashed away his lip. For moment post came in, one his fags, humming lively tune, came running letter his door. "A letter you, Kenrick," boy said, throwing carelessly table, taking his merry song he left room. But Kenrick's eyes riveted letter: edged deepest black, bore Fuzby post-mark. For time he sat stupidly staring it: he dared open it. At length he made effort, tore open. It rude, blurred scrawl old servant, telling his mother died day before. A brief note enclosed this, curate place, said, "It quite true, poor boy. Your mother died suddenly spasms heart. God's ways ways. I written tell guardian, he doubt meet here." Kenrick remained stupefied, unable think, almost unable comprehend. He roused his senses entrance his fag remove his breakfast things, still lay table; vague longing comfort sympathy, he sent boy Walter message Kenrick wanted him. Walter came once, Kenrick, trusting his voice speak, pushed letter contained fatal news. In case human consolation cannot reach sorrow. It passes like idle wind wounded heart. All _could_ done words, looks, acts sympathy Walter did; went arrange Kenrick's immediate journey, returning till he came tell carriage waiting take train. That evening Kenrick reached house death, still death itself. The old faithful servant opened door his knock, using her apron wipe her eyes, red long weeping, she exclaimed-- "O Master Harry, Master Harry, she is gone. She reading praying her room, she came quite bright cheerful, spasms took her, I helped her bed, she died." Harry flung his hat hall, rushed stairs his mother's room, he opened door, he stood awe-struck motionless--for he alone presence dead. The light winter sunset streaming her, whose life winter day. Never even life he seen her lovely, beautiful beauty angel, smiling never-broken calm death upon her. Over pure pale face, every wrinkle made care sorrow vanished, streamed last cold radiance evening, Illuminating peaceful smile, seeming linger lovingly lit strange glories golden hair, smoothed soft bands her brow. There she lay her hands folded, though prayer, upon her quiet breast; fitful fever life passed away. Dead--with smile heaven upon her lips, never leave more! Hers hard, mysterious life. In sweet bloom her youthful beauty she left her rich home, not, indeed, without sanction, wishes her relatives, brave trial poverty man she loved. How bitter poverty, severe, unexpected trials proved be, seen already; then, still young, though she meant tread her tender feet whole thorny round human sorrow, she left widow son. And eight years her widowed loneliness, her relatives neglected cold pride her her orphan boy; even orphan boy, midst his love her, his pride waywardness caused her many anxious hour many aching heart, yet she clung affection whose yearning depth tongue utter. And now, still young, she died suddenly, left threshold dangerous youth almost without friend wide world; passed, silence could never broken, eternal world; left him, she loved intensity unspeakable affection, without word, without look, without sign farewell. She passed away moment far-off untroubled shore, whence waving hands cannot seen, sounds farewell voices heard. How must life expand unconceived glory new dawn--the life earth little sunshine visited! She one sweet, pure, unselfish, beautifully blameless God's children; she lived hardship, neglect, anxiety, calumny; she lived among mean wretched villagers: angel among them, knew not; she tasted drink bitter waters affliction; hope brightened, love sustained, her earthly course. And her young orphan son, his heart dead within anguish, his conscience tortured remorse, kneeling agony weak words paint, kneeling last time, _too late_, beside her corpse. Truly life mystery, mind man cannot fathom till glory eternal truth enlighten it! CHAPTER THIRTY EIGHT. THE STUPOR BROKEN. The white stone, unfractured, ranks precious; The blue lily, unblemished, emits finest fragrance; The heart, harassed, finds place rest; The mind, midst bitterness, thinks grief. _The Sorrows Han, Chinese Tragedy_. After days Kenrick returned Saint Winifred's, he supposed, last time. His guardian, stiff, unsympathising man, informed him, his mother's annuity ceased her life, little left support him. The sale, however, house Fuzby, scholarship he won, would serve maintain years, meanwhile his guardian would endeavour secure place merchant's office, gradually he would able earn livelihood. It different life fine, clever high-spirited boy imagined himself, he looked forward prospect settled despair. But he seemed regard victim destiny, regretting nothing, opposing nothing, caring nothing. He told Walter bitter exaggeration "that he must _indeed_ thank giving scholarship, he supposed saved starvation. His guardian, family his own, did not seem care straw him; he friend world besides." And as, days weeks, he brooded gloomy thoughts sad memories, he fell weary, broken, aimless kind life. Many tried comfort him, could reach his sorrow; several ways his school friends could cheer up, failed. He grew moody, solitary, silent. Walter often sought out, talked his lively, cheerful, happy strain; even _his_ society Kenrick seemed shun. He morbid, unhealthy state meet others inspires positive shrinking mind. He seemed pleasure except shutting his study, taking long lonely walks. He performed his house duties mechanically, routine; he read lessons chapel, his voice sounded though came afar, like voice one dreamed; he sat his books long hours, made progress, hardly knowing page he employed. In school, he sat listlessly playing his pen, taking notes, seeming though he heard nothing, scarcely aware going on. His friends could guess would come it, grew afraid saw mope thus inconsolably, pine away without respite, till his eyes grew heavy, his face pale thin. He changed his ways; he seemed altered his nature; he played games, took interest anything, dropped his old pursuits. His work quite spiritless, he grew absent he forgot commonest occupations every day--living waking sleep. Power Walter, talking him, often wondered whether uncertainty his future prospects thus affected him; full belief must something his morbid melancholy, Power mentioned matter Dr Lane soon he opportunity. Dr Lane observed, much pity, depression fastened Kenrick like disease. He surprised see come back deeply affected; "the thoughts youth long, long thoughts," sorrows usually short transient, he looked upon unnatural Kenrick's grief seem thus incurable, young boy like thus refuse comforted. It long he introduced subject, talking Power looking his composition. "Kenrick here, Power," he said; "it pains see sadly altered. I hardly get speak word; things seem equally indifferent him, his eyes look though always ready overflow tears. What manage him? Would little cheerful society brighten up? We day, he speak whole evening. Cannot even Henderson get smile somehow?" "I am afraid not, sir," said Power. "Henderson Evson I tried, he seems avoid seeing one. It makes ill ease apparently. I afraid, one thing, he vexing allowed return, sent merchant's office, he detests." "If all, difficulty it," said Doctor; "we often kept deserving boys here, funds failed, I easily assure his guardian, without his knowing it, expense need moment stand way his return." These generous acts common Saint Winifred's, she indeed _alma mater_ her children; since Kenrick confided particular sorrow _Walter_, Walter undertook remove telling Dr Lane would persuade his guardian let return. Kenrick appeared glad news, though brought little relief, made long change his present ways. Nor even still piece good fortune, his guardian wrote told that, _on condition his sent University_, unknown anonymous friend placed his disposal 100 pounds year, continued time he able maintain himself; generous gift would course permit his receiving advantage Oxford training, obviate necessity his entering office, clearing way one learned professions. This news stirred little, time--but long. He looked upon destiny: he could guess, he hardly tried surmise, unknown friend could be. Nor he know till years afterwards aid given good wealthy Sir Lawrence Power, his son's earnest generous request. For Power kind deed stealth, mentioned one, even Walter; Kenrick little thought he told good news Power, received his kind congratulations, Power known he himself. But still, spite all, Kenrick seemed sick heart, his life crept sluggish course, like river loses bright stream desert, whose silver runnels choked dust sand. The fact was, blows punishment fallen fast heavily he felt crushed earth. The expulsion reprobates he consorted, his degradation censure, Wilton's theft removal, violent tension revulsion feeling caused his awakened conscience, his confession, gnawing sense shame, failure his ambition, his mother's death coming awful climax calamities he undergone, followed cold unfeeling harshness his guardian, damping his hopes--all things broken boy's spirit utterly. Disgrace, sorrow, bereavement, stings remorse, suffering punishment--the forfeiture guilty past, gloom lonely future--these things unmanned him, bowed down, poisoned his tranquillity mind, unhinged every energy his soul, seemed dry springs life. The hand man could rouse stupor caused chastisements God. But rousing came last, due time; came little matter--so slight matter little puff seaward air. A trivial accident, say; yes, one trivial accidents often affect destinies lifetime, and: "Shape ends, Rough-hew will." Kenrick, usual, walking along top cliffs alone-- restless, aimless, miserable--"mooning," boys would called it--unable even analyse his thoughts, conscious folly nurse long-continued hopeless melancholy, yet quite incapable making one strong effort would enabled throw off. And mood he sat near cliff, thinking nothing, watching, idle guesses destination history, vessels passed horizon. The evening drawing-in, cold windy; suddenly remembering he must back tea-time, he rose return. The motion displaced his straw hat, next moment breeze carried little way edge cliff, caught low bush tamarisk. It rested feet him, chalky front cliff sufficiently rough admit his descent. He climbed it, succeeded disengaging his foot, he time seize it, fell, rolled thirty feet. Kenrick, finding he able get tolerable ease, determined continue his descent order secure it. It never occurred hat great importance, would infinitely less trouble walk home without it, buy new one, run risk encounter trouble his climb. However, he _did_ manage reach it, put satisfaction, when, he beginning remount, considerable mass chalk crumbled away his feet, made cling hands avoid precipitated. He able get well enough, because, chalk slipped, he glided safely it, climbing he obliged press his feet strongly downwards order gain his spring; every time he this, he found chalk kept giving way, exhausting futile efforts, filling his shoes dust pebbles, slipping his clothes, blinding his eyes. Every person climbed all, whether Alps elsewhere, knows easy enough get places almost impossible mount again; Kenrick, many attempts, found he imprudent, becoming seriously alarmed, forced, he quite tired fruitless exertions twice nearly fallen, give attempt altogether, his best secure another way escape. This climb quite bottom cliff, make his way, best he could, rocks shingle round bluff shut one side little bay he stood, along narrow line beach, Saint Winifred's head. This possible sometimes, he fancied tide sufficiently far enable now. At rate herein lay, far he saw, his chance safety. Down cliff he climbed more, though ninety feet high he found difficulty this, care, till he came place surface precipitous height ten feet, worn smooth beating waves. Holding his hands edge, he let fall height, found standing, little shaken though unhurt, small pebbly bay indentation shore formed curve line cliffs, series headlands precipices trending away one side far his right, Ness Saint Winifred's reaching his left. Once round headland he would safe, indeed he got beyond little pebbly inlet he stood, he hoped find place he might scale rocks, cross promontory get home. There time lost, he ran his speed loose stones towards bluff, letting unlucky straw hat drop shore, string, impeded obliged hold one hand. Reaching end shingle, he stumbled difficulty scattered rocks slimy ooze seagrass, hoping intense hope he rounded projection cliff, he would see line beach, narrow indeed, still wide enough allow his running along tide come in, reaching part Saint Winifred's Head he might able scale means sheep-path, help hands knees. Very quickly he reached corner, hardly dared look; he _did_ look, glance showed slender hope left. At one spot tide already reached foot cliffs; he could get spot water yet sufficiently shallow allow run it, he trusted he might yet saved. The place far-off, he ran ran; ever he ran place seemed get farther farther, his knees failed fatigue, he sank every step noisy yielding mixture sand pebbles. Reader, ever run race sea? If not, accept testimony one once, painful exciting race. I ran successfully one who, though escaped, since overtaken swallowed great dark waves sea, whose tides ever advancing upon us, must sooner later absorb us all--the great dark waves Death. But take life hand, run know sea gaining upon you, that, however great speed fear wings feet, subtle hundred-handed enemy intercepting many deep inlets, bate instant's speed, withhold hair's-breadth danger--is awful thing feel. And see _has_ intercepted worst all; moment forgotten. And Kenrick undergo. He ran he panted breath, stumbled weariness--but he late. A broad sheet water bathed bases cliff, waves, though angry opposing breeze, leaping frantic hiss, deluging rocks sheets spray foam. Experience taught speed fury dangerous coast treacherous tide came in. There moment spare, he flew back small shelter pebbly cove, water already gliding close him, stretching arms like hungry medusa round seaweed-matted lumps scattered rock he strode. His face wetted salt dew, his brown hair scattered rising wind, he flew rather ran place he descended, renew wild attempt scale cliff seemed afford shadow hope. Yet mere glance might enough show hope vain. Both spot, far he could see, sheer base cliff offered place possible rest foot, place he could mount three feet shingle. But his scrutiny brought home another appalling fact--namely, sea-mark, highest tide fringed barriers triumphal wreath hanging seaweed, foliage grew, high upon cliff, far his head. It late curse his rashness folly, would he even try face his frightful situation till he thought every conceivable means escape. A friend mine had, I suppose still has, pen-and-ink sketch made one shudder look it. All see long sea-wall, apparently side stone pier, drawn give impression great height, top visible picture; side ripples plashes long dark reach sea water, lazily waving weeds planted crevices stone, extending, like wall itself, farther guess. The living thing picture single spent, shaggy dog, paws rested moment sort hollow wall, half dripping body emergent dark water. It staring look despondent exhaustion, yet mute appeal. The sketch powerfully recalls typifies exact position poor Kenrick: found placed--before hungry, angry darkening sea, behind inaccessible bastions forbidding cliff. It horrible predicament, thrillingly appreciate who, like author, themselves. There yet one thing, one thing only, tried, truly refuge desperation. Kenrick excellent swimmer; many time bathing Saint Winifred's, even he little boy, he struck boldly far bay, even far huge tumbling red buoy, spent restless life "ever climbing climbing wave." If he could swim pleasure, could he swim life? It true swim was, beyond comparison, farther hazardous he ever dreamt of. But swimming art inspires extraordinary confidence; makes us fancy drowning impossible us, cannot imagine fatigued fail keeping water. Kenrick knew attempt one undertaken dire extremity; extremity arrived, literally last chance lay and--what he would think yet. So, wintry air, strong wind blowing keenly red gleam sunset already beginning fail, he flung his clothes damp beach, one rushes forlorn hope teeth enemy, he ran rough uneven shore, hardly noticing much hurt his feet, plunged boldly hideous yeast seething waves. The cold made shiver shiver every limb; his teeth chattered; he afraid cramp; slimy seaweeds his feet touched, tangled rotting string sea-twine waved his legs, sent strong shudder him; sick clammy feeling frothy spume he plunge. But he ploughed his way this, fairly his depth, exercise warmed him, he rose swimmer's triumphant motion yielding waves. On he swam, thinking that, looking him; he began feel quite tired, _did_ look, he saw he nearly halfway headland. He saw, too, breakers lashing fighting iron shore he madly striving reach. Even he could swim far--and he _felt_ he could not--how could he ever land spot? Would one billows toss playful spray, dash dashed unpitied offspring, dead upon rocks? And conviction dawned him, withering his energy heart, wind wailed him, water bubbled his ears, sea-mew, napping flew past him, uttered his head plaintive scream. His heart sank within him. With quick motion he turned water, arms wearied-out he swam back again, dear life, towards little landing-place alone divided instant death; struggling heavily, limbs weary he could barely move waves, whose increasing swell often broke around his head. Already tide reached spot he let his straw hat drop beach; sea scornfully playing it, tossing down, whirling round round like feather; wind blew sea, sea, receiving gifts enemy, flung back again; wind carried day, Kenrick wringing brine his dripping hair, huddling his clothes his wet, benumbed, aching limbs, he saw straw hat fairly launched, floating away waves. And that, vision sudden death glared his eyes, horror leapt upon him, scream--a loud, wild, echoing scream, sounded strange lonely place, rose rude song wind singing,--broke his blanched lips. And another, another, silence; Kenrick crouching cliff's foot furthest swelling flood, his eyes fixed motionless wild stare advancing line foam. He conjuring his imagination time waves reached him; swept away shelter shore, risen his lips; forced struggle swim, his strength, already impaired hunger, thirst, cold, fatigue, failed altogether, he would sink, water gurgle wildly his ears, stop his breath--and would still. And he pictured scene vividness made experience agony, time his mind flew back faultful past day; memory lighted her lantern, threw blaze every dark corner, every hidden recess, every forgotten nook--left spot unsearched, unilluminated sudden flash; his past sins him, words, looks, thoughts, everything. As man descends light his diving-bell heaving sea, strange monsters deep, attracted unknown glimmer, throng wallow terribly around him, uncouth thoughts forgotten sins welter fearful multitudes round light memory deep sea poor human soul. And finally, though demon voices, came message whispered him, touted tauntingly, rising falling maddening alternation rising falling wind--"You wasting life, moodily abandoning idle misery, neglecting duties, letting talents rust--_God take life know use_." And then, though answer this, another voice, low, soft, sweet, his heart knew well--another voice filling interspaces others unseen music, whispered soothingly--"It shall given again, use better; awake, use better, _it shall given again_." Those three wild shrieks his heard; he know it, heard. The whole coast general lonely could usually pace miles without meeting single human being, never even occurred one might pass way. But happened boisterous weather last days cast away schooner place five miles Saint Winifred's, Walter Evson walked Charlie see wreck, returning along cliff. As passed spot Kenrick was, first startled horrified shrieks, stood listening another came ears, piercing, heart-rending rest. "Good heavens! _must_ one there!" exclaimed Walter. "Why, could one got there?" asked Charlie. "Well, did not hear one scream?" "Yes, several times. O Walter, look here!" Charlie pointed traces cliff showing one descended there. "Who could wanted get _there_, I wonder; possible purpose?" "Do see one, Walter?" "No, I do not; there is nothing sea"--for Kenrick, crouching cliff, hidden sight, tide come far that, summit, none shingle visible--"but what is that?" "Why, Walter, _it's straw hat_; must one fellows there; I see ribbon distinctly, dark blue white, twisted together." "_Dark blue white_! why, then, must one football eleven: Charlie, must Kenrick! Heavens, happened?" "Kenrick!" shouted top voices. But cliff high, wind, momently rising blast, swept away shouts, although Kenrick might heard distinctly ordinary circumstances, mingled with, gave new form body to, wild madness terror beginning kindle his brain. So shouted, answer came. "No answer comes, Charlie; there is someone sure here," said Walter. Charlie already begun try descend face cliff. "Stop, stop, Charlie," said Walter, seizing dragging again, "you must not try that--nay, Charlie, really _must not_. If it is possible _I_ will." He tried, three minutes showed that, however practicable descent might be, ascent afterwards would wholly beyond his power. Besides, he descend, could he do? Clearly nothing; another plan view, he difficulty reached his former position. "Nothing done way, Charlie." At moment another cry came, Kenrick, momentary lull wind, fancied he heard sounds voices his perturbed agitated fancy. "Ha! heard that?" said Walter, he shouted again, sound returned. "We must fly Saint Winifred's, Charlie; there is boy shore beyond doubt. You stay behind, like, cannot run fast me. I am afraid, though, it is least good. Saint Winifred's three miles here, long I have got help come three miles back, it is clear one alive there; still must try," he starting Charlie seized his arm. "Do not remember, Walter, hut Bryce's cove? There is old boat there, it is mile half nearer Saint Win's." "_Capital_ boy, Charlie," said Walter; "how good think it; it is thing. Come." They flew along full speed, Walter taking Charlie's hand, saying, "Never mind stretching legs once, even _are_ tired. How well run! shall time." They gained cove, flew steep narrow path, reached hut door. Their summons answered furious barking dog. No one in. "Never mind: there is boat; must take French leave;" Walter, springing down, hastily unmoored it. "Wah! horrid old tub, wants baling, Walter." "We cannot stay that, Charlie boy; it is good thing Semlyn Lake taught us row, is not it?" "O yes; do not wish little _Pearl_ now, Walter? Would not make fly, instead cranky old wretch." "Well, must fancy _Pearl_ Semlyn Lake," said Walter, wading knees launch boat, springing he given final shove. They excellent rowers, Charlie never tried his skill sea like that, timid, every excuse. "How rough is, Walter," he said, boat tossed like egg-she will high waves. "Keep heart, Charlie, row steadily; do not afraid." "No, Walter, I will not, you are me; but--Walter?" "Well?" "It will dark half hour." "Not quite, shall time; need not go far out, tide's us." So two brave brothers rowed steadily on, one remark Charlie, ushered word-- "Walter?" "Anything frighten with, Charlie?" he answered cheerily; "you shall not succeed." "Well, Walter," he answered, little touch shame, "I going say that, look, you will see oar's broken, spliced together." "I have seen along, Charlie, use oar gingerly; now, Charlie, I see you are little frightened, boy. I am going brace up. Rest oar minute." He so. "Now turn round _look_." He pointed his finger dark figure, distinctly seen, cowering low white cliff's foot. "O Walter, I am ready; I will not say word more;" he leant his oar, plied like man. It pretty, delightful thing, idle summer-time lie full length upon beach ambrosial summer evening, glow floats water, whose calm surface tenderly rippled gold blue. And children play beside you, dabbling paddling wavelets, digging ridges yellow sand, take print pattering footsteps, nothing pleasant let transparent stream quiet tide plash musically light motion feet; nothing pleasant listen silken murmurs, watch flow upwards beneficent coolness, take possession shore. But different thing rises behind wall frowning cliff, precipitous, inaccessible, affording hope refuge; when, golden calm summer eventide, cheerless drawing-in loud stormy February night; furious hissing violence rock-and-wind-struck breakers violet-coloured margin rippling waves--knowing wind wailing forth requiem, that, fall every breaker, unseen hands ringing knell death. The boy crouched there, his face white cliffs him, his undried limbs almost powerless cold, his clothes wetted spray--pushing aside every moment dripping locks hair wind scattered his forehead, he might look hollow, staring eyes Death advancing towards him, wrapping already huge mantle-folds, calling aloud him, beckoning him, freezing bone touch icy hands. And brutal tide coming on, according pitiless irreversible certainty fixed laws governed it--coming like huge wallowing monster, dumb blind--knew not, recked not, young life quivered verge advance--that devour remorselessly, wrath satiate, hunger appease. None less boy's presence, unregardful his growing horror wild suspense, continued uncouth play--leaping rocks, springing upwards stretching high hands pluck cliffs, seeming laugh fell back shattered exhausted, unsubdued; charging sometimes like herd white horses, bounding one other, shaking foaming manes-- hissing sometimes like brood huge sea-serpents, insinuated winding streams among boulders shore. It might seemed sport _him_ ran first his feet, playfully splashed him, bather might splash person shore head heel, ran back moment, little farther, till, he sat extreme line shore his back huddled close cliff, first wetted soles his feet, his shoes, ankle-deep, knee deep, waist. Already seemed buoy up; he knew moments he would forced swim, last struggle would commence. His brain dull, his senses blunted, his mind half-idiotic, first (for his eyes fixed downwards growing, encroaching waters) he caught glimpse, failing daylight, black outline boat, twenty yards him, caught sound plashing oars. He stared eagerly it, came beside he lost his strength, uttered faint cry, slipped fainting waves. CHAPTER THIRTY NINE. ON THE DARK SEA. Boys Leaning upon oars, splash strain, Made white foam green purple sea. Shelley. In moment Walter's strong arms caught him, lifted tenderly boat. While waves tossed placed full length comfortably could,--which comfortably--and though his clothes streaming salt water, his fainting fit still continued, began row home. For, time, dim twilight; wind blowing great guns, clouds full dark wrath, stormy billows rose higher higher. There time spare, would much could provide safety. The tide already bumping cliff place where, time, rescued Kenrick, and, order get fairly off, Walter, forgetting moment, pushed his oar pressed cliff. The damaged oar weak enough already, instantly Walter saw his vigorous shove weakened displaced old splicing blade. Charlie observed it, neither spoke word; contrary, little boy his place, oar rowlock, immediately smote lightly good time surface water, splashed white foam, pulled gallant strokes. They made little way; waves pitched high dropped heavy fall rolling troughs, rowing became almost impossible, miserable old boat shipped quantities water. At last, stronger pull usual, Walter's oar creaked, snapped, gave way, flinging his back. The loosened twine spliced half rotten age; broke several places, oar blade fell floated away, Walter left holding hands broken futile stump. "My God, us!" wild cry sudden awful misfortune wrung his lips; Charlie, shipping his useless oar, clung round his brother's neck cried aloud. The three boys--one faint, exhausted, speechless--were unsafe oarless boat open tempestuous sea, weltering hopelessly cruel mercy winds waves; current sweeping knew whither, wind, howling like hurricane, driving farther farther away land. "O Walter, I cannot die, I cannot die yet; black sea, away every one." "From every one God, Charlie; I you. Cheer up, little brother, God desert us." "O Walter, pray God Kenrick | pray Him life." "We pray, Charlie;" folding his arms round him, rowing nothing left do, little boy frightened increasing gloom, Walter, calm even wild moment, calm clear conscience noble heart, poured forth his soul words supplication, Charlie, his voice half stifled tears, sobbed terrified response echo his prayer. And prayer Walter's heart lightened his spirit strengthened, till he felt ready meet anything brave fate; his soul ached pity his little brother his friend. It his duty cheer could done. Kenrick far recovered move say words, brothers his side moment. "You saved life, Walter, I given up; saved it, I hope, purpose time," he whispered, unconscious yet his position; he dragged his feet pool water lying bottom boat. But gradually situation dawned upon him. "How you are rowing?" he asked; "are tired? let _me_ try, I think I could manage." "It would use, Ken," said Walter; "I mean cannot row," he pointed broken oar. "Then saved risk, perhaps cost, lives. O noble, noble Walter!" said Kenrick, tears gushing his eyes. "How awfully terrible is! I seem snatched death death. Life death battling to-night; yes, eternal life death too," he whispered Walter's ear, catching wrist. "All danger me, Walter, sin. I like Jonah ship; I buffeting death away hours, he sent me, he must his mission. I see _I_ cannot escape, but, O God, I hope _you_ escape, Walter. Your life Charlie's must spilt mine." It barely light enough see his face, looked wild haggard ragged gleams moonlight black flitting clouds suffered break forth intervals; his words, this, incoherent understand. Walter saw long intensity fear rendered half delirious master himself. Soon he sank stupor, half sleep, half exhaustion, even lurching boat rouse more. "Walter, he is asleep, or--oh! he dead, Walter?" asked Charlie, horror. "No, no, Charlie; there, put hand upon his heart. You see beats; he exhausted, sort swoon." "But he pitched over, Walter." "Then I will show we will do, Charlie. We must make best everything." Walter lifted useless rudder, pulled string lash Kenrick safely stern bench he lay, took his coat order cover he might sleep; then, anxious things relieve Charlie's terror, unselfish boy, thinking others, sat beside centre bench, encircled protecting arm. And, though increase misery, cold rain began fall torrents. "O Walter, it is cold, wet, stormy, pitch dark. I am frightened, Walter. I try be, I cannot help it. Take knees pray us again." Walter took his knees, laid his head his breast, folded his arms, wiped his tears; little boy's sobs ceased Walter's voice rose strain intense prayer. "Walter, God _must_ grant prayer; I am sure He must; He cannot reject it," said Charlie simply. "He answer way best us, Charlie; whatever is." "But shall die?" asked his brother again, cold shudder word. "Remember said now, Charlie, brave. But even die, could die better, little brother, duty, trying save dear Ken's life? It is not terrible thing, Charlie, all. We must die time, know, boys died young younger me." "Ay, like this, Walter: icy, black, horrid waters." "Yes, indeed, Charlie; little friendless sailor-boys dashed far-away rocks splintered ships atoms, swallowed vessel foundered great typhoons, thousands miles away home England, unknown seas; little boys like you, Charlie; died bravely, too, though living soul near hear cries, nothing mark graves bubble one minute sank." "Have they, Walter?" "Ay, many many time have; God Who called lives gave courage strength die, He give us need." There pause, Charlie said, "Talk me, Walter; prevents listening flapping plunging boat, noises. Walter, I think... I think shall die." "Courage, brother, I hope yet; die die like together--I let go. Our bodies shall washed ashore together--not separated, Charlie, even death." "You dear, dear good brother me. How I love you, Walter!" he pressed yet closer him, he said bravely, "What hope then, Walter?" "Look up, Charlie; see light?" "Yes; it?" "Sharksfin Lighthouse; do not remember seeing sometimes night Saint Win's? Yes; lights twinkling far-off Saint Win's. Those must school lights; long windows see chapel windows. They chapel now, lights would not there. Perhaps friends--Power, perhaps, Eden--are praying us; must missed us since tea-time." "How I wish them!" "Perhaps may again; wiser better heart life solemn time, Charlie. If carried wind current within hearing lighthouse!" The Sharksfin Lighthouse built sharp high rock two miles sea. I watched Bleak Point bright, warm summer's day, promontory around ablaze purple heather golden gorse, breeze enough shake wing butterfly rested blue-bell, disturb honey-laden bee murmured thyme. Yet even waters seething boiling never-ended tumult hideous sunken rocks; ocean around hoary neesings thousand leviathans floundering monstrous depths. You may guess wild February night--how, mighty rush Atlantic, torn breakers beat tremendous rage, till whole sea angry motion like demon caldron seethes roaring flame. Drifting along, rather flung battered current, passed within near sight lighthouse, might thanked God passed nearer, passed nearer would certain death. The white waves dashed it, enveloped tall strong pillar buffeted back, like noble midst calumny persecution; _they_ fell back hissing discomfited, could dim silver quench flame _it_ glowed steady lustre midst them--flung victorious path splendour raging motion, warned sunken reef weary mariner, looked forth untroubled broad, calm eye madness fury tempest-haunted night. Through broad track light boat driven, Walter shouted top his voice his remaining strength. The three men lighthouse fancied indeed, acknowledged afterwards, heard shouts; strange, mysterious, inarticulate voices often borne upon wind, haunt always lonely wastes foamy sea. The lighthouse men often heard unexplained wailings weird screams. Many time looked out, continually deceived, unless human accents unmistakable well-defined, attribute sounds agencies, secret phenomena worst storms. And even _had_ heard, could done, launched boat billows running mountain-high perilous rock? Charlie quiet long time, his face hidden Walter's shoulder; he seen glare light threw across waves, observed gradually driven blackness again, he asked, "Have passed lighthouse, Walter?" "We have." "Oh, I hungry burning thirst! Oh! shall do?" "Try think it, Charlie; little fasting will not hurt us much." Another long pause, clung closely other, hearts beat side side, Charlie said, barely articulate whisper-- "Walter!" "I know going say, Charlie." "The water boat nearly knees." "We shipped great deal, know." "Yes; besides that--" "Yes, true; leak. Do mind putting trying I bail water out?" "O Walter, do not put knee--do not let go me." "Very well, Charlie; would not much use." "Good God!" cried little boy paroxysm agony, "we sinking--we foundering!" They wound arms round other, Walter said, "It even so, darling brother. Death near, God us; death, death means rest heaven. Good-bye, Charlie, good-bye; close together till end." CHAPTER FORTY. WHAT THE SEA GAVE UP. The sands yeasty surges mix At midnight dreary bay;-- And thy ribs limpet sticks, And thy bones scrawl shall play. Tennyson. Anxiety reigned Saint Winifred's, succeeded consternation intense grief. Little thought absence three boys tea-time, came chapel-time bed-time, yet appeared, next morning found heard night, everyone became seriously alarmed, neighbouring country searched intelligence. The place cliff Kenrick descended observed, traces showed _one_ boy gone there, discovery, far explaining matters, rendered inexplicable. Additional light thrown subject disappearance Bryce's boat, worst fears seemed confirmed his information ricketty old concern, intended paddle smooth weather close shore. But earthly reason could induced three boys venture tub wild night? That pleasure inconceivable, rowing strictly forbidden; reason could suggested, conjecture fault. The fishermen went smacks, found traces, gained tidings missing boys; weary anxious day belief lost sea gained ground. Almost day Power, Eden, Henderson, gazing sea, wandering shore, vain hope seeing come rowing across bay; sailors shore affirmed _had_ gone open boat, particularly Bryce's boat, utter impossibility could outlived tempest preceding night. At last, towards evening, sea gave up, indeed her dead, accepted positive proof wretched fate. Henderson, fever excitement, Power vainly strove allay, walking Eden, hardly less troubled, along beach, he caught sight something floating along, rising falling dumb sullen swell advancing tide. He thought declared first, start horror, light hair drowned boy; soon saw could that, dashing waist-deep it, Henderson brought _the torn battered fragments straw hat_. The ribbon, dark blue white, though soaked discoloured, still served identify belonged Saint Winifred's boy; and, carefully examining flannel lining, saw piece linen sewn upon it--only legible still--the name "H. Kenrick." Nor found. The discovery quickened search, soon afterwards Power, sudden suppressed cry, pointed something black, lying, dreadful look it, far part sand. Again hearts grew cold, running recognised, fresh horror despair, _the coat Walter last worn_. They recognised it, besides this, place matter beyond doubt, his name marked inside sleeve. In one pockets his school notebook, notes he taken, playful caricatures he scribbled pages; other, stained salt water, tearing every touch, letters he last received. All next day doubt growing certainty. Mr Mrs Evson summoned Semlyn, came feelings cannot depicted. Power gave Mrs Evson coat he picked up, he Henderson hardly ever left parents friend, could cheer spirits support hopes could hardly feel themselves. To day Mrs Evson cherishes coat dear sacred relic, reminds her mercy sustained her first great agony she endured her happy life. Power kept poor Kenrick's hat, relation his claim it. Another day dawned, settled grief gloom fell alike Saint Winifred's--the boys, masters, inhabitants. The sight Mr Mrs Evson's speechless anguish impressed hearts, time hope seemed quenched ever. For one boy only,--though young hearts slow give hope--had refused believe worst. It Eden. He _persisted_ three boys must picked up. The belief come upon suddenly, grown upon he knew how, he _sure_ it; therefore his society brought relief comfort torn heart mother. "What made confident?" she asked. He know; he seen it, dreamt it, _felt_ somehow, he felt unalterably convinced was. "They come back, dear Mrs Evson, come back, see," his repeated asseveration; oppressed her heart doubt fear, she never weary words. And fourth day, Mr Evson absent, gone make enquiries London ships passed Saint Winifred's day, Eden, radiant joy, rushed Dr Lane's drawing-room, Mrs Evson sitting, utterly regardless _les convenances_, burst exclamation, "O Mrs Evson, true, true I always told you. Did not I say I knew it? They _have_ picked up." "Hush, boy; steady," whispered Mrs Lane; "you delivered message less suddenly. The revulsion feeling sorrow joy much her." "O Eden, tell me," said mother faintly, recalling her senses bewildered shock intelligence; "are certain? Oh, boys?" "You see soon," he said gently; next moment, confirm his words, door new open, Charlie Evson wrapped his mother's arms, strained her heart, covered her kisses, his bright young face bathed her tears gratitude joy. "Charlie, darling Charlie, Walter?" her first words. "What, do not know then, mother; kiss spare me?" said playful voice boy enveloped sailor's blue she will-jacket; Walter's turn feel long embrace agonising fondness mother's love. Kenrick looking little sadly--not envious, made sorrowful memory. But next moment Walter, taking hand, introduced his mother she kissed cheek. "Your name familiar me, Kenrick," she said; "and shared dangers." "Walter twice saved life, Mrs Evson," he answered, "and time, I trust, he saved senses one." The boys' story soon told. Just boat beginning sink, bitterness death seemed over, Walter caught sight lights ship, saw her huge dark outline looming far them, towering waves. Instantly he Charlie shouted frantic energy reviving hope. By God's mercy shouts heard; spite risk difficulty caused turbulence night, ship hove to, long-boat manned, amazed sailors rescued ten minutes wretched boat swirled round sank bottom. Nothing could exceed care tenderness sailors good captain _Morning Star_ treated them. The genial warmth captain's cabin, food wine stood much need, rest quiet, long, long sleep, continued nearly twenty-four hours, recruited failing strength, restored perfect health. Past Saint Winifred's Bay extends miles miles long range iron-bound coast, circumstance, together violence breeze blowing away land, prevented captain opportunity putting ashore morning day, when, kind-hearted liberality, he also supplied money requisite pay way Saint Winifred's. "You cannot think jolly board, mother," said Charlie. "I have learnt ships, fun; kind us possible." "You must not suppose did not think you, mother dearest," said Walter, "and anxious would be; felt sure would believe ship picked us up." "Yes, Walter; taste joy worth past sorrow," said his mother. "You must thank friend Eden mainly keeping spirits, he almost person maintained still alive." "And now, Mrs Evson," said Power, "you must spare ten minutes, masters school impatient see congratulate them." The whole story spread among boys ten minutes, proud recognise Walter's chivalrous daring. When he appeared blue jacket Captain Peters replaced loss his coat, Kenrick's arm his, holding Charlie's hand, cheer cheer broke assembled boys; finally, unable repress joy enthusiasm, lifted three shoulders chaired round court. You may suppose joyful dinner party evening Dr Lane's. Mr Evson, conjectured, heard his son's safety London captain _Morning Star_, he tendered his warmest grateful thanks, whom, leaving London, he presented, testimony his gratitude, exquisite chronometer. Returning Saint Winifred's he found his two boys seated happily drawing-room awaiting him, mother's hand theirs, company best boy-friends. Walter still blue she will-jacket, became well, neither Mrs Lane boys would suffer change. It indeed evening never forgotten, hardly less joyous memorable grand breakfast Sixth gave Walter Kenrick memory event, which, special exception, little Charlie also invited. Rejoicings good, saved greater better things. These three young boys stood face face sudden death. Death, were, laid his hand shoulders, taken hair looked upon them, bade commune themselves; and, he released stern cold grasp, gave lives awful reality. It quench, indeed, natural mirthfulness, filled strong purposes high thoughts. Kenrick returned Saint Winifred's changed boy; long-continued terror quite altered expression his countenance, but, effect soon wore off, _moral_ effects produced happily permanent. He began life earnest; listlessness, moody fits sorrow, bursts wayward self-indulgence. He became strenuous, diligent, modest, earnest, kind; he too, like Walter Charlie, began his career "_from strength strength_." Under him, Power, Walter, others, influence formed moulded tradition left behind them, Saint Winifred's flourished more, added new honours benefits old famous name. At end half-year Power left, he Balliol Scholarship carried nearly prizes school. Walter succeeded head school; he Kenrick (who restored his old place list) worked heart soul together good it. In days indeed happy prosperous state-- renowned honoured without, well governed high toned within. Dr Lane felt acknowledged much success due example vigour head boys. Power, he left, beloved distinguished; Walter Kenrick trod his steps. To boundless delight school carried one year highest open scholarship University; also left, successful Power, were, possible, even universally beloved. Whalley carried another year high tradition, and, due time, little Charlie also attained head place school, behaved identify his name Walter's happiest wisest institutions many years. CHAPTER FORTY ONE. L'ENVOI. Is to-day enough? I peer Into darkness day come? Is to-morrow e'en yesterday? Relics Shelley. May I leave here? Where could I leave better marble threshold promising boyhood; still happy noble freshness feelings, brightness hopes, enthusiasm thoughts? Need I say word after-life, fading earlier visions, coldness hardness ways? I like linger here; shake hands farewell, leave boys I knew. They living still, happy highly honoured world. In case "the boy father man;" reader understood sympathised early life ask draw aside curtain, even moment, show appeared summers seen grow full stature manhood. I said living still; them. Charlie Evson alone, little band amongst number friends Saint Winifred's--alone, though youngest all--is dead. He died violent death. Filled missionary spirit, desirous, like Edward Irving, "something high heroical religion age affecteth," he joined mission one great groups Pacific Islands. And there, many time, evening, day spent teaching natives plant fields build houses, he would gather round twilight, and, cool wind wandered his hair brow, shook overhead graceful plumes cocoa-palm, he would talk low sweet tones, fireflies twinkling thicket stars stole one another silent myriads, One Who came highest Heaven redeem savagery degradation, make holy He holy, pure He pure. He eminently successful; he planted islands first seeds fruitful Christianity, he sailed reefs, still carrying everlasting gospel his hands. One evening little missionary ship, Charlie built, drew near land, saw natives drawn threatening attitude beach. Trusting conciliate kindness presents, young missionary, taking glittering trifles attract notice, proceeded small band followers towards shore. At first natives seemed inclined receive well, suddenly, wild impulse barbarians liable, one savages pierced sailor his spear. Evson, effort strength, wrenched weapon his hand told his men take wounded sailor retreat. This effected safety, islanders struck awed young Englishman's high bearing firm attitude; his eye fixed quietly upon kept back. He last step boat, and, he turned so, one wretches struck head his accursed club. He fell stunned bleeding upon beach, instant dispatched spears clubs hundred savages, boat's crew barely escaped lives, little mission vessel, spreading her sails, could difficulty elude pursuit canoes, swarmed creeks give her chase. The corpse lay bleeding upon nameless strand, soft fair hair mother's hand fondled mother's lips kissed, dangled trophy girdle cannibal. Thus Charlie died; marble tablet Semlyn Church, ornamented delicate exquisite sculpture, records his tragic fate, stands monument his parents' tender love. As boy he shown martyr's dauntless spirit; man he suffered win rare high glory martyr's crown. Of Walter, Henderson, Sir Reginald Power--for Power succeeded early his father's title estates--I need say more. Their days youth maturity linked together natural progress things charitable, great, good. They belie early promise. The breeze happy life bore gently onward, cast anchor widening stream. They brave manly honourable boys, grew high-minded honourable men. I wish suppose bitter trials suffer, exempt degree common sorrows. In turbulent restless period life passions strong heart wild wilful full pride, while, time, judgment often weak thoughts immature crude, (as have) purchase wholesome experience price suffering; remember shame follies, mourn mistakes. In saying this, I say faultless; us is? But, time, I may fairly say often meet nobler manlier boys youths these; errors committed humbly endeavoured patience carefulness amend; used talents well wisely, striving live love charity around them; kept fear God eyes never lost freshness geniality early years, kept "The young lamb's heart amid fall grown flocks;"--kept heart boyhood taken purified powers manhood. And reason eye sees loves them, tongue speaks blesses them. And end comes comes all; when--as though child trample sparks piece paper--death comes upon tramples ever joys sorrows, hopes fears--then, sure I am, mourn them, cherish memory regret loss, neither insincere few, meet calmly gladly Great Shadow, waiting looking sure though humble hope better less transient life; sinless unstained world; meeting long lost friends; rest remaineth People God. And here, gentle reader, let us bid farewell. THE END.
