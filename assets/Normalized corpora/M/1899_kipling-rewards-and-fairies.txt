Introduction Once upon time, Dan Una, brother sister, living English country, good fortune meet Puck, alias Robin Goodfellow, alias Nick Lincoln, alias Lob-lie-by-the-Fire, last survivor England mortals call Fairies. Their proper name, course, ‘The People Hills’. This Puck, means magic Oak, Ash, Thorn, gave children power To see see hear hear, Though happened three thousand year. The result time time, different places farm fields country about, saw talked rather interesting people. One these, instance, Knight Norman Conquest, another young Centurion Roman Legion stationed England, another builder decorator King Henry VII’s time; forth; I tried explain book called PUCK OF POOK’S HILL. A year later, children met Puck more, though older wiser, wore boots regularly instead going barefooted got chance, Puck kind ever, introduced people old days. He careful, course, take away memory walks conversations afterwards, otherwise he interfere; Dan Una would find strangest sort persons gardens woods. In stories follow I trying tell something people. COLD IRON When Dan Una arranged go breakfast, remember Midsummer Morning. They wanted see otter which, old Hobden said, fishing brook weeks; early morning time surprise him. As tiptoed house wonderful stillness, church clock struck five. Dan took steps across dew-blobbed lawn, looked his black footprints. ‘I think ought kind poor boots,’ he said. ‘They will get horrid wet.’ It first summer boots, hated them, took off, slung round necks, paddled joyfully dripping turf shadows lay wrong way, like evening East. The sun well warm, brook last night mist still fumed water. They picked chain otter’s footprints mud, followed bank, weeds drenched mowing, birds shouted surprise. Then track left brook became smear, though log dragged along. They traced Three Cows meadow, mill-sluice Forge, round Hobden’s garden, slope till ran short turf fern Pook’s Hill, heard cock-pheasants crowing woods behind them. ‘No use!’ said Dan, questing like puzzled hound. ‘The dew’s drying off, old Hobden says otters’ll travel miles.’ ‘I am sure we have travelled miles.’ Una fanned herself her hat. ‘How still is! It is going regular roaster.’ She looked valley, chimney yet smoked. ‘Hobden’s up!’ Dan pointed open door Forge cottage. ‘What d’you suppose he breakfast?’ ‘One them. He says eat good times year,’ Una jerked her head stately pheasants going brook drink. A steps farther fox broke almost bare feet, yapped, trotted off. ‘Ah, Mus’ Reynolds--Mus’ Reynolds’--Dan quoting old Hobden,--‘if I knowed knowed, I would know something.’ [See ‘The Winged Hats’ PUCK OF POOK’S HILL.] I say,’--Una lowered her voice--‘you know funny feeling things happened before. I felt said “Mus’ Reynolds.”’ ‘So I,’ Dan began. ‘What it?’ They faced other, stammering excitement. ‘Wait shake! I will remember minute. Was not something fox--last year? Oh, I nearly then!’ Dan cried. ‘Be quiet!’ said Una, prancing excitedly. ‘There something happened met fox last year. Hills! Broken Hills--the play theatre--see see--’ ‘I remember now,’ Dan shouted. ‘It is plain nose face--Pook’s Hill--Puck’s Hill--Puck!’ ‘I remember, too,’ said Una. ‘And it is Midsummer Day again!’ The young fern knoll rustled, Puck walked out, chewing green-topped rush. ‘Good Midsummer Morning you! Here is happy meeting,’ said he. They shook hands round, asked questions. ‘You have wintered well,’ he said while, looked down. ‘Nothing much wrong you, seemingly.’ ‘They have put us boots,’ said Una. ‘Look feet--they are pale white, toes squidged together awfully.’ ‘Yes--boots make difference.’ Puck wriggled his brown, square, hairy foot, cropped dandelion flower big toe next. ‘I could that--last year,’ Dan said dismally, he tried failed. ‘And boots simply ruin one’s climbing.’ ‘There must advantage them, I suppose,’said Puck, folk would not wear them. Shall come way?’ They sauntered along side side till reached gate far end hillside. Here halted like cattle, let sun warm backs listened flies wood. ‘Little Lindens awake,’ said Una, she hung her chin top rail. ‘See chimney smoke?’ ‘Today’s Thursday, is not it?’ Puck turned look old pink farmhouse across little valley. ‘Mrs Vincey’s baking day. Bread rise well weather.’ He yawned, set yawning. The bracken rustled ticked shook every direction. They felt little crowds stealing past. ‘Does not sound like--er--the People Hills?’ said Una. ‘It is birds wild things drawing woods people get about,’ said Puck, though he Ridley keeper. ‘Oh, know that. I said sounded like.’ ‘As I remember ‘them, People Hills used make noise. They would settle day rather like small birds settling night. But days carried high hand. Oh, me! The deeds I have act part in, you would scarcely believe!’ ‘I like that!’ said Dan. ‘After told us last year, too!’ ‘Only, minute went away, made us forget everything,’ said Una. Puck laughed shook his head. ‘I shall year, too. I have given seizin Old England, I have taken away Doubt Fear, memory remembrance whiles I will keep old Billy Trott kept his night-lines--and that is he could draw ‘them hide ‘them need. Does suit?’ He twinkled mischievously. ‘It is got suit,’ said Una, laughed. ‘We Cannot magic back you.’ She folded her arms leaned gate. ‘Suppose, now, wanted magic something--an otter? Could you?’ ‘Not boots round neck.’ ‘I will take off.’ She threw turf. Dan’s followed immediately. ‘Now!’ she said. ‘Less ever you have trusted me. Where there is true faith, there is call magic.’ Puck’s slow smile broadened his face. ‘But boots it?’ said Una, perching gate. ‘There is Cold Iron them,’ said Puck, settled beside her. ‘Nails soles, I mean. It makes difference.’ ‘How?’ ‘Cannot feel does? You would not like go back bare feet again, last year, would you? Not really?’ ‘No-o. I suppose I should not--not always. I am growing up, know,’ said Una. ‘But told us last year, Long Slip--at theatre--that did not mind Cold Iron,’ said Dan. ‘I do not; folks housen, People Hills call them, must ruled Cold Iron. Folk housen born near side Cold Iron--there is iron ‘in every man’s house, is not there? They handle Cold Iron every day lives, fortune’s made spoilt Cold Iron shape other. That is goes Flesh Blood, one cannot prevent it.’ ‘I do not quite see. How mean?’ said Dan. ‘It would take time tell you.’ ‘Oh, it is ever long breakfast,’ said Dan. ‘We looked larder came out.’ He unpocketed one big hunk bread Una another, shared Puck. ‘That is Little Lindens’ baking,’ he said, his white teeth sunk it. ‘I know Mrs Vincey’s hand.’ He ate slow sideways thrust grind, like old Hobden, and, like Hobden, hardly dropped crumb. The sun flashed Little Lindens’ windows, cloudless sky grew stiller hotter valley. ‘AH--Cold Iron,’ he said last impatient children. ‘Folk housen, People Hills say, grow careless Cold Iron. They will nail Horseshoe front door, forget put back. Then, time other, People Hills slip in, find cradle-babe corner, and--’ ‘Oh, I know. Steal leave changeling,’ Una cried. ‘No,’ said Puck firmly. ‘All talk changelings people’s excuse neglect. Never believe ‘them. I would whip ‘them cart-tail three parishes I way.’ ‘But do not now,’ said Una. ‘Whip, neglect children? Umm! Some folks fields never alter. But People Hills did not work changeling tricks. They would tiptoe whisper weave round cradle-babe chimney-corner--a fag-end charm here, half spell there--like kettles singing; babe’s mind came bud afterwards, would act differently people station. That is advantage man maid. So I would not allow folks’ babies here. I told Sir Huon once.’ ‘Who Sir Huon?’ Dan asked, Puck turned quiet astonishment. ‘Sir Huon Bordeaux--he succeeded King Oberon. He bold knight once, he lost road Babylon, long back. Have ever heard “How many miles Babylon?”?’ ‘Of course,’ said Dan, flushing. ‘Well, Sir Huon young song new. But tricks mortal babies. I said Sir Huon fern here, morning this: “If crave act influence folk housen, I know desire, do not take human cradle-babe fair dealing, bring among far side Cold Iron--as Oberon time past? Then could make splendid fortune, send world.” ‘“Time past past time,” says Sir Huon. “I doubt could it. For one thing, babe would taken without wronging man, woman, child. For another, he would born far side Cold Iron--in house Cold Iron ever stood; yet third, he would kept Cold Iron his days till let find his fortune. No, it is easy,” he said, he rode off, thinking. You see, Sir Huon man once. ‘I happened attend Lewes Market next Woden’s Day even, watched slaves sold there--same pigs sold Robertsbridge Market nowadays. Only, pigs rings noses, slaves rings round necks.’ ‘What sort rings?’ said Dan. ‘A ring Cold Iron, four fingers wide, thumb thick, like quoit, snap snap round slave’s neck. They used big trade slave-rings Forge here, ship parts Old England, packed oak sawdust. But, I saying, farmer Weald bought woman babe her arms, he did not want encumbrances her driving his beasts home him.’ ‘Beast himself!’ said Una, kicked her bare heel gate. ‘So he blamed auctioneer. “It is none baby,” wench puts in. “I took woman gang died Terrible Down yesterday.” “I will take church then,” says farmer. “Mother Church’ll make monk it, we will step along home.” ‘It dusk then. He slipped St Pancras’ Church, laid babe cold chapel door. I breathed back his stooping neck--and--I have heard he never could warm fire afterwards. I surprised he could! Then I whipped babe, came flying home like bat his belfry. ‘On dewy break morning Thor’s day--just day this--I laid babe outside Hill here, People flocked wondered sight. ‘“You have brought him, then?” Sir Huon said, staring like mortal man. ‘“Yes, he is brought his mouth him, too,” I said. The babe crying loud his breakfast. ‘“What he?” says Sir Huon, womenfolk drawn feed him. ‘“Full Moon Morning Star may know,” I says. “I do not. By I could make moonlight, he is without brand blemish. I will answer he is born far side Cold Iron, he born shaw Terrible Down, I have wronged neither man, woman, child taking him, he son dead slave-woman.” ‘“All good, Robin,” Sir Huon said. “He will less anxious leave us. Oh, we will give splendid fortune, shall act influence folk housen always craved.” His Lady came then, drew watch babe’s wonderful doings.’ ‘Who his Lady?’ said Dan. ‘The Lady Esclairmonde. She woman once, till she followed Sir Huon across fern, say. Babies special treat me--I have watched many them--so I stayed Hill. Presently I heard hammering Forge there.’Puck pointed towards Hobden’s cottage. ‘It early workmen, passed mind breaking day Thor’s day. A slow north-east wind blew set oaks sawing fretting way I remembered; I slipped see I could see.’ ‘And see?’ ‘A smith forging something Cold Iron. When finished, he weighed his hand (his back towards me), tossed longish quoit-throw valley. I saw Cold Iron flash sun, I could not quite make fell. That did not trouble me. I knew would found sooner later someone.’ ‘How know?’ Dan went on. ‘Because I knew Smith made it,’ said Puck quietly. ‘Wayland Smith?’ Una suggested. [See ‘Weland’s Sword’ PUCK OF POOK’S HILL.] ‘No. I passed time day Wayland Smith, course. This different. So’--Puck made queer crescent air his finger--‘I counted blades grass nose till wind dropped he gone--he his Hammer.’ ‘Was Thor then?’ Una murmured her breath. ‘Who else? It Thor’s day.’ Puck repeated sign. ‘I did not tell Sir Huon his Lady I would seen. Borrow trouble that is nature, do not lend neighbours. Moreover, I might mistaken Smith’s work. He might making things mere amusement, though was not like him, he might thrown away old piece made iron. One never sure. So I held tongue enjoyed babe. He wonderful child--and People Hills set him, would not believed me. He took wonderfully. As soon he could walk he would putter forth Hill here. Fern makes soft falling! He knew day broke earth above, he would thump, thump, thump, like old buck-rabbit bury, I would hear say “Opy!” till one knew Charm let out, would “Robin! Robin!” round Robin Hood’s barn, say, till he would found me.’ ‘The dear!’ said Una. ‘I would like seen him!’ ‘Yes, he boy. And came learning his words--spells such-like--he would sit Hill long shadows, worrying bits charms try passersby. And bird flew him, tree bowed pure love’s sake (like everything else Hill), he would shout, “Robin! Look--see! Look, see, Robin!” sputter spell taught him, wrong end first, till I had not heart tell his dear self words worked wonder. When he got abreast his words, could cast spells sure, say, he took notice things people world. People, course, always drew him, he mortal through. ‘Seeing he free move among folk housen, Cold Iron, I used take along me, night-walking, he could watch folk, I could keep touching Cold Iron. That was not difficult sounds, plenty things besides Cold Iron housen catch boy’s fancy. He handful, though! I shall not forget I took Little Lindens--his first night roof. The smell rushlights bacon beams--they stuffing feather-bed too, drizzling warm night--got his head. Before I could stop him--we hiding bakehouse--he would whipped storm wildfire, flashlights voices, sent folk shrieking garden, girl overset hive there, and--of course he did not know till things could touch him--he got badly stung, came home his face looking like kidney potatoes! ‘You imagine angry Sir Huon Lady Esclairmonde poor Robin! They said Boy never trusted night-walking more--and he took much notice order he bee-stings. Night night, soon dark, I would pick his whistle wet fern, we would flit together among folk housen till break day--he asking questions, I answering according knowledge. Then fell mischief again!’ Puck shook till gate rattled. ‘We came across man Brightling beating his wife bat garden. I going toss man his woodlump Boy jumped hedge ran him. Of course woman took her husband’s part, man beat him, woman scratted his face. It was not till I danced among cabbages like Brightling Beacon ablaze gave ran indoors. The Boy’s fine green-and-gold clothes torn pieces, he welted twenty places man’s bat, scratted woman’s nails pieces. He looked like Robertsbridge hopper Monday morning. ‘“Robin,” said he, I trying clean bunch hay, “I do not quite understand folk housen. I went help old woman, she hit me, Robin!” ‘“What else expect?” I said. “That one time might worked one charms, instead running three times weight.” ‘“I did not think,” he says. “But I caught man one head good charm. Did see work, Robin?” ‘“Mind nose,” I said. “Bleed dockleaf--not sleeve, pity’s sake.” I knew Lady Esclairmonde would say. ‘He did not care. He happy gipsy stolen pony, front part his gold coat, blood grass stains, looked like ancient sacrifices. ‘Of course People Hills laid blame me. The Boy could nothing wrong, eyes. ‘“You bringing act influence folk housen, you are ready let go,” I said. “Now he is begun it, cry shame me? That is shame. It is his nature drawing his kind.” ‘“But do not want begin way,” Lady Esclairmonde said. “We intend splendid fortune him--not flitter-by-night, hedge-jumping, gipsy-work.” ‘“I do not blame you, Robin,” says Sir Huon, “but I think might look Boy closely.” ‘“I have kept away Cold Iron sixteen years,” I said. “You know well I do, first time he touches Cold Iron he will find his fortune, spite everything intend him. You owe something that.” ‘Sir Huon, man, going allow right it, Lady Esclairmonde, Mother Mothers, over-persuaded him. ‘“We are grateful,” Sir Huon said, “but think present much Hill.” ‘“Though said it,” I said, “I give second chance.” I like called account doings Hill. I would not stood even far except I loved Boy. ‘“No! No!” says Lady Esclairmonde. “He is never trouble he is left himself. It is fault.” ‘“You said it,” I answered. “Hear me! From till Boy found his fortune, whatever may be, I vow Hill, Oak, Ash, Thorn, Hammer Asa Thor”--again Puck made curious double-cut air--‘“that may leave counts reckonings.” Then I went out’--he snapped his fingers--‘like puff candle, though called cried, made nothing it. I did not promise keep eye Boy, though. I watched close--close--close! ‘When he found his people forced do, he gave piece his mind, kissed cried round him, boy, he came way thinking (I do not blame him), called unkind ungrateful; ended fresh shows plays, magics distract folk housen. Dear heart alive! How he used call call me, I could not answer, even let know I near!’ ‘Not even once?’ said Una. ‘If he lonely?’ ‘No, he could not,’ said Dan, thinking. ‘Did not swear Hammer Thor would not, Puck?’ ‘By Hammer!’ deep rumbled reply. Then he came back his soft speaking voice. ‘And Boy lonely, he could not see more. He began try learn learning (he good teachers), I saw lift his eyes big black books towards folk housen time. He studied song-making (good teachers he too!), he sang songs his back toward Hill, his face toward folk. I know! I sat grieved grieving within rabbit’s jump him. Then he studied High, Low, Middle Magic. He promised Lady Esclairmonde he would never go near folk housen; he make shows shadows his mind chew on.’ ‘What sort shows?’ said Dan. ‘Just boy’s Magic say. I will show some, time. It pleased while, did not hurt one particular except men coming home late taverns. But I knew sign of, I followed like weasel follows rabbit. As good boy ever lived! I have seen Sir Huon Lady Esclairmonde stepping stepped avoid track Cold Iron furrow, walking wide old ash-tot man left his swop-hook spade there; his heart aching go straightforward among folk housen time. Oh, good boy! They always intended fine fortune him--but could never find heart let begin. I have heard many warned them, would not warned. So happened happened. ‘One hot night I saw Boy roving wrapped his flaming discontents. There flash flash clouds, rush rush shadows valley till shaws full his hounds giving tongue, woodways packed his knights armour riding water-mists--all his Magic, course. Behind could see great castles lifting slow splendid arches moonshine, maidens waving hands windows, turned roaring rivers; would come darkness his young heart wiping whole slateful. But boy’s Magic does not trouble me--or Merlin’s either matter. I followed Boy flashes whirling wildfire his discontent, oh, I grieved him! Oh, I grieved him! He pounded back forth like bullock strange pasture--sometimes alone--sometimes waist-deep among his shadow-hounds--sometimes leading his shadow-knights hawk-winged horse rescue his shadow-girls. I never guessed he Magic his command; it is often way boys. ‘Just owl comes home second time, I saw Sir Huon Lady ride Hill, there is much Magic allowed except mine. They pleased Boy’s Magic--the valley flared it--and I heard settling his splendid fortune find hearts let go act influence among folk housen. Sir Huon making great King somewhere other, Lady making marvellous wise man praise his skill kindness. She kind-hearted. ‘Of sudden saw flashes his discontents turned back clouds, his shadow-hounds stopped baying. ‘“There is Magic fighting Magic yonder,” Lady Esclairmonde cried, reigning up. “Who him?” ‘I could told her, I count business speak Asa Thor’s comings goings. ‘How know?’ said Una. ‘A slow North-East wind blew up, sawing fretting oaks way I remembered. The wildfire roared up, one last time one sheet, snuffed like rushlight, bucketful stinging hail fell. We heard Boy walking Long Slip--where I first met you. ‘“Here, oh, come here!” said Lady Esclairmonde, stretched her arms dark. ‘He coming slowly, he stumbled footpath, being, course, mortal man. ‘“Why, what is this?” he said himself. We three heard him. ‘“Hold, lad, hold! ‘Ware Cold Iron!” said Sir Huon, two swept like nightjars, crying rode. ‘I ran stirrups, late. We felt Boy touched Cold Iron somewhere dark, Horses Hill shied off, whipped round, snorting. ‘Then I judged time show shape; I did. ‘“Whatever is,” I said, “he taken hold it. Now must find whatever he taken hold of, his fortune.” ‘“Come here, Robin,” Boy shouted, soon he heard voice. “I do not know I have hold of.” ‘“It hands,” I called back. “Tell us hard cold, jewels atop. For King’s Sceptre.” ‘“Not furrow-long,” he said, stooped tugged dark. We heard him. ‘“Has handle two cutting edges?” I called. “For that will Knight’s Sword.” ‘“No, has not,” he says. “It is neither ploughshare, whittle, hook, crook, aught I have yet seen men handle.” By time he scratting dirt prise up. ‘“Whatever is, know put there, Robin,” said Sir Huon me, “or would ask questions. You told soon knew.” ‘“What could I done Smith made laid find?” I said, I whispered Sir Huon I seen Forge Thor’s Day, babe first brought Hill. ‘“Oh, good-bye, dreams!” said Sir Huon. “It is neither sceptre, sword, plough! Maybe yet it is bookful learning, bound iron clasps. There is chance splendid fortune sometimes.” ‘But knew speaking comfort ourselves, Lady Esclairmonde, woman, said so. ‘“Thur aie! Thor help us!” Boy called. “It round, without end, Cold Iron, four fingers wide thumb thick, writing breadth it.” ‘“Read writing learning,” I called. The darkness lifted then, owl fern again. ‘He called back, reading runes iron: “Few see Further forth Than child Meets Cold Iron.” And he stood, clear starlight, new, heavy, shining slave-ring round his proud neck. ‘“Is goes?” he asked, Lady Esclairmonde cried. ‘“That goes,” I said. He had not snapped catch home yet, though. ‘“What fortune mean him?” said Sir Huon, Boy fingered ring. “You walk Cold Iron, must tell us teach us.” ‘“Tell I can, teach I cannot,” I said. “The virtue Ring he must go among folk housen henceforward, want done, he knows need, Old England over. Never he his master, yet ever man’s. He get half he gives, give twice he gets, till his life’s last breath; he lays aside his load he draws last breath, his work go naught.” ‘“Oh, cruel, wicked Thor!” cried Lady Esclairmonde. “Ah, look see, you! The catch still open! He has not locked it. He still take off. He still come back. Come back!” She went near she dared, she could lay hands Cold Iron. The Boy could taken off, yes. We waited see he would, he put his hand, snap locked home. ‘“What else could I done?” said he. ‘“Surely, then, do,” I said. “Morning’s coming, three farewells make, make now, for, sunrise, Cold Iron must master.” ‘So three sat down, cheek wet cheek, telling farewells till morning light. As good boy ever lived, he was.’ ‘And happened him?’ asked Dan. ‘When morning came, Cold Iron master his fortune, he went work among folk housen. Presently he came across maid like-minded himself, wedded, bushels children, saying is. Perhaps you will meet his breed, year.’ ‘Thank you,’ said Una. ‘But poor Lady Esclairmonde do?’ ‘What Asa Thor lays Cold Iron lad’s path? She Sir Huon comforted think given Boy good store learning act influence folk housen. For he good boy! Is not getting breakfast-time? I will walk piece.’ When well centre bone-dry fern, Dan nudged Una, stopped put boot quickly she could. ‘Now,’ she said, ‘you cannot get Oak, Ash, Thorn leaves here, and’--she balanced wildly one leg--‘I am standing Cold Iron. What will do not go away?’ ‘E-eh? Of mortal impudence!’ said Puck, Dan, also one boot, grabbed his sister’s hand steady himself. He walked round them, shaking delight. ‘You think I work handful dead leaves? This comes taking away Doubt Fear! I will show you!’ A minute later charged old Hobden his simple breakfast cold roast pheasant, shouting wasps’ nest fern nearly stepped on, asking come smoke out. ‘It is early wops-nests, an’ I do not go diggin’ Hill, shillin’s,’ said old man placidly. ‘You have thorn foot, Miss Una. Sit down, put t’other boot. You are old caperin’ barefoot empty stomach. Stay chicken mine.’ Cold Iron ‘Gold mistress--silver maid! Copper craftsman cunning his trade.’ ‘Good!’ said Baron, sitting his hall, ‘But Iron--Cold Iron--is master all!’ So he made rebellion ‘gainst King his liege, Camped his citadel summoned siege-- ‘Nay!’ said cannoneer castle wall, ‘But Iron--Cold Iron--shall master all!’ Woe Baron his knights strong, When cruel cannon-balls laid ‘them along! He taken prisoner, he cast thrall, And Iron--Cold Iron--was master all! Yet his King spake kindly (Oh, kind Lord!) ‘What I release thee give thee back thy sword?’ ‘Nay!’ said Baron, ‘mock fall, For Iron--Cold Iron--is master men all.’ ‘Tears craven, prayers clown-- Halters silly neck cannot keep crown.’ ‘As loss grievous, hope small, For Iron--Cold Iron--must master men all!’ Yet his King made answer (few Kings be!) ‘Here Bread Wine--sit sup me. Eat drink Mary’s Name, whiles I recall How Iron--Cold Iron--can master men all!’ He took Wine blessed It; He blessed brake Bread. With His Hands He served Them, presently He said: ‘Look! These Hands pierced nails outside city wall Show Iron--Cold Iron--to master men all! ‘Wounds desperate, blows strong, Balm oil weary hearts cut bruised wrong. I forgive thy treason--I redeem thy fall-- For Iron--Cold Iron--must master men all!’ ‘Crowns valiant--sceptres bold! Thrones powers mighty men dare take hold.’ ‘Nay!’ said Baron, kneeling his hall, ‘But Iron--Cold Iron--is master men all! Iron, Calvary, master men all!’ GLORIANA The Two Cousins Valour Innocence Have latterly gone hence To certain death certain shame attended. Envy--ah! even tears!-- The fortune years Which, though few, yet divinely ended. Scarce lifted Life’s full fiery cup, Than set untouched them. Before day arose They beckoned close-- Close destruction confusion them. They stay ask What prize crown task, Well sure prize man strives for; But passed eclipse, Her kiss upon lips-- Even Belphoebe’s, gave lives for! Gloriana Willow Shaw, little fenced wood hop-poles stacked like Indian wigwams, given Dan Una kingdom quite small. As grew older, contrived keep particularly private. Even Phillips, gardener, told every time he came take hop-pole his beans, old Hobden would thought setting his rabbit-wires without leave, given fresh spring, he would torn calico marking ink notice big willow said: ‘Grown-ups allowed Kingdom unless brought.’ Now understand indignation when, one blowy July afternoon, going potato-roast, saw somebody moving among trees. They hurled gate, dropping half potatoes, picking Puck came wigwam. ‘Oh, it is you, it?’ said Una. ‘We thought people.’ ‘I saw angry--from legs,’ he answered grin. ‘Well, it is Kingdom--not counting you, course.’ ‘That is rather I came. A lady wants see you.’ ‘What about?’ said Dan cautiously. ‘Oh, Kingdoms things. She knows Kingdoms.’ There lady near fence dressed long dark cloak hid everything except her high red-heeled shoes. Her face half covered black silk fringed mask, without goggles. And yet she look least she motored. Puck led her bowed solemnly. Una made best dancing-lesson curtsy she could remember. The lady answered long, deep, slow, billowy one. ‘Since seems Queen Kingdom,’ she said, ‘I less acknowledge sovereignty.’ She turned sharply staring Dan. ‘What is head, lad? Manners?’ ‘I thinking wonderfully curtsy,’ he answered. She laughed rather shrill laugh. ‘You are courtier already. Do know anything dances, wench--or Queen, must I say?’ ‘I have lessons, I cannot really dance bit,’ said Una. ‘You learn, then.’ The lady moved forward though she would teach her once. ‘It gives woman alone among men her enemies time think she shall win or--lose. A woman work man’s play-time. Heigho!’ She sat bank. Old Middenboro, lawn-mower pony, stumped across paddock hung his sorrowful head fence. ‘A pleasant Kingdom,’ said lady, looking round. ‘Well enclosed. And Majesty govern it? Who Minister?’ Una quite understand. ‘We do not play that,’ she said. ‘Play?’ The lady threw her hands laughed. ‘We own, together,’ Dan explained. ‘And d’you never quarrel, young Burleigh?’ ‘Sometimes, do not tell.’ The lady nodded. ‘I have brats own, I understand keeping secret Queens Ministers. Ay de mi! But disrespect present majesty, methinks realm’ small, therefore likely coveted man beast. For Is example’--she pointed Middenboro--‘yonder old horse, face Spanish friar--does he never break in?’ ‘He cannot. Old Hobden stops gaps us,’ said Una, ‘and let Hobden catch rabbits Shaw.’ The lady laughed like man. ‘I see! Hobden catches conies--rabbits--for himself, guards defences you. Does he make profit his coney-catching?’ ‘We never ask,’ said Una. ‘Hobden’s particular friend ours.’ ‘Hoity-toity!’ lady began angrily. Then she laughed. ‘But I forget. It Kingdom. I knew maid larger one defend, long her men kept fences stopped, she asked ‘them questions either.’ ‘Was she trying grow flowers?’ said Una. ‘No, trees--perdurable trees. Her flowers withered.’ The lady leaned her head her hand. ‘They do not look them. We have got few. Would like see? I will fetch some.’ Una ran rank grass shade behind wigwam, came back handful red flowers. ‘Are not pretty?’ she said. ‘They are Virginia stock.’ ‘Virginia?’ said lady, lifted fringe her mask. ‘Yes. They come Virginia. Did maid ever plant any?’ ‘Not herself--but her men adventured earth pluck plant flowers her crown. They judged her worthy them.’ ‘And she?’ said Dan cheerfully. ‘Quien sabe? [who knows?] But least, her men toiled abroad she toiled England, might find safe home come back to.’ ‘And she called?’ ‘Gloriana--Belphoebe--Elizabeth England.’ Her voice changed word. ‘You mean Queen Bess?’ The lady bowed her head little towards Dan. ‘You name her lightly enough, young Burleigh. What might know her?’ said she. ‘Well, I--I have seen little green shoes she left Brickwall House--down road, know. They are glass case--awfully tiny things.’ ‘Oh, Burleigh, Burleigh!’ she laughed. ‘You courtier soon.’ ‘But are,’ Dan insisted. ‘As little dolls’ shoes. Did really know her well?’ ‘Well. She a--woman. I have her Court life. Yes, I remember she danced banquet Brickwall. They say she danced Philip Spain brand-new kingdom day. Worth price pair old shoes--hey?’ She thrust one foot, stooped forward look broad flashing buckle. ‘You have heard Philip Spain--long-suffering Philip,’ she said, her eyes still shining stones. ‘Faith, men endure women’s hands passes belief! If I man, woman played Elizabeth played Philip, I would have--’ She nipped one Virginia stocks held finger thumb. ‘But that’--she began strip leaves one one--‘they say--and I persuaded--that Philip loved her.’ She tossed her head sideways. ‘I do not quite understand,’ said Una. ‘The high heavens forbid should, wench!’ She swept flowers her lap stood rush shadows wind chased wood. ‘I like know shoes,’ said Dan. ‘So ye shall, Burleigh. So ye shall, ye watch me. ‘Twill good play.’ ‘We have never play,’ said Una. The lady looked her laughed. ‘I will make one you. Watch! You imagine she--Gloriana, Belphoebe, Elizabeth--has gone progress Rye comfort her sad heart (maids often melancholic), she halts Brickwall House, village--what name?’ She pushed Puck her foot. ‘Norgem,’ he croaked, squatted wigwam. ‘Norgem village loyally entertains her masque play, Latin oration spoken parson, whose false quantities, I would made ‘them girlhood, I whipped.’ ‘You whipped?’ said Dan. ‘Soundly, sirrah, soundly! She stomachs affront her scholarship, makes her grateful, gracious thanks teeth outwards, thus’--(the lady yawned)--‘Oh, Queen may love her subjects her heart, yet dog-wearied ‘them ‘in body mind--and sits down’--her skirts foamed her she sat--‘to banquet beneath Brickwall Oak. Here her sins she waited upon by--What young cockerels’ names served Gloriana table?’ ‘Frewens, Courthopes, Fullers, Husseys,’ Puck began. She held her long jewelled hand. ‘Spare rest! They best blood Sussex, much clumsy handling dishes plates. Wherefore’--she looked funnily her shoulder--‘you think Gloriana green gold-laced habit, dreadfully expecting jostling youths behind her would, pure jealousy devotion, spatter sauces wines. The gown Philip’s gift, too! At happy juncture Queen’s messenger, mounted mired, spurs Rye road delivers her letter’--she giggled--‘a letter good, simple, frantic Spanish gentleman called--Don Philip.’ ‘That was not Philip, King Spain?’ Dan asked. ‘Truly, was. ‘Twixt bedpost, young Burleigh, kings queens like men women, I have heard write fond, foolish letters none ministers open.’ ‘Did her ministers ever open Queen Elizabeth’s letters?’ said Una. ‘Faith, yes! But she would done much theirs, day. You think Gloriana, (they say she pretty hand), excusing herself thus company--for Queen’s time never her own--and, music strikes up, reading Philip’s letter, I do.’ She drew real letter her pocket, held almost arm’s length, like old post-mistress village she reads telegrams. ‘Hm! Hm! Hm! Philip writes ever lovingly. He says his Gloriana cold, reason he burns her fair written page.’ She turned snap. ‘What is here? Philip complains certain her gentlemen fought his generals Low Countries. He prays her hang ‘them re-enter her realms. (Hm, that is may be.) Here is list burnt shipping slipped two vows burning adoration. Oh, poor Philip! His admirals sea--no less three ‘them--have boarded, sacked, scuttled lawful voyages certain English mariners (gentlemen, he call them), large working piracies his American ocean, Pope gave him. (He Pope guard it, then!) Philip hears, his devout ears credit it, Gloriana fashion countenances villains’ misdeeds, shares booty, and--oh, shame!---has even lent ships royal sinful thefts. Therefore he requires (which word Gloriana loves not), requires she shall hang ‘them return England, afterwards shall account goods gold plundered. A loving request! If Gloriana Philip’s bride, she shall his broker his butcher! Should she still stiff-necked, he writes--see pen digged innocent paper!---that he hath means intention revenged her. Aha! Now come Spaniard his shirt!’ (She waved letter merrily.) ‘Listen here! Philip prepare Gloriana destruction West--a destruction West--far exceeding Pedro de Avila wrought upon Huguenots. And he rests remains, kissing her feet her hands, her slave, her enemy, her conqueror, he shall find she uses him.’ She thrust back letter her cloak, went acting, softer voice. ‘All while--hark it--the wind blows Brickwall Oak, music plays, and, company’s eyes upon her, Queen England must think means. She cannot remember name Pedro de Avila, he Huguenots, when, where. She see darkly dark motion moving Philip’s dark mind, he hath never written fashion. She must smile letter though good news her ministers--the smile tires mouth poor heart. What shall she do?’ Again her voice changed. ‘You fancy music sudden wavers away. Chris Hatton, Captain her bodyguard, quits table red ruffled, Gloriana’s virgin ear catches clash swords work behind wall. The mothers Sussex look round count chicks--I mean young gamecocks waited her. Two dainty youths stepped aside Brickwall garden rapier dagger private point honour. They haled gate, disarmed glaring--the lively image brace young Cupids transformed pale, panting Cains. Ahem! Gloriana beckons awfully--thus! They come judgement. Their lives estates lie her mercy doubly offended, Queen woman. But la! foolish young men beautiful maid?’ ‘Why? What she do? What done?’ said Una. ‘Hsh! You mar play! Gloriana guessed trouble. They handsome lads. So she frowns tells ‘them bigger fools mothers made ‘them, warns ‘them, kiss friends instant, she will Chris Hatton horse birch ‘them style new school Harrow. (Chris looks sour that.) Lastly, she needed time think Philip’s letter burning her pocket, she signifies her pleasure dance ‘them teach ‘them better manners. Whereat revived company call Heaven’s blessing her gracious head; Chris others prepare Brickwall House dance; she walks clipped garden two lovely young sinners ready sink shame. They confess fault. It appears midway banquet elder--they cousins--conceived Queen looked upon special favour. The younger, taking look himself, words gives elder lie. Hence, she guessed, duel.’ ‘And she really looked at?’ Dan asked. ‘Neither--except wish farther off. She afraid they would spill dishes her gown. She tells ‘them this, poor chicks--and completes abasement. When grilled long enough, she says: “And would fleshed maiden swords me--for me?” Faith, would she would egged ‘them on! swords--oh, prettily said it!---had drawn her twice already. ‘“And where?” says she. “On hobby-horses breeched?” ‘“On ship,” says elder. “My cousin vice-admiral venture his pinnace. We would think us brawling children.” ‘“No, no,” says younger, flames like Tudor rose. “At least Spaniards know us better.” ‘“Admiral Boy--Vice-Admiral Babe,” says Gloriana, “I cry pardon. The heat present times ripens childhood age quickly I follow. But peace Spain. Where break Queen’s peace?” ‘“On sea called Spanish Main, though ‘it is Spanish doublet,” says elder. Guess warmed Gloriana’s already melting heart! She would never suffer sea called Spanish her private hearing. ‘“And I told? What booty got you, hid it? Disclose,” says she. “You stand danger gallows pirates.” ‘“The axe, gracious lady,” says elder, “for gentle born.” He spoke truth, woman brook contradiction. “Hoity-toity!” says she, and, she remembered she Queen, she would cuffed pair ‘them. “It shall gallows, hurdle, dung-cart I choose.” ‘“Had Queen known going beforehand, Philip might held her blame small things seas,” younger lisps. ‘“As treasure,” says elder, “we brought back bare lives. We wrecked Gascons’ Graveyard, sole company three months bleached bones De Avila’s men.” ‘Gloriana’s mind jumped back Philip’s last letter. ‘“De Avila destroyed Huguenots? What d’you know him?” she says. The music called house here, three turned back yews. ‘“Simply De Avila broke upon plantation Frenchmen coast, Spaniardly hung heretics--eight hundred so. The next year Dominique de Gorgues, Gascon, broke upon De Avila’s men, justly hung ‘them murderers--five hundred so. No Christians inhabit now, says elder lad, though ‘it is goodly land north Florida.” ‘“How far England?” asks prudent Gloriana. ‘“With fair wind, six weeks. They say Philip plant soon.” This younger, he looked her corner his innocent eye. ‘Chris Hatton, fuming, meets leads her Brickwall Hall, she dances--thus. A woman think she dances--can think. I will show you. Watch!’ She took her cloak slowly, stood forth dove-coloured satin, worked pearls trembled like running water running shadows trees. Still talking--more herself children--she swam majestical dance stateliest balancings, naughtiest wheelings turnings aside, dignified sinkings, gravest risings, joined together elaboratest interlacing steps circles. They leaned forward breathlessly watch splendid acting. ‘Would Spaniard,’ she began, looking ground, ‘speak his revenge till his revenge ripe? No. Yet man loved woman might threaten her ‘in hope his threats would make her love him. Such things been.’ She moved slowly across bar sunlight. ‘A destruction West may signify Philip means descend Ireland. But Irish spies would warning. The Irish keep secrets. No--it Ireland. Now why--why--why’--the red shoes clicked paused--‘does Philip name Pedro Melendez de Avila, general his Americas, unless’--she turned quickly--unless he intends work his destruction Americas? Did he say De Avila put her her guard, his black pen betrayed his black heart? We’--she raised herself her full height--‘England must forestall Master Philip. But openly,’--she sank again--‘we cannot fight Spain openly--not yet--not yet.’ She stepped three paces though she pegging snare her twinkling shoe-buckles. ‘The Queen’s mad gentlemen may fight Philip’s poor admirals find ‘them, England, Gloriana, Harry’s daughter, must keep peace. Perhaps, all, Philip loves her--as many men boys do. That may help England. Oh, shall help England?’ She raised her head--the masked head seemed nothing busy feet--and stared straight children. ‘I think rather creepy,’ said Una shiver. ‘I wish she would stop.’ The lady held her jewelled hand though she taking one else’s hand Grand Chain. ‘Can ship go Gascons’ Graveyard wait there?’ she asked air, passed rustling. ‘She is pretending ask one cousins, is not she?’ said Dan, Puck nodded. Back she came silent, swaying, ghostly dance. They saw she smiling beneath mask, could hear her breathing hard. ‘I cannot lend ships venture; Philip would hear it,’ she whispered her shoulder; ‘but much guns powder ask, ask too--‘Her voice shot she stamped her foot thrice. ‘Louder! Louder, music gallery! Oh, me, I burst shoe!’ She gathered her skirts hand, began curtsy. ‘You go charges,’ she whispered straight her. ‘Oh, enviable adorable age youth!’ Her eyes shone mask-holes. ‘But I warn you will repent it. Put trust princes--or Queens. Philip’s ships’ll blow water. You will frightened? Well, we will talk again, I return Rye, dear lads.’ The wonderful curtsy ended. She stood up. Nothing stirred her except rush shadows. ‘And finished,’ she said children. ‘Why d’you applaud?’ ‘What finished?’ said Una. ‘The dance,’ lady replied offendedly. ‘And pair green shoes.’ ‘I do not understand bit,’ said Una. ‘Eh? What make it, young Burleigh?’ ‘I am quite sure,’ Dan began, ‘but--’ ‘You never be--with woman. But--?’ ‘But I thought Gloriana meant cousins go back Gascons’ Graveyard, wherever was.’ ‘It Was Virginia after-wards. Her plantation Virginia.’ ‘Virginia afterwards, stop Philip taking it. Did not she say she would lend ‘them guns?’ ‘Right so. But ships--then.’ ‘And I thought meant must told her they would bat, without getting her row Philip. Was I right?’ ‘Near enough Minister Queen. But remember she gave lads full time change minds. She three long days Rye Royal--knighting fat Mayors. When she came back Brickwall, met her mile road, she could feel eyes burn her riding-mask. Chris Hatton, poor fool, vexed it. ‘“YOU would birch I gave chance,” says she Chris. “Now must get half hour’s private speech ‘them Brickwall garden. Eve tempted Adam garden. Quick, man, I may repent!”’ ‘She Queen. Why she send herself?’ said Una. The lady shook her head. ‘That never her way. I have seen her walk her mirror bye-ends, woman cannot walk straight past praying for. Yet I would pray her! What else--what else England’s name could she done?’ She lifted her hand her throat moment. ‘Faith,’ she cried, ‘I would forgotten little green shoes! She left ‘them Brickwall--so she did. And I remember she gave Norgem parson--John Withers, he?---a text his sermon--“Over Edom I cast shoe.” Neat, he would understood!’ ‘I do not understand,’ said Una. ‘What two cousins?’ ‘You cruel woman,’ lady answered. ‘I blame. I told I gave ‘them time change minds. On honour (ay de mi!), she asked ‘them first wait coast--the Gascons’ Graveyard--to hover little ships chanced pass way--they one tall ship pinnace--only watch bring word Philip’s doings. One must watch Philip always. What murrain right he make plantation there, hundred leagues north his Spanish Main, six weeks England? By dread father’s soul, I tell he none--none!’ She stamped her red foot again, two children shrunk back second. ‘Nay, nay. You must turn too! She laid fairly lads Brickwall garden yews. I told ‘them Philip sent fleet (and make plantation he could well send less), poor little cock-boats could sink it. They answered that, submission, fight would concern. She showed ‘them could one end it--quick death sea, slow death Philip’s prisons. They asked embrace death sake. Many men prayed life. I have refused ‘them, slept none worse after; men, tall, fantastical young men, beseech knees leave die me, shakes me--ah, shakes marrow old bones.’ Her chest sounded like board she hit it. ‘She showed ‘them all. I told ‘them time open war Spain. If miracle inconceivable prevailed Philip’s fleet, Philip would hold accountable. For England’s sake, save war, I e’en forced (I told ‘them so) give young lives. If failed, miracle escaped Philip’s hand, crept back England bare lives, must lie--oh, I told ‘them all--under sovereign displeasure. She could know them, see them, hear names, stretch finger save gallows, Philip chose ask it. ‘“Be gallows, then,” says elder. (I could wept, face made day.) ‘“Either way--any way--this venture death, I know fear not. But death assured dishonour,” I cried. ‘“Yet Queen know her heart done,” says younger. ‘“Sweetheart,” I said. “A queen heart.” ‘“But she woman, woman would forget,” says elder. “We go!” They knelt feet. ‘“Nay, dear lads--but here!” I said, I opened arms I kissed them. ‘“Be ruled me,” I said. “We will hire ill-featured old tarry-breeks admiral watch Graveyard, shall come Court.” ‘“Hire please,” says elder; “we ruled you, body soul”; younger, shook I kissed ‘them, says his white lips, “I think power make god man.” ‘“Come Court sure of’t,” I said. ‘They shook heads I knew--I knew, go would. If I kissed them--perhaps I might prevailed.’ ‘Then it?’ said Una. ‘I do not think knew really wanted done.’ ‘May please Majesty’--the lady bowed her head low--‘this Gloriana I represented pleasure woman Queen. Remember her come Kingdom.’ ‘But--did cousins go Gascons’ Graveyard?’ said Dan, Una frowned. ‘They went,’ said lady. ‘Did ever come back?’ Una began; but--‘Did stop King Philip’s fleet?’ Dan interrupted. The lady turned eagerly. ‘D’you think right go?’ she asked. ‘I do not see else could done,’ Dan replied, thinking over. ‘D’you think she right send ‘them?’ The lady’s voice rose little. ‘Well,’ said Dan, ‘I do not see else she could done, either--do you? How stop King Philip getting Virginia?’ ‘There is sad part it. They sailed autumn Rye Royal, never came back much single rope-yarn show befallen them. The winds blew, not. Does make alter mind, young Burleigh?’ ‘I expect drowned, then. Anyhow, Philip did not score, he?’ ‘Gloriana wiped her score Philip later. But Philip won, would blamed Gloriana wasting lads’ lives?’ ‘Of course not. She bound try stop him.’ The lady coughed. ‘You root matter you. Were I Queen, I would make Minister.’ ‘We do not play game,’ said Una, felt she disliked lady much she disliked noise high wind made tearing Willow Shaw. ‘Play!’ said lady laugh, threw her hands affectedly. The sunshine caught jewels her many rings made flash till Una’s eyes dazzled, she rub them. Then she saw Dan his knees picking potatoes spilled gate. ‘There was not anybody Shaw, all,’ he said. ‘Did not think saw someone?’ ‘I am awfully glad is not,’ said Una. Then went potato-roast. The Looking-Glass Queen Bess Was Harry’s daughter! The Queen her chamber, she middling old, Her petticoat satin her stomacher gold. Backwards forwards sideways she pass, Making her mind face cruel looking-glass. The cruel looking-glass never show lass As comely kindly young she was! The Queen her chamber, a-combing her hair, There came Queen Mary’s spirit stood behind her chair, Singing, ‘Backwards forwards sideways may pass, But I stand behind till face looking-glass. The cruel looking-glass never show lass As lovely unlucky lonely I was!’ The Queen her chamber, a-weeping sore, There came Lord Leicester’s spirit scratched upon door, Singing, ‘Backwards forwards sideways may pass, But I walk beside till face looking-glass. The cruel looking-glass never show lass As hard unforgiving wicked was!’ The Queen her chamber; her sins her head; She looked spirits statelily she said: ‘Backwards forwards sideways though I have been, Yet I Harry’s daughter I England’s Queen!’ And she faced looking-glass (and whatever else was), And she saw her day she saw her beauty pass In cruel looking-glass always hurt lass More hard ghost man was! THE WRONG THING A Truthful Song THE BRICKLAYER: I tell tale, strictly true, way convincing How little since things made Things altered building trade. A year ago, come middle March, We building flats near Marble Arch, When thin young man coal-black hair Came watch us working there. Now was not trick brick stone That young man had not seen known; Nor was not tool trowel maul But young man could use ‘them all! Then spoke plumbyers bold, Which laying pipes hot cold: ‘Since us made free, Will kindly say name might be?’ The young man kindly answered them: ‘It might Lot Methusalem, Or might Moses (a man I hate), Whereas Pharaoh surnamed Great. ‘Your glazing new plumbing’s strange, But other-wise I perceive change, And less month, I bid, I would learn build Pyramid.’ THE SAILOR: I tell tale, stricter true, way convincing How little since things made Things altered shipwright’s trade. In Blackwall Basin yesterday A China barque re-fitting lay, When fat old man snow-white hair Came watch us working there. Now was not knot riggers knew But old man made it--and better too; Nor was not sheet, lift, brace, But old man knew lead place. Then spake caulkyers bold, Which packing pump after-hold: ‘Since us made free, Will kindly tell name might be?’ The old man kindly answered them: ‘it might Japhet, might Shem, Or might Ham (though his skin dark), Whereas Noah, commanding Ark. ‘Your wheel new pumps strange, But otherwise I perceive change, And less week, she ground, I would sail hooker wide world round!’ BOTH: We tell tales, strictest true, etc. The Wrong Thing Dan gone building model boats; he filled schoolroom chips, he expected Una clear away, turned doors he took his tools hill Mr Springett’s yard, he knew he could make much mess he chose. Old Mr Springett builder, contractor, sanitary engineer, his yard, opened village street, always full interesting things. At one end long loft, reached ladder, he kept his iron-bound scaffold-planks, tins paints, pulleys, odds ends he found old houses. He would sit hour watching his carts loaded unloaded yard below, Dan gouged grunted carpenter’s bench near loft window. Mr Springett Dan always particular friends, Mr Springett old he could remember railways made southern counties England, people allowed drive dogs carts. One hot, still afternoon--the tar-paper roof smelt like ships--Dan, his shirt-sleeves, smoothing new schooner’s bow, Mr Springett talking barns houses he built. He said he never forgot stick stone he ever handled, man, woman, child he ever met. Just he proud Village Hall entrance village, he finished weeks before. ‘An’ I do not mind tellin’ you, Mus’ Dan,’ he said, ‘that Hall last job top mortal earth. I did not make ten pounds--no, yet five--out whole contrac’, name’s lettered foundation stone--Ralph Springett, Builder--and stone she is bedded four foot good concrete. If she shifts time five hundred years, I will sure-ly turn grave. I told Lunnon architec’ he come oversee work.’ ‘What he say?’ Dan sandpapering schooner’s port bow. ‘Nothing. The Hall are not one his small jobs him, ‘tain’t small me, an’ name cut lettered, frontin’ village street, I hope an’ pray, time everlastin’. You will want little round file holler her bow. Who is there?’ Mr Springett turned stiffly his chair. A long pile scaffold-planks ran centre loft. Dan looked, saw Hal Draft’s touzled head beyond them. [See ‘Hal Draft’ PUCK OF POOK’S HILL.] ‘Be builder Village Hall?’ he asked Mr Springett. ‘I be,’ answer. ‘But want job--’ Hal laughed. ‘No, faith!’ he said. ‘Only Hall good honest piece work I have ever run rule over. So, born hereabouts, reckoned master among masons, accepted master mason, I made bold pay brotherly respects builder.’ ‘Aa--um!’ Mr Springett looked important. ‘I bit rusty, I will try ye!’ He asked Hal several curious questions, answers must pleased him, he invited Hal sit down. Hal moved up, always keeping behind pile planks his head showed, sat trestle dark corner back Mr Springett’s desk. He took notice Dan, talked Mr Springett bricks, cement, lead glass, Dan went his work. He knew Mr Springett pleased, he tugged his white sandy beard, smoked his pipe short puffs. The two men seemed agree everything, grown-ups agree interrupt almost much quarrelling. Hal said something workmen. ‘Why, that is I always say,’ Mr Springett cried. ‘A man one thing, he is next-above-fool man cannot nothing. That is Unions make mistake.’ ‘My thought dot.’ Dan heard Hal slap his tight-hosed leg. ‘I have suffered ‘in time Guilds--Unions, d’you call ‘them? All precious talk mysteries trades--why, come to?’ ‘Nothing! You have justabout hit it,’ said Mr Springett, rammed his hot tobacco his thumb. ‘Take art wood-carving,’ Hal went on. He reached across planks, grabbed wooden mallet, moved his hand though he wanted something. Mr Springett without word passed one Dan’s broad chisels. ‘Ah! Wood-carving, example. If cut wood fair draft ye mean do, a’ Heaven’s name take chisel maul let drive it, say I! You will soon find mystery, forsooth, wood-carving proper hand!’ Whack, came mallet chisel, sliver wood curled front it. Mr Springett watched like old raven. ‘All art one, man--one!’ said Hal whacks; ‘and wait another man finish out--’ ‘To finish work are not sense,’ Mr Springett cut in. ‘That is I am always sayin’ boy here.’ He nodded towards Dan. ‘That is I said I put new wheel Brewster’s Mill Eighteen hundred Seventy-two. I reckoned I millwright enough job ‘thout bringin’ man Lunnon. An’ besides, dividin’ work eats profits, bounds.’ Hal laughed his beautiful deep laugh, Mr Springett joined till Dan laughed too. ‘You handle tools, I see,’ said Mr Springett. ‘I reckon, you are way like me, you have found hindered those--Guilds, call ‘them?---Unions, say.’ ‘You may say so!’ Hal pointed white scar his cheekbone. ‘This remembrance Master watching-Foreman Masons Magdalen Tower, because, please you, I dared carve stone without leave. They said stone slipped cornice accident.’ ‘I know accidents. There is way disprove ‘them. An’ stones are not things slip,’ Mr Springett grunted. Hal went on: ‘I have seen scaffold-plank keckle shoot too-clever workman thirty foot cold chancel floor below. And rope break--’ ‘Yes, natural nature; an’ lime’ll fly man’s eyes without breath wind sometimes,’ said Mr Springett. ‘But who is show ‘twasn’t accident?’ ‘Who things?’ Dan asked, straightened his back bench he turned schooner end-for-end vice get her counter. ‘Them do not wish men work better quicker do,’ growled Mr Springett. ‘Do not pinch her hard vice, Mus’ Dan. Put piece rag jaws, you will bruise her. More that’--he turned towards Hal--‘if man his private spite laid you, Unions give his excuse workin’ off.’ ‘Well I know it,’ said Hal. ‘They never let go, spiteful ones. I knowed plasterer Eighteen hundred Sixty-one--down wells. He Frenchy--a bad enemy he was.’ ‘I mine too. He Italian, called Benedetto. I met first Oxford Magdalen Tower I learning trade-or trades, I say. A bad enemy he was, say, he came singular good friend,’ said Hal he put mallet settled comfortably. ‘What might his trade been--plastering’ Mr Springett asked. ‘Plastering sort. He worked stucco--fresco call it. Made pictures plaster. Not he fine sweep hand drawing. He would take long sides cloister, trowel his stuff, roll his great all-abroad pictures saints croppy-topped trees quick webster unrolling cloth almost. Oh, Benedetto could draw, ‘a little-minded man, professing full secrets colour plaster--common tricks, ‘them--and his one single talk Tom, Dick Harry stole t’other secret art him.’ ‘I know sort,’ said Mr Springett. ‘There is keeping peace making peace such. An’ they are mostly born an’ bone idle.’ ‘True. Even his fellow-countrymen laughed his jealousy. We two came loggerheads early Magdalen Tower. I youngster then. Maybe I spoke mind his work.’ ‘You should not never that.’ Mr Springett shook his head. ‘That sort lay you.’ ‘True enough. This Benedetto specially. Body me, man lived hate me! But I always kept eyes open plank scaffold. I mighty glad shut he quarrelled his Guild foreman, went off, nose air, paints his arm. But’--Hal leaned forward--‘if hate man man hates you--’ ‘I know. You are everlastin’ running acrost him,’ Mr Springett interrupted. ‘Excuse me, sir.’ He leaned window, shouted carter loading cart bricks. ‘Are not sense heap ‘them way?’ he said. ‘Take an’ throw hundred ‘them off. It is team compass. Throw ‘them off, I tell you, make another trip what is left over. Excuse me, sir. You sayin’-’ ‘I saying end year I went Bury strengthen lead-work great Abbey east window there.’ ‘Now that is one things I have never done. But I mind cheap excursion Chichester Eighteen hundred Seventy-nine, an’ I went an’ watched ‘them leadin’ won’erful fine window Chichester Cathedral. I stayed watchin’ till ‘it was time us go back. Do Not Know I two drinks p’raps, day.’ Hal smiled. ‘At Bury, then, sure enough, I met enemy Benedetto. He painted picture plaster south wall Refectory--a noble place noble thing--a picture Jonah.’ ‘Ah! Jonah an’ his whale. I have never far Bury. You have worked lot,’ said Mr Springett, his eyes carter below. ‘No. Not whale. This picture Jonah pompion withered. But Benedetto shown peevish grey-beard huggled angle-edged drapery beneath pompion wooden trellis. This last, dead thing, he would drawn ‘twere life. But fierce old Jonah, bared sun, angry even death his cold prophecy disproven--Jonah, ashamed, already hearing children Nineveh running mock him--ah, Benedetto drawn!’ ‘He better ha’ stuck his whale, then,’ said Mr Springett. ‘He would ha’ done better that. He draws damp cloth picture, an’ shows me. I craftsman too, d’ye see?’ ‘“It Is good,” I said, “but goes deeper plaster.” ‘“What?” he said whisper. ‘“Be thy judge, Benedetto,” I answered. “Does go deeper plaster?” ‘He reeled piece dry wall. “No,” he says, “and I know it. I could hate thee I done five years, I live, I try, Hal. I try.” Then he goes away. I pitied him, I spoken truth. His picture went deeper plaster.’ ‘Ah!’ said Mr Springett, turned quite red. ‘You talkin’ fast I did not understand drivin’ at. I have seen men--good workmen was--try could do, and--and could not compass it. They knowed it, nigh broke hearts like. You right, course, sir, say thought his work; you will excuse me, duty?’ ‘I wrong say it,’ Hal replied. ‘God forgive me--I young! He workman enough know he failed. But came evens long run. By token, ye ever hear one Torrigiano--Torrisany called him?’ ‘I cannot say I ever did. Was he Frenchy like?’ ‘No, hectoring, hard-mouthed, long-sworded Italian builder, vain peacock strong bull, but, mark you, master workman. More that--he could get his best work worst men.’ ‘Which it is gift. I foreman-bricklayer like once,’ said Mr Springett. ‘He used prod ‘them back like pointing-trowel, wonders.’ I have seen Torrisany lay ‘prentice one buffet raise another--to make mason him. I worked building chapel London--a chapel tomb King.’ ‘I never knew kings went chapel much,’ said Mr Springett. ‘But I always hold man--do not care he be--seein’ his grave he dies. ‘Tidn’t sort thing leave family will’s read. I reckon ‘it was fine vault?’ ‘None finer England. This Torrigiano contract it, you would say. He picked master craftsmen parts--England, France, Italy, Low Countries--no odds long knew work, he drove like--like pigs Brightling Fair. He called us English pigs. We suffered he master his craft. If he misliked work man done, his great hands he would rive out, tear us all. “Ah, pig--you English pig!” he would scream dumb wretch’s face. “You answer me? You look me? You think me? Come cloisters. I teach carving myself. I gild over!” But his passion blown out, he would slip his arm round man’s neck, impart knowledge worth gold. ‘Twould done heart good, Mus’ Springett, see two hundred us masons, jewellers, carvers, gilders, iron-workers rest--all toiling like cock-angels, mad Italian hornet fleeing one next chapel. Done heart good, would!’ ‘I believe you,’ said Mr Springett. ‘In Eighteen hundred Fifty-four, I mind, railway bein’ made Hastin’s. There two thousand navvies it--all young--all strong--an’ I one ‘them. Oh, dearie me! Excuse me, sir, enemy workin’ you?’ ‘Benedetto? Be sure he was. He followed like lover. He painted pictures chapel ceiling--slung chair. Torrigiano made us promise fight till work finished. We master craftsmen, ye see, he needed us. None less, I never went aloft carve ‘thout testing ropes knots morning. We never far other. Benedetto ‘ud sharpen his knife his sole he waited his plaster dry--wheet, wheet, wheet. I would hear I hung chipping round pillar-head, we would nod friendly-like. Oh, he craftsman, Benedetto, his hate spoiled his eye his hand. I mind night I finished models bronze saints round tomb; Torrigiano embraced chapel, bade supper. I met Benedetto I came out. He slavering porch Like mad dog.’ ‘Workin’ it?’ said Mr Springett. ‘Did he ye night?’ ‘No, no. That time he kept his oath Torrigiano. But I pitied him. Eh, well! Now I come follies. I never thought little myself; Torrisany put his arm round neck, I--I’--Hal broke laugh--‘I lay much odds ‘twixt cock-sparrow his pride.’ ‘I pretty middlin’ young time,’ said Mr Springett. ‘Then ye know man cannot drink dice dress fine, keep company his station, his work suffers it, Mus’ Springett.’ ‘I never held much dressin’ up, but--you are right! The worst mistakes I ever made made Monday morning,’ Mr Springett answered. ‘We have one sort fool t’other. Mus’ Dan, Mus’ Dan, take smallest gouge, you will spluttin’ her stem works clean out. Cannot ye see grain wood do not favour chisel?’ ‘I will spare follies. But man called Brygandyne--Bob Brygandyne--Clerk King’s Ships, little, smooth, bustling atomy, clever woman get work done nothing--a won’erful smooth-tongued pleader. He made much me, asked draft drawing, piece carved gilt scroll-work bows one King’s Ships--the SOVEREIGN her name.’ ‘Was she man-of-war?’ asked Dan. ‘She warship, woman called Catherine Castile desired King give her ship pleasure-ship her own. I know time, she would Bob get scroll-work done fitted King might see it. I made picture, hour, heat supper--one great heaving play dolphins Neptune reining webby-footed sea-horses, Arion his harp high atop them. It twenty-three foot long, maybe nine foot deep--painted gilt.’ It must ha’ justabout looked fine,’ said Mr Springett. ‘That is curiosity it. ‘It Was bad--rank bad. In conceit I must needs show Torrigiano, chapel. He straddles his legs, hunches his knife behind him, whistles like storm-cock sleet-shower. Benedetto behind him. We never far apart, I have told you. ‘“That pig’s work,” says Master. “Swine’s work. You make things, even fine Court suppers, shall sent away.” ‘Benedetto licks his lips like cat. “It bad then, Master?” he says. “What pity!” ‘“Yes,” says Torrigiano. “Scarcely could things bad. I condescend show.” ‘He talks there. No shouting, swearing (it bad that); good, memorable counsel, bitten slowly. Then he sets draft pair iron gates, take, he said, taste naughty dolphins mouth.

A week settled stomach handsomely, Master let put work smithy, I sweated foolish pride.’ ‘Good stuff good iron,’ said Mr Springett. ‘I done pair lodge gates Eighteen hundred Sixty-three.’ ‘Oh, I forgot say Bob Brygandyne whipped away draft ship’s scroll-work, would give back re-draw. He said ‘twould well enough. Howsoever, lawful work kept busied remember him. Body me, I worked winter upon gates bronzes tomb I would never worked before! I leaner lath, I lived--I lived then!’ Hal looked Mr Springett his wise, crinkled-up eyes, old man smiled back. ‘Ouch!’ Dan cried. He hollowing schooner’s after-deck, little gouge slipped gashed ball his left thumb,--an ugly, triangular tear. ‘That came steadying wrist,’ said Hal calmly. ‘Do not bleed wood. Do work heart’s blood, need let show.’ He rose peered corner loft. Mr Springett risen too, swept ball cobwebs rafter. ‘Clap on,’ he said, ‘and put handkerchief atop. ‘Twill cake minute. It do not hurt now, it?’ ‘No,’ said Dan indignantly. ‘You know happened lots times. I will tie myself. Go on, sir.’ ‘And it will happen hundreds times more,’ said Hal friendly nod he sat again. But he go till Dan’s hand tied properly. Then he said: ‘One dark December day--too dark judge colour--we sitting talking round fires chapel (you heard good talk there), Bob Brygandyne bustles and--“Hal, you are sent for,” he squeals.

My eye hand purified past months, d’ye see, iron work. ‘“I could better now,” I said. The I studied squabby Neptunes less I liked ‘them; Arion pure flaming shame atop unbalanced dolphins. ‘“I doubt fresh expense draft again,” he says. ‘“Bob never paid first draft. I lay he will never pay second. ‘Twill cost King nothing I re-draw it,” I says. ‘“There is woman wishes done quickly,” he says. “We will stick first drawing, Master Dawe. But thirty pounds thirty pounds. You must make less.” ‘And faults draft fair leaped hit eyes. At cost, I thinks myself, I must get back re-draft it. He grunts impatiently, splendid thought comes me, shall save me. By token, It quite honest.’ ‘They are not always,’ says Mr Springett. ‘How get it?’ ‘By truth.

She will shapes weathers. Does make odds?” ‘“Why, then,” says I, “the first heavy sea she sticks her nose into’ll claw half scroll-work, next finish it.

She never carry weight her bows.” ‘He looks squintlings plucks his under-lip. ‘“Is honest, unswayed opinion?” he says. ‘“Body me! Ask about!” I says. “Any seaman could tell ‘it is true.

That thought shrivelled insides I folding away draft. On heels it--maybe you will see why--I began grin myself. I thought earnest simplicity man--the King, I say--because I would saved money; his smile though he would half France! I thought silly pride foolish expectations day he would honour master craftsman. I thought broken-tipped sword he would found behind hangings; dirt cold room, his cold eye, wrapped his concerns, scarcely resting me. Then I remembered solemn chapel roof bronzes stately tomb he would lie in, and--d’ye see?---the unreason all--the mad high humour all--took hold till I sat dark stair-head passage, laughed till I could laugh more. What else could I done? ‘I never heard his feet behind me--he always walked like cat--but his arm slid round neck, pulling back I sat, till head lay his chest, his left hand held knife plumb heart--Benedetto! Even I laughed--the fit beyond holding--laughed he ground his teeth ear. He stark crazed time. ‘“Laugh,” he said. “Finish laughter. I will cut ye short. Tell now”--he wrenched head--“why King chose honour you,--you--you--you lickspittle Englishman? I full patience now. I waited long.” Then he score his Jonah Bury Refectory, I would said it, his pictures chapel men praised none looked twice (as fault!), whole parcel words looks treasured years. ‘“Ease arm little,” I said. “I cannot die choking, I dubbed knight, Benedetto.” ‘“Tell me, I will confess ye, Sir Harry Dawe, Knight. There is long night ye. Tell,” says he. ‘So I told him--his chin crown--told all; told well many words I ever told tale supper Torrigiano. I knew Benedetto would understand, for, mad sad, he craftsman. I believed last tale I would ever tell top mortal earth, I would put bad work I left Lodge. All art’s one art, I said. I bore Benedetto malice. My spirits, d’ye see, catched high, solemn exaltation, I saw earth’s vanities foreshortened little, laid like town cathedral scaffolding. I told befell, I thought it. I gave King’s voice “Master Dawe, you have saved thirty pounds!”; his peevish grunt he looked sword; badger-eyed figures Glory Victory leered Flemish hangings. Body me, ‘it was fine, noble tale, and, I thought, last work earth. ‘“That I honoured King,” I said. “They will hang ye killing me, Benedetto. And, since you have killed King’s Palace, they will draw quarter you; you are mad care. Grant me, though, ye never heard better tale.” ‘He said nothing, I felt shake. My head his chest shook; his right arm fell away, his left dropped knife, he leaned hands shoulder--shaking--shaking! I turned round. No need put foot his knife. The man speechless laughter--honest craftsman’s mirth. The first time I would ever seen laugh. You know mirth cuts breath, ye stamp snatch short ribs? That Benedetto’s case. ‘When he began roar bay whoop passage, I haled street, leaned wall again--waving hands wagging heads--till watch came know drunk. ‘Benedetto says ‘them, solemn owl: “You saved thirty pounds, Mus’ Dawe,” he pealed. In sort mad-drunk--I dear life given back me, he because, he said afterwards, old crust hatred round his heart broke carried away laughter. His face changed too. ‘“Hal,” he cries, “I forgive thee. Forgive too, Hal. Oh, English, English! Did gall thee, Hal, see rust dirty sword? Tell again, Hal, King grunted joy. Oh, let us tell Master.” ‘So reeled back chapel, arms round other’s necks, could speak--he thought we would fighting--we told Master. Yes, told Torrigiano, he laughed till he rolled new cold pavement. Then he knocked heads together. ‘“Ah, English!” he cried. “You pigs. You English. Now well punished dirty fishes. Put draft fire, never more. You fool, Hal, fool, Benedetto, I need works please beautiful English King.” ‘“And I meant kill Hal,” says Benedetto. “Master, I meant kill English King made knight.” ‘“Ah!” says Master, shaking his finger. “Benedetto, killed Hal, I killed you--in cloister. But craftsman too, I killed like craftsman, very, slowly--in hour, I could spare time!” That Torrigiano--the Master!’ Mr Springett sat quite still time Hal finished. Then he turned dark red; he rocked fro; he coughed wheezed till tears ran his face. Dan knew he laughing, surprised Hal first. ‘Excuse me, sir,’ said Mr Springett, ‘but I thinkin’ stables I built gentleman Eighteen hundred Seventy-four. They stables blue brick--very particular work. Do Not Know were not best job ever I would done. But gentleman’s lady--she would come Lunnon, new married--she buildin’ called haw-haw--what an’ ‘ud call dik--right acrost his park. A middlin’ big job I would contract of, she spoke library it. But I told her line springs she wanted dig her ditch, an’ she would flood park she went on.’ ‘Were springs all?’ said Hal. ‘Bound springs everywhere dig deep enough, are not there? But I said springs put her conceit diggin’ haw-haws, an’ she took an’ built white tile dairy instead. But I sent last bill stables, gentleman he paid ‘thout even lookin’ it, I had not forgotten nothing, I assure you. More that, he slips two five-pound notes hand library, an’ “Ralph,” he says--he allers called name--“Ralph,” he says, “you have saved heap expense an’ trouble autumn.” I did not say nothing, course. I knowed he did not want haws-haws digged acrost his park more’n I did, I never said nothing. No he did not say nothing blue-brick stables, really best an’ honestest piece work I would done quite while. He give ten pounds savin’ hem deal trouble home. I reckon things pretty much alike, times, places.’ Hal he laughed together. Dan could not quite understand thought funny, went his work time without speaking. When he looked up, Mr Springett, alone, wiping his eyes his green-and-yellow pocket-handkerchief. ‘Bless me, Mus’ Dan, I have asleep,’ he said. ‘An’ I have dreamed dream made laugh--laugh I are not laughed long day. I cannot remember ‘it was about, say old men take laughin’ sleep, they are middlin’ ripe next world. Have workin’ honest, Mus’ Dan?’ ‘Ra-ather,’ said Dan, unclamping schooner vice. ‘And look I have cut small gouge.’ ‘Ye-es. You want lump cobwebs that,’ said Mr Springett. ‘Oh, I see you have put already. That is right, Mus’ Dan.’ King Henry VII Shipwrights Harry King England London town gone, And comen Hamull Hoke countie Suthampton. For lay MARY OF THE TOWER, his ship war strong, And he would discover, certaynely, his shipwrights wrong. He told none his setting forth, yet he would go (But Lord Arundel), meanly he show, In old jerkin patched hose man might mark; With his frieze hood cloak about, he looked like clerk. He Hamull Hoke hour tide, And saw MARY haled dock, winter abide, With her tackle habiliments King his own; But ran his false shipwrights stripped her bone. They heaved main-mast overboard, trusty tree, And wrote spent lost force weather sea. But sawen planks strakes far might go, To maken beds wives little children also. There knave called Slingawai, he crope beneath deck, Crying: ‘Good felawes, come see! The ship nigh wreck! For storm took tall main-mast, blew fierce fell, Alack! hath taken kettles pans, brass pott well!’ With he set pott his head hied hatch, While shipwrights ran find might snatch; All except Bob Brygandyne he yeoman good, He caught Slingawai round waist threw mud. ‘I taken plank rope nail, without King his leave, After custom Portesmouth, I suffer thief.

Then came Lord Arundel pricking across down, And behind Mayor Burgesses merry Suthampton town. They drew naughty shipwrights up, kettles hands, And bound round forecastle wait King’s commands. But ‘Since ye made beds,’ said King, ‘ye needs must lie thereon. For sake wives little ones--felawes, get gone!’ When beaten Slingawai, his lips, Our King appointed Brygandyne Clerk his ships. ‘Nay, never lift thy hands me--there is clean hands trade.

Weather rain undone again, And would never know There road woods Before planted trees. It underneath coppice heath, And thin anemones. Only keeper sees That, ring-dove broods, And badgers roll ease, There road woods. Yet, enter woods Of summer evening late, When night-air cools trout-ringed pools Where otter whistles his mate (They fear men woods Because see few), You hear beat horse’s feet And swish skirt dew, Steadily cantering The misty solitudes, As though perfectly knew The old lost road woods... But road woods! Marklake Witches When Dan took boat-building, Una coaxed Mrs Vincey, farmer’s wife Little Lindens, teach her milk. Mrs Vincey milks pasture summer, different milking she would, cows tied up, know stand still. After three weeks Una could milk Red Cow Kitty Shorthorn quite dry, without her wrists aching, she allowed Dan look. But milking amuse him, pleasanter Una alone quiet pastures quiet-spoken Mrs Vincey. So, evening evening, she slipped across Little Lindens, took her stool fern-clump beside fallen oak, went work, her pail her knees, her head pressed hard cow’s flank. As often not, Mrs Vincey would milking cross Pansy end pasture, would come near till time strain pour off. Once, middle milking, Kitty Shorthorn boxed Una’s ear her tail. ‘You old pig!’ said Una, nearly crying, cow’s tail hurt. ‘Why did not tie down, child?’ said voice behind her. ‘I meant to, flies bad I let her off--and she is done!’ Una looked round, expecting Puck, saw curly-haired girl, much taller herself, older, dressed curious high-waisted, lavender-coloured riding-habit, high hunched collar deep cape belt fastened steel clasp. She wore yellow velvet cap tan gauntlets, carried real hunting-crop. Her cheeks pale except two pretty pink patches middle, she talked little gasps end her sentences, though she running. ‘You do not milk badly, child,’ she said, she smiled her teeth showed small even pearly. ‘Can milk?’ Una asked, flushed, she heard Puck’s chuckle. He stepped fern sat down, holding Kitty Short-horn’s tail. ‘There is not much,’ he said, ‘that Miss Philadelphia does not know milk--or, matter, butter eggs. She is great housewife.’ ‘Oh,’ said Una. ‘I am sorry I cannot shake hands. Mine milky; Mrs Vincey going teach butter-making summer.’ ‘Ah! I am going London summer,’ girl said, ‘to aunt Bloomsbury.’ She coughed she began hum, ‘“Oh, town! What wonderful metropolis!” ‘You have got cold,’ said Una. ‘No. Only stupid cough. But it is vastly better last winter. It disappear London air. Every one says so. D’you like doctors, child?’ ‘I do not know any,’ Una replied. ‘But I am sure I should not.’ ‘Think lucky, child. I beg pardon,’ girl laughed, Una frowned. ‘I am child, name’s Una,’ she said. ‘Mine’s Philadelphia. But everybody except Rene calls Phil. I am Squire Bucksteed’s daughter--over Marklake yonder.’ She jerked her little round chin towards south behind Dallington. ‘Sure-ly know Marklake?’ ‘We went picnic Marklake Green once,’ said Una. ‘It is awfully pretty. I like funny little roads do not lead anywhere.’ ‘They lead land,’ said Philadelphia stiffly, ‘and coach road four miles away. One go anywhere Green. I went Assize Ball Lewes last year.’ She spun round took dancing steps, stopped her hand her side. ‘It gives stitch,’ she explained. ‘No odds. ‘Twill go away London air. That is latest French step, child. Rene taught me. D’you hate French, chi--Una?’ ‘Well, I hate French, course, I do not mind Ma’m’selle. She is rather decent. Is Rene French governess?’ Philadelphia laughed till she caught her breath again. ‘Oh no! Rene’s French prisoner--on parole. That means he is promised escape till he properly exchanged Englishman. He is doctor, I hope will not think worth exchanging. My uncle captured last year FERDINAND privateer, Belle Isle, he cured uncle r-r-raging toothache. Of course, could not let lie among common French prisoners Rye, he stays us. He is old family--a Breton, nearly next door true Briton, father says--and he wears his hair clubbed--not powdered. Much becoming, do not think?’ ‘I do not know you are--’ Una began, Puck, side pail, winked, she went her milking. ‘He is going great French physician war over. He makes bobbins lace-pillow now--he is clever his hands; he would doctor people Green would let him. Only Doctor--Doctor Break--says he is emp--or imp something--worse imposter. But Nurse says--’ ‘Nurse! You are ever old. What got nurse for?’ Una finished milking, turned round her stool Kitty Shorthorn grazed off. ‘Because I cannot get rid her. Old Cissie nursed mother, she says she will nurse till she dies. The idea! She never let us alone. She thinks I am delicate. She grown infirm her understanding, know. Mad--quite mad, poor Cissie!’ ‘Really mad?’ said Una. ‘Or silly?’ ‘Crazy, I say--from things she does. Her devotion terribly embarrassing. You know I keys Hall except brewery tenants’ kitchen. I give stores linen plate.’ ‘How jolly! I love store-rooms giving things.’ Ah, it is great responsibility, you will find, come age. Last year Dad said I fatiguing duties, he actually wanted give keys old Amoore, housekeeper. I would not. I hate her. I said, “No, sir. I Mistress Marklake Hall long I live, I am never going married, I shall give stores linen till I die!” And father say?’ ‘Oh, I threatened pin dishclout his coat-tail. He ran away. Every one’s afraid Dad, except me.’ Philadelphia stamped her foot. ‘The idea! If I cannot make father happy his house, I would like meet woman can, and--and--I would living hide her!’ She cut her long-thonged whip. It cracked like pistol-shot across still pasture. Kitty Shorthorn threw her head trotted away. ‘I beg pardon,’ Philadelphia said; ‘but makes furious. Do not hate ridiculous old quizzes feathers fronts, come dinner call “child” chair table?’ ‘I do not always come dinner, said Una, ‘but I hate called “child.” Please tell store-rooms giving things.’ Ah, it is great responsibility--particularly old cat Amoore looking lists shoulder. And shocking thing happened last summer! Poor crazy Cissie, Nurse I telling of, she took three solid silver tablespoons.’ ‘Took! But is not stealing?’ Una cried. ‘Hsh!’ said Philadelphia, looking round Puck. ‘All I say she took without leave. I made right afterwards. So, Dad says--and he is magistrate-, was not legal offence; compounding felony. ‘It sounds awful,’ said Una. ‘It was. My dear, I furious! I keys ten months, I would never lost anything before. I said nothing first, big house offers many chances things mislaid, coming hand later. “Fetching lee-scuppers,” uncle calls it. But next week I spoke old Cissie she hair night, she said I was not worry heart trifles!’ ‘Is not like ‘them?’ Una burst out. ‘They see you are worried something really matters, say, “Do not worry”; good!’ ‘I quite agree you, dear; quite agree you! I told Ciss spoons solid silver, worth forty shillings, thief found, he would tried his life.’ ‘Hanged, mean?’ Una said. ‘They ought be; Dad says jury hang man nowadays forty-shilling theft. They transport ‘them penal servitude uttermost ends earth beyond seas, term natural life. I told Cissie that, I saw her tremble mirror. Then she cried, caught hold knees, I could not life understand about,--she cried so. Can guess, dear, poor crazy thing done? It midnight I pieced together. She given spoons Jerry Gamm, Witchmaster Green, he might put charm me! Me!’ ‘Put charm you? Why?’ ‘That is I asked; I saw mad poor Cissie was! You know stupid little cough mine? It disappear soon I go London. She troubled that, thin, she told Jerry promised her, she would bring three silver spoons, he would charm cough away make plump--“flesh up,” she said. I could not help laughing; terrible night! I put Cissie bed, stroke her hand till she cried herself sleep. What else could I done? When she woke, I coughed--I suppose I cough room I please--she said she would killed me, asked her hanged Lewes sooner send her uttermost ends earth away me.’ ‘How awful! What do, Phil?’ ‘Do? I rode five morning talk Master Jerry, new lash whip. Oh, I furious! Witchmaster Witchmaster, I meant to--’ Ah! what is Witchmaster?’ ‘A master witches, course. I do not believe witches; people say every village few, Jerry master Marklake. He smuggler, man-of-war’s man, he pretends carpenter joiner--he make almost anything--but he really white wizard. He cures people herbs charms. He cure Doctor Break given up, that is Doctor Break hates so. He used make toy carts, charm warts I child.’ Philadelphia spread her hands delicate shiny little nails. ‘It is not counted lucky cross him. He his ways getting even you, say. But I was not afraid Jerry! I saw working his garden, I leaned saddle double-thonged shoulders, hedge. Well, dear, first time since Dad gave me, Troubadour (I wish could see sweet creature!) shied across road, I spilled hedge-top. Most undignified! Jerry pulled his side brushed leaves me. I horribly pricked, I did not care. “Now, Jerry,” I said, “I am going take hide first, send Lewes afterwards. You well know why.” ‘“Oh!” he said, he sat among his bee-hives. “Then I reckon you have come old Cissie’s business, dear.” “I reckon I justabout have,” I said. “Stand away hives. I cannot get there.” “That is I I be,” he said. “If you will excuse me, Miss Phil, I do not hold bein’ flogged breakfast, time life.” He is huge big man, he looked comical squatting among hives that--I know I ought not to--I laughed, he laughed. I always laugh wrong time. But I soon recovered dignity, I said, “Then give back made poor Cissie steal!” ‘“Your pore Cissie,” he said. “She is hatful trouble. But shall ‘them, Miss Phil. They are ready put you.” And, would believe it, old sinner pulled three silver spoons his dirty pocket, polished his cuff. “Here be,” he says, he gave me, cool though I would come warts charmed. That is worst people known young. But I preserved composure. “Jerry,” I said, “what world do? If you would caught things you, you would hanged.” ‘“I know it,” he said. “But they are now.” ‘“But made Cissie steal them,” I said. ‘“That I did not,” he said. “Your Cissie, she pickin’ an’ tarrifyin’ long day an’ every day weeks, put charm you, Miss Phil, an’ take away little spitty cough.” ‘“Yes. I knew that, Jerry, make flesh-up!” I said. “I am much obliged you, I am one pigs!” ‘“Ah! I reckon she’ve talking you, then,” he said. “Yes, she give peace, bein’ tarrified--for I do not hold old women--I laid task her I thought ‘ud silence her. I never reckoned old scrattle ‘ud risk her neckbone Lewes Assizes sake, Miss Phil. But she did. She an’ stole, I tell ye, cheerful tinker. You might ha’ knocked one liddle spoons she brung ‘them her apron.” ‘“Do mean say, then, try poor Cissie?” I screamed him. ‘“What else for, dearie?” he said. “I do not stand need hedge-stealings. I am freeholder, money bank; I will not trust women more! Silly old besom! I beleft she would ha’ stole Squire’s big fob-watch, I would required her.” ‘“Then you are wicked, wicked old man,” I said, I angry I could not help crying, course made cough. ‘Jerry fearful taking. He picked carried his cottage--it is full foreign curiosities--and he got something eat drink, he said he would hanged neck day pleased me. He said he would even tell old Cissie he sorry. That is great comedown Witchmaster, know. ‘I ashamed silly, I dabbed eyes said, “The least give poor Ciss sort charm me.” ‘“Yes, that is fair dealings,” he said. “You know names Twelve Apostles, dearie? You say names, one one, open window, rain storm, wet shine, five times day fasting. But mind you, ‘twixt every name draw breath nose, right pretty liddle toes, long deep can, let slow pretty liddle mouth. There is virtue cough names spoke way. And I will give something see, moreover. Here is stick maple, warmest tree wood.”’ ‘That is true,’ Una interrupted. ‘You feel almost warm touch it.’ ‘“It is cut one inch long every year,” Jerry said. “That is sixteen inches. You set window holds sash, thus keep it, rain shine, wet fine, day night. I have said words virtue complaints.” “I have not complaints, Jerry,” I said. “It is please Cissie.” ‘“I know well do, dearie,” he said. And--and came going give flogging. I wonder whether he made poor Troubadour shy I lashed him? Jerry his ways getting even people.’ ‘I wonder,’ said Una. ‘Well, try charm? Did work?’ ‘What nonsense! I told Rene it, course, he is doctor. He is going famous doctor. That is doctor hates him. Rene said, “Oho! Your Master Gamm, he worth knowing,” he put his eyebrows--like this. He made joke all. He see window carpenter’s she would, he works, ever maple stick fell down, he pretended fearful taking till I propped window again. He used ask whether I said Apostles properly, I took deep breaths. Oh yes, next day, though he ever many times before, he put his new hat paid Jerry Gamm visit state--as fellow-physician. Jerry never guessed Rene making fun him, he told Rene sick people village, he cured herbs Doctor Break given up. Jerry could talk smugglers’ French, course, I taught Rene plenty English, he was not shy. They called Monsieur Gamm Mosheur Lanark, like gentlemen. I suppose amused poor Rene. He has not much do, except fiddle carpenter’s shop. He is like French prisoners--always making knickknacks; Jerry little lathe his cottage, so--and so--Rene took Jerry much I approved of. The Hall big empty Dad’s away, I sit old Amoore--she talks horridly every one--specially Rene. ‘I rude Rene, I am afraid; I properly served it. One always is. You see, Dad went Hastings pay his respects General commanded brigade there, bring Hall afterwards. Dad told he brave soldier India--he Colonel Dad’s Regiment, Thirty-third Foot, Dad left Army, he changed his name Wesley Wellesley, else way about; Dad said I get silver him, I knew meant big dinner. So I sent sea early mackerel, morning kitchen store-rooms. Old Amoore nearly cried. ‘However, dear, I made preparations ample time, fish did not arrive--it never does--and I wanted Rene ride Pevensey bring himself. He gone Jerry, course, he always used, unless I requested his presence beforehand. I cannot send Rene every time I want him. He there. Now, do not ever I did, child, it is highest degree unladylike; but--but one Woods runs Jerry’s garden, climb--it is ungenteel, I climb like kitten--there is old hollow oak pigsty hear see everything below. Truthfully, I went tell Rene mackerel, I saw Jerry sitting seat playing wooden toy trumpets. So I slipped hollow, choked cough, listened. Rene never shown trumpets.’ ‘Trumpets? Are not old trumpets?’ said Una. ‘They were not real trumpets, Jerry opened his short-collar, Rene put one end his trumpet Jerry’s chest, put his ear other. Then Jerry put his trumpet Rene’s chest, listened Rene breathed coughed. I afraid I would cough too. ‘“This hollywood one best,” said Jerry. “‘It Is won’erful like hearin’ man’s soul whisperin’ his innards; unless I have buzzin’ ears, Mosheur Lanark, make much kind noises old Gaffer Macklin--but quite loud young Copper. It sounds like breakers reef--a long way off. Comprenny?” ‘“Perfectly,” said Rene. “I drive breakers. But I strike, I shall save hundreds, thousands, millions perhaps, little trumpets. Now tell sounds old Gaffer Macklin made his chest, young Copper also.” ‘Jerry talked nearly quarter hour sick people village, Rene asked questions. Then he sighed, said, “You explain well, Monsieur Gamm, I opportunities listen myself! Do think poor people would let listen trumpet--for little money? No?”--Rene’s poor church mouse. ‘“They would kill you, Mosheur. It is I coax ‘them abide it, I am Jerry Gamm,” said Jerry. He is proud his attainments. ‘“Then poor people alarmed--No?” said Rene. ‘“They have time back tryin’ trumpets sick; I reckon talk alehouse will not stand much more. Tom Dunch an’ his kidney drinkin’ riot-ripe I passed along noon. Charms an’ mutterin’s an’ bits red wool an’ black hens way nature fools, Mosheur; anything likely ‘them real service devil’s work estimation. If I you, I would go home come.” Jerry spoke quite quietly, Rene shrugged his shoulders. ‘“I prisoner parole, Monsieur Gamm,” he said. “I home.” ‘Now unkind Rene. He is often told he looked England his home. I suppose it is French politeness. ‘“Then we will talk something matters,” said Jerry. “Not name names, Mosheur Lanark, might opinion one are not old Gaffer Macklin young Copper? Is person better worse?” ‘“Better--for time is,” said Rene. He meant time being, I never could teach phrases. ‘“I thought too,” said Jerry. “But time come?” ‘Rene shook his head, he blew his nose. You do not know odd man looks blowing his nose sitting directly him. ‘“I have thought too,” said Jerry. He rumbled deep I could scarcely catch. “It do not make much odds me, I am old. But you are young, Mosheur--you are young,” he put his hand Rene’s knee, Rene covered his hand. I did not know friends. ‘“Thank you, mon ami,” said Rene. “I much oblige. Let us return trumpet-making. But I forget”--he stood up--“it appears receive afternoon!” ‘You cannot see Gamm’s Lane oak, gate opened, fat little Doctor Break stumped in, mopping his head, half-a-dozen people following him, drunk. ‘You ought seen Rene bow; he beautifully. ‘“A word you, Laennec,” said Doctor Break. “Jerry practising devilry poor wretches, they have asked arbiter.” ‘“Whatever means, I reckon it is safer asking doctor,” said Jerry, Tom Dunch, one carters, laughed. ‘“That are not right feeling you, Tom,” Jerry said, “seeing clever Doctor Break put away thorn flesh last winter.” Tom’s wife died Christmas, though Doctor Break bled her twice week. Doctor Break danced rage. ‘“This beside mark,” he said. “These good people willing testify you have impudently prying God’s secrets means papistical contrivance person”--he pointed poor Rene--“has furnished with. Why, things themselves!” Rene holding trumpet his hand. ‘Then men talked once. They said old Gaffer Macklin dying stitches his side Jerry put trumpet--they called devil’s ear-piece; said left round red witch-marks people’s skins, dried lights, made ‘them spit blood, threw ‘them sweats. Terrible things said. You never heard noise. I took advantage cough. ‘Rene Jerry standing backs pigsty. Jerry fumbled his big flap pockets fished pair pistols. You ought seen men give back he cocked his. He passed one Rene. ‘“Wait! Wait!” said Rene. “I explain doctor he permits.” He waved trumpet him, men gate shouted, “Do not touch it, Doctor! Do not lay hand thing.” ‘“Come, come!” said Rene. “You big fool pretend. No?” ‘Doctor Break backed toward gate, watching Jerry’s pistol, Rene followed his trumpet, like nurse trying amuse child, put ridiculous thing his ear show used, talked la Gloire, l’Humanite, la Science, Doctor Break watched jerry’s pistol swore. I nearly laughed aloud. ‘“Now listen! Now listen!” said Rene. “This moneys pockets, dear confrere. You become rich.” ‘Then Doctor Break said something adventurers could earn honest living country creeping decent houses taking advantage gentlemen’s confidence enrich base intrigues. ‘Rene dropped his absurd trumpet made one his best bows. I knew he angry way he rolled his “r’s.” ‘“Ver-r-ry good,” said he. “For I shall much pleasure kill here. Monsieur Gamm,”--another bow Jerry--“you please lend pistol, he shall mine. I give word I know best; he choose second his friends there”--another bow drunken yokels gate--“we commence.” ‘“That is fair enough,” said Jerry. “Tom Dunch, owe Doctor his second. Place man.” ‘“No,” said Tom. “No mixin’ gentry’s quarrels me.” And he shook his head went out, others followed him. ‘“Hold on,” said Jerry. “You have forgot set alehouse now. You going search witch-marks; going duck pond; going drag bits sticks little cottage here. What is matter you? Would not like old woman tonight, Tom?” ‘But did not even look back, much less come. They ran village alehouse like hares. ‘“No matter canaille,” said Rene, buttoning his coat show linen. All gentlemen duel, Dad says--and he is five times. “You shall his second, Monsieur Gamm. Give pistol.” ‘Doctor Break took red-hot, he said Rene resigned his pretensions certain quarters he would pass matter. Rene bowed deeper ever. ‘“As that,” he said, “if ignorant are, would known long ago subject remarks living man.” ‘I do not know subject his remarks might been, he spoke simply dreadful voice, dear, Doctor Break turned quite white, said Rene liar; Rene caught throat, choked black. ‘Well, dear, was not deliciously exciting enough, exactly minute I heard strange voice side hedge say, “What is this? What is this, Bucksteed?” father Sir Arthur Wesley horseback lane; Rene kneeling Doctor Break, I oak, listening ears. ‘I must leaned forward much, voice gave start I slipped. I time make one jump pigsty roof--another, tiles broke, pigsty wall--and I bounced garden, behind Jerry, hair full bark. Imagine situation!’ ‘Oh, I can!’ Una laughed till she nearly fell stool. ‘Dad said, “Phil--a--del--phia!” Sir Arthur Wesley said, “Good Ged” Jerry put his foot pistol Rene dropped. But Rene splendid. He never even looked me. He began untwist Doctor Break’s neckcloth fast he would twisted it, asked he felt better. ‘“What is happened? What is happened?” said Dad. ‘“A fit!” said Rene. “I fear confrere fit. Do alarmed. He recovers himself. Shall I bleed little, dear Doctor?” Doctor Break good too. He said, “I vastly obliged, Monsieur Laennec, I restored now.” And he went gate he told Dad syncope--I think. Then Sir Arthur said, “Quite right, Bucksteed. Not another word! They gentlemen.” And he took his cocked hat Doctor Break Rene. ‘But poor Dad would not let well alone. He kept saying, “Philadelphia, mean?” ‘“Well, sir,” I said, “I have come down. As far I could see, looked though Doctor Break sudden seizure.” That quite true--if you would seen Rene seize him. Sir Arthur laughed. “Not much change there, Bucksteed,” he said. “She is lady--a thorough lady.” ‘“Heaven knows she does not look like one,” said poor Dad. “Go home, Philadelphia.” ‘So I went home, dear--do not laugh so!---right Sir Arthur’s nose--a enormous nose--feeling though I twelve years old, going whipped. Oh, I beg pardon, child!’ ‘It is right,’ said Una. ‘I am getting thirteen. I have never whipped, I know felt. All same, must funny!’ ‘Funny! If you would heard Sir Arthur jerking out, “Good Ged, Bucksteed!” every minute rode behind me; poor Dad saying, ‘“‘Pon honour, Arthur, I cannot account it!” Oh, cheeks tingled I reached room! But Cissie laid best evening dress, white satin one, vandyked bottom spots morone foil, pearl knots, know, catching drapery left shoulder. I poor mother’s lace tucker her coronet comb.’ ‘Oh, lucky!’ Una murmured. ‘And gloves?’ ‘French kid, dear’--Philadelphia patted her shoulder--‘and morone satin shoes morone gold crape fan. That restored calm. Nice things always do. I wore hair banded forehead little curl left ear. And I descended stairs, en grande tenue, old Amoore curtsied without stop look her, which, alas! often case. Sir Arthur highly approved dinner, dear: mackerel come time. We Marklake silver out, he toasted health, he asked little bird’s-nesting sister was. I know he quiz me, I looked straight face, dear, I said, “I always send her nursery, Sir Arthur, I receive guests Marklake Hall.”’ ‘Oh, chee--clever you. What he say?’ Una cried. ‘He said, “Not much change there, Bucksteed. Ged, I deserved it,” he toasted again. They talked French shame Sir Arthur commanded brigade Hastings, he told Dad battle India place called Assaye. Dad said terrible fight, Sir Arthur described though whist-party--I suppose lady present.’ ‘Of course lady. I wish I would seen you,’ said Una. ‘I wish had, child. I triumph dinner. Rene Doctor Break came in. They quite made quarrel, told highest esteem other, I laughed said, “I heard every word tree.” You never saw two men frightened life, I said, “What ‘the subject remarks,’ Rene?” neither knew look. Oh, I quizzed unmercifully. They would seen jump pigsty roof, remember.’ ‘But subject remarks?’ said Una. ‘Oh, Doctor Break said professional matter, laugh turned me. I horribly afraid might something unladylike indelicate. But was not triumph. Dad asked play harp. Between me, child, I practising new song London--I do not always live trees--for weeks; I gave surprise.’ ‘What it?’ said Una. ‘Sing it.’ ‘“I given heart flower.” Not difficult fingering, r-r-ravishing sentiment.’ Philadelphia coughed cleared her throat. ‘I have deep voice age size,’ she explained. ‘Contralto, know, ought stronger,’ she began, her face dark last soft pink sunset: ‘I given heart flower, Though I know fading away, Though I know live hour And leave mourn decay! ‘Is not touchingly sweet? Then last verse--I wish I harp, dear--goes low register reach.’She drew her chin, took deep breath: ‘Ye desolate whirlwinds rave, I charge good dear! She all--she I have, And time parting near!’ ‘Beautiful!’ said Una. ‘And like it?’ ‘Like it? They overwhelmed--accables, Rene says. My dear, I had not seen it, I should not believed I could drawn tears, genuine tears, eyes four grown men. But I did! Rene simply could not endure it! He is French sensibility. He hid his face said, “Assez, Mademoiselle! C’est plus fort que moi! Assez!” And Sir Arthur blew his nose said, “Good Ged! This worse Assaye!” While Dad sat tears simply running his cheeks.’ ‘And Doctor Break do?’ ‘He got pretended look window, I saw his little fat shoulders jerk he hiccoughs. That triumph. I never suspected sensibility.’ ‘Oh, I wish I would seen! I wish I would you,’ said Una, clasping her hands. Puck rustled rose fern, big blundering cock-chafer flew smack Una’s cheek. When she finished rubbing place, Mrs Vincey called her Pansy fractious, she would come long help her strain pour off. ‘It did not matter,’ said Una; ‘I waited. Is old Pansy barging lower pasture now?’ ‘No,’ said Mrs Vincey, listening. ‘It sounds like horse galloped middlin’ quick woods; there is road there. I reckon it is one Gleason’s colts loose. Shall I see house, Miss Una?’ ‘Gracious, no! thank you. What is going hurt me?’ said Una, she put her stool away behind oak, strolled home gaps old Hobden kept open her.

The Downs sheep, Weald corn, You glad Sussex born! The Knife Naked Chalk The children went seaside month, lived flint village bare windy chalk Downs, quite thirty miles away home. They made friends old shepherd, called Mr Dudeney, known Father Father little. He talk like people Weald Sussex, he used different names farm things, he understood felt, let go him. He tiny cottage half mile village, his wife made mead thyme honey, nursed sick lambs front coal fire, Old Jim, Mr Dudeney’s sheep-dog’s father, lay door. They brought beef bones Old Jim (you must never give sheep-dog mutton bones), Mr Dudeney happened far Downs, Mrs Dudeney would tell dog take him, he did. One August afternoon village water-cart made street smell specially townified, went look shepherd usual, and, usual, Old Jim crawled doorstep took charge. The sun hot, dry grass slippery, distances distant. ‘It is Just like sea,’ said Una, Old Jim halted shade lonely flint barn bare rise. ‘You see you are going, and--you go there, there is nothing between.’ Dan slipped his shoes. ‘When get home I shall sit woods day,’ he said. ‘Whuff!’ said Old Jim, show he ready, struck across long rolling stretch turf. Presently he asked his beefbone. ‘Not yet,’ said Dan. ‘Where is Mr Dudeney? Where is Master?’ Old Jim looked he thought mad, asked again. ‘Do not give him,’ Una cried. ‘I am going left howling desert.’ ‘Show, boy! Show!’ said Dan, Downs seemed bare palm hand. Old Jim sighed, trotted forward. Soon spied blob Mr Dudeney’s hat sky long way off. ‘Right! All right!’ said Dan. Old Jim wheeled round, took his bone carefully his blunted teeth, returned shadow old barn, looking like wolf. The children went on. Two kestrels hung bivvering squealing them. A gull flapped lazily along white edge cliffs. The curves Downs shook little heat, Mr Dudeney’s distant head. They walked toward slowly found staring horseshoe-shaped hollow hundred feet deep, whose steep sides laced tangled sheep-tracks. The flock grazed flat bottom, charge Young Jim. Mr Dudeney sat comfortably knitting edge slope, his crook his knees. They told Old Jim done. ‘Ah, he thought could see head soon he did. The closeter turf see things. You look warm-like,’ said Mr Dudeney. ‘We be,’ said Una, flopping down. ‘And tired.’ ‘Set beside here. The shadow’ll begin stretch little while, heat-shake wind come that will overlay eyes like much wool.’ ‘We do not want sleep,’ said Una indignantly; she settled herself she spoke, first strip early afternoon shade. ‘OF course not. You come talk father used. He did not need dog guide Norton Pit.’ ‘Well, he belonged here,’ said Dan, laid length turf. ‘He did. And beats he went live among messy trees Weald, he might ha’ stayed looked him. There is profit trees. They draw lightning, sheep shelter ‘them, so, like not, you will lose half-score ewes struck dead one storm. Tck! Your father knew that.’ ‘Trees are not messy.’ Una rose her elbow. ‘And firewood? I do not like coal.’ ‘Eh? You lie piece uphill you will lie natural,’ said Mr Dudeney, his provoking deaf smile. ‘Now press face smell turf. That is Southdown thyme makes Southdown mutton beyond compare, and, mother told me, ‘twill cure anything except broken necks, hearts. I forget which.’ They sniffed, somehow forgot lift cheeks soft thymy cushions. ‘You do not get nothing like Weald. Watercress, maybe?’ said Mr Dudeney. ‘But we have water--brooks full it--where paddle hot weather,’ Una replied, watching yellow-and-violet-banded snail-she will close her eye. ‘Brooks flood. Then must shift sheep--let alone foot-rot afterward. I put dependence dew-pond day.’ ‘How is dew-pond made?’ said Dan, tilted his hat his eyes. Mr Dudeney explained. The air trembled little though could make mind whether slide Pit move across open. But seemed easiest go downhill, children felt one soft puff another slip sidle slope fragrant breaths baffed eyelids. The little whisper sea cliffs joined whisper wind grass, hum insects thyme, ruffle rustle flock below, thickish mutter deep chalk beneath them. Mr Dudeney stopped explaining, went his knitting. They roused voices. The shadow crept halfway steep side Norton Pit, edge it, his back them, Puck sat beside half-naked man seemed busy work. The wind dropped, funnel ground every least noise movement reached like whispers water-Pipe. ‘That clever,’ said Puck, leaning over. ‘How truly shape it!’ ‘Yes, The Beast care brittle flint tip? Bah!’ The man flicked something contemptuously his shoulder. It fell Dan Una--a beautiful dark-blue flint arrow-head still hot maker’s hand. The man reached another stone, worked away like thrush snail-she will. ‘Flint work fool’s work,’ he said last. ‘One one always it; comes dealing The Beast--no good!’ He shook his shaggy head. ‘The Beast dealt long ago. He gone,’ said Puck. ‘He will back lambing time. I know him.’ He chipped carefully, flints squeaked. ‘Not he. Children lie Chalk day go home safe.’ ‘Can they? Well, call The Beast his True Name, I will believe it,’ man replied. ‘Surely!’ Puck leaped his feet, curved his hands round his mouth shouted: ‘Wolf! Wolf!’ Norton Pit threw back echo dry sides--‘Wuff!’ Wuff!’ like Young jim’s bark. ‘You see? You hear?’ said Puck. ‘Nobody answers. Grey Shepherd gone. Feet-in-the-Night run off. There wolves.’ ‘Wonderful!’ The man wiped his forehead though he hot. ‘Who drove away? You?’ ‘Many men many years, working his country. Were one them?’ Puck answered. The man slid his sheepskin cloak his waist, without word pointed his side, seamed blotched scars. His arms, too, dimpled shoulder elbow horrible white dimples. ‘I see,’ said Puck. ‘It The Beast’s mark. What use him?’ ‘Hand, hammer, spear, fathers us.’ ‘So? Then how’--Puck twitched aside man’s dark-brown cloak--‘how Flint-worker come that? Show, man, show!’ He held his little hand. The man slipped long dark iron knife, almost short sword, his belt, breathing it, handed hilt-first Puck, took his head one side, look works watch, squinted dark blade, delicately rubbed his forefinger point hilt. ‘Good!’ said he, surprised tone. ‘It be. The Children Night made it,’ man answered. ‘So I see iron. What might cost you?’ ‘This!’ The man raised his hand his cheek. Puck whistled like Weald starling. ‘By Great Rings Chalk!’ he cried. ‘Was price? Turn sunward I may see better, shut eye.’ He slipped his hand beneath man’s chin swung till he faced children slope. They saw his right eye gone, eyelid lay shrunk. Quickly Puck turned round again, two sat down. ‘It sheep. The sheep people,’ said man, ashamed voice. ‘What else could I done? You know, Old One.’ Puck sighed little fluttering sigh. ‘Take knife. I listen.’ The man bowed his head, drove knife turf, still quivered said: ‘This witness us I speak thing been. Before Knife Naked Chalk I speak. Touch!’ Puck laid hand hilt. It stopped shaking. The children wriggled little nearer. ‘I People Worked Flint. I one son Priestess sells Winds Men Sea. I Buyer Knife--the Keeper People,’ man began, sort singing shout. ‘These names country Naked Chalk, Trees Sea.’ ‘Yours great country. Your names great too,’ said Puck. ‘One cannot feed things names songs.’ The man hit chest. ‘It better--always better--to count one’s children safe round fire, Mother among them.’ ‘Ahai!’ said Puck. ‘I think old tale.’ ‘I warm eat fire I choose, one light fire cook meat. I sold I bought Magic Knife people. It right The Beast master man. What else could I done?’ ‘I hear. I know. I listen,’ said Puck. ‘When I old enough take place Sheepguard, The Beast gnawed country like bone his teeth. He came behind flocks watering-time, watched round Dew-ponds; he leaped folds knees shearing; he walked alongside grazing flocks, chose his meat hoof boys threw flints him; he crept night ‘into huts, licked babe mother’s hands; he called his companions pulled men broad daylight Naked Chalk. No--not always he so! This his cunning! He would go away let us forget him. A year--two years perhaps--we neither smelt, heard, saw him. When flocks increased; men always look behind them; children strayed fenced places; women walked alone draw water--back, back, back came Curse Chalk, Grey Shepherd, Feet-in-the-Night--The Beast, The Beast, The Beast! ‘He laughed little brittle arrows poor blunt spears. He learned run stroke hammer. I think he knew flaw flint. Often show till bring his snout. Then--Pouf!---the false flint falls flinders, left hammer-handle fist, his teeth flank! I felt them. At evening, too, dew, misted rained, spear-head lashings slack off, though kept beneath cloak day. You alone--but close home ponds stop tighten sinews hands, teeth, piece driftwood. You bend pull--so! That minute he followed since stars went out. “Aarh!” he “Wurr-aarh!” he says.’ (Norton Pit gave back growl like pack real wolves.) ‘Then he right shoulder feeling vein neck, and--perhaps sheep run without you. To fight The Beast nothing, despised The Beast he fights you--that like his teeth heart! Old One, men desire greatly, little?’ ‘I know. Did desire much?’ said Puck. ‘I desired master The Beast. It right The Beast master man. But people afraid. Even, Mother, Priestess, afraid I told her I desired. We accustomed afraid The Beast. When I made man, maiden--she Priestess--waited Dew-ponds, The Beast flitted Chalk. Perhaps sickness; perhaps he gone his Gods learn us new harm. But he went, breathed freely. The women sang again; children much guarded; flocks grazed far out. I took mine yonder’--he pointed inland hazy line Weald--‘where new grass best. They grazed north. I followed till close Trees’--he lowered his voice--‘close Children Night live.’ He pointed north again. ‘Ah, I remember thing,’ said Puck. ‘Tell me, people fear Trees extremely?’ ‘Because Gods hate Trees strike lightning. We see burning days along Chalk’s edge. Besides, Chalk knows Children Night, though worship Gods, magicians. When man goes country, change his spirit; put words his mouth; make like talking water. But voice heart told go toward north. While I watched sheep I saw three Beasts chasing man, ran toward Trees. By I knew he Child Night. We Flint-workers fear Trees fear The Beast. He hammer. He carried knife like one. A Beast leaped him. He stretched his knife. The Beast fell dead. The Beasts ran away howling, would never done Flint-worker. The man went among Trees. I looked dead Beast. He killed new way--by single deep, clean cut, without bruise tear, split his bad heart. Wonderful! So I saw man’s knife magic, I thought get it,--thought strongly get it. ‘When I brought flocks shearing, Mother Priestess asked me, “What new thing seen I see face?” I said, “It sorrow me”; she answered, “All new things sorrow. Sit place, eat sorrow.” I sat her place fire, she talks ghosts winter, two voices spoke heart. One voice said, “Ask Children Night Magic Knife. It fit The Beast master man.” I listened voice. ‘One voice said, “If go among Trees, Children Night change spirit. Eat sleep here.” The voice said, “Ask Knife.” I listened voice. ‘I said Mother morning, “I go away find thing people, I know whether I shall return shape.” She answered, “Whether live die, made different, I Mother.” ‘True,’ said Puck. ‘The Old Ones cannot change men’s mothers even would.’ ‘Let us thank Old Ones! I spoke Maiden, Priestess waited Dew-ponds. She promised fine things too.’ The man laughed. ‘I went away place I seen magician knife. I lay two days short grass I ventured among Trees. I felt way stick. I afraid terrible talking Trees. I afraid ghosts branches; soft ground underfoot; red black waters. I afraid, all, Change. It came!’ They saw wipe his forehead again, his strong back-muscles quivered till he laid his hand knife-hilt. ‘A fire without flame burned head; evil taste grew mouth; eyelids shut hot eyes; breath hot teeth, hands like hands stranger. I made sing songs mock Trees, though I afraid them. At time I saw laughing, I sad fine young man, myself. Ah! The Children Night know magic.’ ‘I think done Spirits Mist. They change man, he sleeps among them,’ said Puck. ‘Had slept mists?’ ‘Yes--but I know Children Night. After three days I saw red light behind Trees, I heard heavy noise. I saw Children Night dig red stones hole, lay fires. The stones melted like tallow, men beat soft stuff hammers. I wished speak men, words changed mouth, I could say was, “Do make noise. It hurts head.” By I knew I bewitched, I clung Trees, prayed Children Night take spells. They cruel. They asked many questions would never allow answer. They changed words teeth till I wept. Then led hut covered floor hot stones dashed water stones, sang charms till sweat poured like water. I slept. When I waked, spirit--not strange, shouting thing--was back body, I like cool bright stone shingle sea sunshine. The magicians came hear me--women men--each wearing Magic Knife. Their Priestess Ears Mouth. ‘I spoke. I spoke many words went smoothly along like sheep order shepherd, standing mound, count coming, far getting ready come. I asked Magic Knives people. I said people would bring meat, milk, wool, lay short grass outside Trees, Children Night would leave Magic Knives people take away. They pleased. Their Priestess said, “For whose sake come?” I answered, “The sheep people. If The Beast kills sheep, people die. So I come Magic Knife kill The Beast.” ‘She said, “We know God let us trade people Naked Chalk. Wait till asked.” ‘When came back Question-place (their Gods Gods), Priestess said, “The God needs proof words true.” I said, “What proof?” She said, “The God says come sake people give right eye put out; come reason give it. This proof God. We sorry.” ‘I said, “This hard proof. Is road?” ‘She said, “Yes. You go back people two eyes head choose. But get Magic Knives people.” ‘I said, “It would easier I knew I killed.” ‘She said, “Perhaps God knew too. See! I made knife hot.” ‘I said, “Be quick, then!” With her knife heated flame she put right eye. She herself it. I son Priestess. She Priestess. It work common man.’ ‘True! Most true,’ said Puck. ‘No common man’s work that. And, afterwards?’ ‘Afterwards I see eye more. I found also one eye tell truly things are. Try it!’ At Dan put his hand one eye, reached flint arrow-head grass. He missed inches. ‘It is true,’ he whispered Una. ‘You cannot judge distances bit one eye.’ Puck evidently making experiment, man laughed him. ‘I know so,’ said he. ‘Even I always sure blow. I stayed Children Night till eye healed. They said I son Tyr, God put his right hand Beast’s mouth. They showed melted red stone made Magic Knives it. They told charms sang fires beatings. I sing many charms.’ Then he began laugh like boy. ‘I thinking journey home,’ he said, ‘and surprised Beast. He come back Chalk. I saw him--I smelt his lairs soon ever I left Trees. He know I Magic Knife--I hid cloak--the Knife Priestess gave me. Ho! Ho! That happy day short! See! A Beast would wind me. “Wow!” he would say. “Here Flint-worker!” He would come leaping, tail air; he would roll; he would lay his head his paws merriness heart his warm, waiting meal. He would leap--and, oh, his eye mid-leap he saw--when he saw knife held ready him! It pierced his hide rush pierces curdled milk. Often he time howl. I trouble flay beasts I killed. Sometimes I missed blow. Then I took little flint hammer beat his brains he cowered. He made fight. He knew Knife! But The Beast cunning. Before evening The Beasts smelt blood knife, running like hares. They knew! Then I walked man should--the Master The Beast! ‘So came I back Mother’s house. There lamb killed. I cut two halves knife, I told her tale. She said, “This work God.” I kissed her laughed. I went Maiden waited Dew-ponds. There lamb killed. I cut two halves knife, told her tale. She said, “It work God.” I laughed, she pushed away, blind side, ran I could kiss her. I went Men Sheepguard watering-time. There sheep killed meat. I cut two halves knife, told tale. They said, “It work God.” I said, “We talk much Gods. Let us eat happy, tomorrow I take Children Night, man find Magic Knife.” ‘I glad smell sheep again; see broad sky edge edge, hear sea. I slept beneath stars cloak. The men talked among themselves. ‘I led them, next day, Trees, taking meat, wool, curdled milk, I promised. We found Magic Knives laid grass, Children Night promised. They watched us among Trees. Their Priestess called said, “How people?” I said “Their hearts changed. I cannot see hearts I used to.” She said, “That one eye. Come I eyes.” But I said, “I must show people use knives The Beast, showed use knife.” I said Magic Knife balance like flint. She said, “What done, done sake woman, sake people.” I asked her, “Then God accept right eye, angry?” She answered, “Because man lie God, man lie woman. And I angry you. I sorrowful you. Wait little, see one eye I sorry.” So she hid herself. ‘I went back people, one carrying his Knife, making sing air--tssee-sssse. The Flint never sings. It mutters--ump-ump. The Beast heard. The Beast saw. He knew! Everywhere he ran away us. We laughed. As walked grass Mother’s brother--the Chief Men’s Side--he took his Chief’s necklace yellow sea-stones.’ ‘How? Eh? Oh, I remember! Amber,’ said Puck. ‘And would put neck. I said, “No, I content. What one eye matter eye sees fat sheep fat children running safely?” My Mother’s brother said them, “I told he would never take things.” Then began sing song Old Tongue--The Song Tyr. I sang them, Mother’s brother said, “This song, O Buyer Knife. Let us sing it, Tyr.” ‘Even I understand, till I saw that--that man stepped shadow; I knew thought God, like God Tyr, gave his right hand conquer Great Beast.’ ‘By Fire Belly Flint so?’ Puck rapped out. ‘By Knife Naked Chalk, was! They made way shadow though Priestess walking Barrows Dead. I afraid. I said myself, “My Mother Maiden know I Tyr.” But still I afraid, fear man falls steep flint-pit he runs, feels hard climb out. ‘When came Dew-ponds people there. The men showed knives told tale. The sheep guards also seen The Beast flying us. The Beast went west across river packs--howling! He knew Knife come Naked Chalk last--at last! He knew! So work done. I looked Maiden among Priestesses. She looked me, she smile. She made sign Priestesses must make sacrifice Old Dead Barrows. I would spoken, Mother’s brother made Mouth, though I one Old Dead Barrows Priests speak people Midsummer Mornings.’ ‘I remember. Well I remember Midsummer Mornings!’ said Puck. ‘Then I went away angrily Mother’s house. She would knelt me. Then I angry, she said, “Only God would spoken thus, Priestess. A man would feared punishment Gods.” I looked her I laughed. I could stop unhappy laughing. They called door name Tyr himself. A young man I watched first flocks, chipped first arrow, fought first Beast, called name Old Tongue. He asked leave take Maiden. His eyes lowered, his hands his forehead. He full fear God, me, man, he fear he asked. I kill him. I said, “Call maiden.” She came also without fear--this one waited me, talked me, Dew-ponds. Being Priestess, she lifted her eyes me. As I look hill cloud, she looked me. She spoke Old Tongue Priestesses use make prayers Old Dead Barrows. She asked leave she might light fire companion’s house--and I bless children. I kill her. I heard voice, little cold, say, “Let desire,” went away hand hand. My heart grew little cold; wind shouted ears; eye darkened. I said Mother, “Can God die?” I heard her say, “What it? What it, son?” I fell darkness full hammer-noises. I not.’ ‘Oh, poor--poor God!’ said Puck. ‘And wise Mother?’ ‘She knew. As soon I dropped she knew. When spirit came back I heard her whisper ear, “Whether live die, made different, I Mother.” That good--better even water she gave going away sickness. Though I ashamed fallen down, yet I glad. She glad too. Neither us wished lose other. There one Mother one son. I heaped fire her, barred doors, sat her feet I went away, she combed hair, sang. ‘I said last, “What done people say I Tyr?” ‘She said, “He done God-like thing must bear like God. I see way it. The people sheep till die. You cannot drive off.” ‘I said, “This heavier sheep I lift.” She said, “In time grow easy. In time perhaps lay maiden anywhere. Be wise--be wise, son, nothing left except words, songs, worship God.” ‘Oh, poor God!’ said Puck. ‘But altogether bad things.’ ‘I know not; I would sell all--all--all one small child own, smearing ashes house-fire.’ He wrenched his knife turf, thrust his belt stood up. ‘And yet, else could I done?’ he said. ‘The sheep people.’ ‘It old tale,’ Puck answered. ‘I heard like Naked Chalk, also among Trees--under Oak, Ash, Thorn.’ The afternoon shadows filled quiet emptiness Norton Pit. The children heard sheep-bells Young jim’s busy bark them, scrambled slope level. ‘We let sleep out,’ said Mr Dudeney, flock scattered them. ‘It is making tea-time now.’ ‘Look I have found, said Dan, held little blue flint arrow-head fresh though chipped day. ‘Oh,’ said Mr Dudeney, ‘the closeter turf you are apt see things.

They turned doors trunks packed, strolled Downs towards dull evening sea. The tide dead low chalk cliffs, little wrinkled waves grieved along sands coast Newhaven coast long, grey Brighton, whose smoke trailed across Channel. They walked The Gap, cliff feet high. A windlass hoisting shingle beach stands edge it. The Coastguard cottages little farther on, old ship’s figurehead Turk turban stared wall. ‘This time tomorrow shall home, thank goodness,’ said Una. ‘I hate sea!’ ‘I believe it is right middle,’ said Dan. ‘The edges sorrowful parts.’ Cordery, coastguard, came cottage, levelled his telescope fishing-boats, shut click walked away. He grew smaller smaller along edge cliff, neat piles white chalk every yards show path even darkest night. ‘Where is Cordery going?’ said Una. ‘Half-way Newhaven,’ said Dan. ‘Then he will meet Newhaven coastguard turn back. He says coastguards done away with, smuggling would start once.’ A voice beach cliff began sing: ‘The moon she shined Telscombe Tye-- On Telscombe Tye night was-- She saw smugglers riding by, A pretty sight was!’ Feet scrabbled flinty path. A dark, thin-faced man neat brown clothes broad-toed shoes came up, followed Puck. ‘Three Dunkirk boats standin’ in!’ man went on. ‘Hssh!’ said Puck. ‘You will shock nice young people.’ ‘Oh! Shall I? Mille pardons!’ He shrugged his shoulders almost his ears--spread his hands abroad, jabbered French. ‘No comprenny?’ he said. ‘I will give Low German.’ And he went another language, changing his voice manner completely hardly knew person. But his dark beady-brown eyes still twinkled merrily his lean face, children felt suit straight, plain, snuffy-brown coat, brown knee-breeches, broad-brimmed hat. His hair tied ‘in short pigtail danced wickedly he turned his head. ‘Ha’ done!’ said Puck, laughing. ‘Be one thing t’other, Pharaoh--French English German--no great odds which.’ ‘Oh, is, though,’ said Una quickly. ‘We have not begun German yet, and--and we are going back French next week.’ ‘Are not English?’ said Dan. ‘We heard singing now.’ ‘Aha! That Sussex side me. Dad he married French girl Boulogne, French she stayed till her dyin’ day. She Aurette, course. We Lees mostly marry Aurettes. Have not ever come across saying: ‘Aurettes Lees, Like two peas. What cannot smuggle, They will run seas’? ‘Then, smuggler?’ Una cried; and, ‘Have smuggled much?’ said Dan. Mr Lee nodded solemnly. ‘Mind you,’ said he, ‘I do not uphold smuggling generality mankind--mostly cannot make it--but I brought trade, d’ye see, lawful line descent on’--he waved across Channel--‘on sides water. ‘It Was families, fiddling. The Aurettes used mostly run stuff across Boulogne, Lees landed ran London Town, safest road.’ ‘Then live?’ said Una. ‘You must not ever live close business trade. We kept little fishing smack Shoreham, otherwise Lees honest cottager folk--at Warminghurst Washington--Bramber way--on old Penn estate.’ ‘Ah!’ said Puck, squatted windlass. ‘I remember piece Lees Warminghurst, I do: ‘There never Lee Warminghurst That was not gipsy last first. I reckon that is truth, Pharaoh.’ Pharaoh laughed. ‘Admettin’ that is true,’ he said, ‘my gipsy blood must wore pretty thin, I have made kept worldly fortune.’ ‘By smuggling?’ Dan asked. ‘No, tobacco trade.’ ‘You do not mean say gave smuggling go tobacconist!’ Dan looked disappointed laugh. ‘I am sorry; there is sorts tobacconists,’ Pharaoh replied. ‘How far out, now, would call smack patch her foresail?’ He pointed fishing-boats. ‘A scant mile,’ said Puck quick look. ‘Just about. It is seven fathom her--clean sand. That Uncle Aurette used sink his brandy kegs Boulogne, fished ‘them rowed ‘them The Gap ponies run inland. One thickish night January ‘Ninety-three, Dad Uncle Lot came Shoreham smack, found Uncle Aurette L’Estranges, cousins, waiting us lugger New Year’s presents Mother’s folk Boulogne. I remember Aunt Cecile she would sent fine new red knitted cap, I put there, French Revolution days, red caps fashion. Uncle Aurette tells us cut King Louis’ head, and, moreover, Brest forts fired English man-of-war. The news was not week old. ‘“That means war again, getting used peace,” says Dad. “Why cannot King George’s men King Louis’ men uniforms fight heads?” ‘“Me too, I wish that,” says Uncle Aurette. “But they will pressing better men fight ‘them. The press-gangs already side. You look yours.” ‘“I will bide ashore grow cabbages while, I have run cargo; I wish”--Dad says, going lugger’s side New Year presents his arm young L’Estrange holding lantern--“I wish folk make war easy run one cargo month winter. It ‘ud show ‘them honest work means.” ‘“Well, I have warned ye,” says Uncle Aurette. “I will slipping Revenue cutter comes. Give love Sister take care kegs. It is thicking southward.” ‘I remember waving us young Stephen L’Estrange blowing lantern. By time we would fished kegs fog came thick Dad judged risky row ‘them ashore, even though could hear ponies stamping beach. So he Uncle Lot took dinghy left smack playing fiddle guide ‘them back. ‘Presently I heard guns. Two ‘them sounded mighty like Uncle Aurette’s three-pounders. He did not go naked seas dark. Then come more, I reckoned Captain Giddens Revenue cutter. He open-handed his compliments, he would lay his guns himself. I stopped fiddling listen, I heard whole skyful French fog--and high bow come top smack. I had not time call think. I remember smack heeling over, standing gunwale pushing ship’s side I hoped bear her off. Then square open port, lantern it, slid front nose. I kicked back gunwale went slipped port French ship--me fiddle.’ ‘Gracious!’ said Una. ‘What adventure!’ ‘Did not anybody see come in?’ said Dan. ‘There was not one there. I would made use orlop-deck port--that is next deck gun-deck, rights open all. The crew standing guns above. I rolled pile dunnage dark I went sleep. When I woke, men talking round me, telling names sorrows like Dad told pressed men used talk last war. Pretty soon I made they would hove aboard together press-gangs, left sort ‘emselves. The ship she Embuscade, thirty-six-gun Republican frigate, Captain Jean Baptiste Bompard, two days Le Havre, going United States Republican French Ambassador name Genet. They night clearing action account hearing guns fog. Uncle Aurette Captain Giddens must passing time day Newhaven, frigate drifted past ‘them. She never knew she would run smack. Seeing many aboard total strangers other, I thought one might not noticed; I put Aunt Cecile’s red cap back head, hands pockets like rest, and, French say, I circulated till I found galley. ‘“What! Here is one ‘them is not sick!” says cook. “Take his breakfast Citizen Bompard.” ‘I carried tray cabin, I did not call Bompard “Citizen.” Oh no! “Mon Capitaine” little word, Uncle Aurette used answer King Louis’ Navy. Bompard, he liked it. He took cabin servant, one asked questions; thus I got good victuals light work way across America. He talked heap politics, his officers, Ambassador Genet got rid his land-stomach laid law dinner, rooks’ parliament nothing compared cabin. I learned know men worked French Revolution, waiting table hearing talk ‘them. One forecas’le six-pounders called Danton t’other Marat. I used play fiddle ‘them, sitting capstan. Day day Bompard Monsieur Genet talked France done, United States going join her finish English war. Monsieur Genet said he would justabout make United States fight France. He rude common man. But I liked listening. I always helped drink healths proposed--specially Citizen Danton’s who would cut King Louis’ head. An all-Englishman might shocked--but that is French blood saved me. ‘It did not save getting dose ship’s fever though, week put Monsieur Genet ashore Charleston; left bleeding pills took dumb horrors living ‘tween decks. The surgeon, Karaguen his name was, kept help his plasters--I weak wait Bompard. I do not remember much account next weeks, till I smelled lilacs, I looked port, moored wharf-edge town fine gardens red-brick houses green leaves God’s world waiting outside. ‘“What is this?” I said sick-bay man--Old Pierre Tiphaigne he was. “Philadelphia,” says Pierre. “You have missed all. We are sailing next week.” ‘I turned round cried longing amongst laylocks. ‘“If that is trouble,” says old Pierre, “you go straight ashore. None’ll hinder you. They are gone mad coasts--French American together. ‘Tisn’t notion war.” Pierre old King Louis man. ‘My legs pretty tottly, I made shift go deck, like fair. The frigate crowded fine gentlemen ladies pouring out. They sung waved French flags, Captain Bompard his officers--yes, men--speechified sundry war England. They shouted, “Down England!”--“Down Washington!”--“Hurrah France Republic!” I could not make sense it. I wanted get crunch swords petticoats sit field. One gentlemen said me, “Is genuine cap Liberty you are wearing?” ‘It Was Aunt Cecile’s red one, pretty near wore out. “Oh yes!” I says, “straight France.” “I will give shilling it,” he says, money hand fiddle arm I squeezed past entry-port went ashore. It like dream--meadows, trees, flowers, birds, houses, people different! I sat meadow fiddled bit, I went streets, looking smelling touching, like little dog fair. Fine folk setting white stone doorsteps houses, girl threw handful laylock sprays, I said “Merci” without thinking, she said she loved French. They fashion city. I saw tricolour flags Philadelphia ever I would seen Boulogne, every one shouting war England. A crowd folk cheering French Ambassador--that Monsieur Genet we would left Charleston. He a-horseback behaving place belonged him--and commanding sundry fight British. But I would heard before. I got long straight street wide Broyle, gentlemen racing horses. I am fond horses. Nobody hindered ‘them, man told called Race Street purpose that. Then I followed black niggers, I would never seen close before; I left run great, proud, copper-faced man feathers his hair red blanket trailing behind him. A man told he real Red Indian called Red Jacket, I followed alley-way Race Street Second Street, fiddle playing. I am fond fiddling. The Indian stopped baker’s shop--Conrad Gerhard’s was--and bought sugary cakes. Hearing price I going too, Indian asked English I hungry. “Oh yes!” I says. I must looked sore scrattel. He opens door staircase leads way up. We walked dirty little room full flutes fiddles fat man fiddling window, smell cheese medicines fit knock down. I knocked too, fat man jumped hit smack face. I fell old spinet covered pill-boxes pills rolled floor. The Indian never moved eyelid. ‘“Pick pills! Pick pills!” fat man screeches. ‘I started picking ‘them up--hundreds ‘them--meaning run Indian’s arm, I came giddy I sat down. The fat man went back his fiddling. ‘“Toby!” says Indian quite while. “I brought boy fed, hit.” ‘“What?” says Toby, “I thought Gert Schwankfelder.” He put his fiddle took good look me. “Himmel!” he says. “I hit wrong boy. It new boy. Why new boy? Why Gert Schwankfelder?” ‘“I do not know,” I said. “The gentleman pink blanket brought me.” ‘Says Indian, “He hungry, Toby. Christians always feed hungry. So I bring him.” ‘“You said first,” said Toby. He pushed plates Indian put bread pork them, glass Madeira wine. I told I French ship, I joined account mother French. That true enough think it, besides I saw French fashion Philadelphia. Toby Indian whispered I went picking pills. ‘“You like pills--eh?” says Toby. “No,” I says. “I have seen ship’s doctor roll many them.” ‘“Ho!” he says, he shoves two bottles me. “What is those?” ‘“Calomel,” I says. “And t’other’s senna.” ‘“Right,” he says. “One week I tried teach Gert Schwankfelder difference them, yet he cannot tell. You like fiddle?” he says. He would seen kit floor. ‘“Oh yes!” says I. ‘“Oho!” he says. “What note this?” drawing his bow across. ‘He meant A, I told was. ‘“My brother,” he says Indian. “I think hand Providence! I warned Gert he went play upon wharves he would hear me. Now look boy say think.” ‘The Indian looked whole minutes--there musical clock wall dolls came hopped hour struck. He looked it. ‘“Good,” he says last. “This boy good.” ‘“Good, then,” says Toby. “Now I shall play fiddle shall sing hymn, brother. Boy, go bakery tell young Gert Schwankfelder was. The horses Davy jones’s locker. If ask questions shall hear me.” ‘I left ‘them singing hymns I went old Conrad Gerhard. He was not surprised I told I young Gert Schwankfelder was. He knew Toby. His wife she walked back-yard without word, she washed she cut hair edge basin, she put bed, oh! I slept--how I slept little room behind oven looking flower garden! I did not know Toby went Embuscade night bought Dr Karaguen twelve dollars dozen bottles Seneca Oil. Karaguen wanted new lace his coat, he reckoned I had not long live; he put “discharged sick.” ‘I like Toby,’ said Una. ‘Who he?’ said Puck. ‘Apothecary Tobias Hirte,’ Pharaoh replied. ‘One Hundred Eighteen, Second Street--the famous Seneca Oil man, lived half every year among Indians. But let tell tale way, his brown mare used go Lebanon.’ ‘Then he keep her Davy Jones’s locker?’ Dan asked. ‘That his joke. He kept her David Jones’s hat shop “Buck” tavern yard, his Indian friends kept ponies visited him. I looked horses I was not rolling pills top old spinet, he played his fiddle Red Jacket sang hymns. I liked it. I good victuals, light work, suit clean clothes, plenty music, quiet, smiling German folk around let sit gardens. My first Sunday, Toby took his church Moravian Alley; garden too. The women wore long-eared caps handkerchiefs. They came one door men another, brass chandelier could see face in, nigger-boy blow organ bellows. I carried Toby’s fiddle, he played pretty much he chose organ singing. He one let it, simple-minded folk. They used wash other’s feet attic keep ‘emselves humble: Lord knows did not need.’ ‘How queer!’ said Una. Pharaoh’s eyes twinkled. ‘I have met many seen much,’ he said; ‘but I have not yet found better quieter forbearinger people Brethren Sistern Moravian Church Philadelphia. Nor I ever forget first Sunday--the service English week--with smell flowers coming Pastor Meder’s garden big peach tree is, looking clean strangeness thinking ‘tween decks Embuscade six days ago. Being boy, seemed lasted ever, going ever. But I did not know Toby then. As soon dancing clock struck midnight Sunday--I lying spinet--I heard Toby’s fiddle. He would done his supper, he always took late heavy. “Gert,” says he, “get horses. Liberty Independence Ever! The flowers appear upon earth, time singing birds come. We going country seat Lebanon.” ‘I rubbed eyes, fetched ‘them “Buck” stables. Red Jacket saddling his, I would packed saddle-bags three rode Race Street Ferry starlight. So went travelling. It is kindly, softly country there, back Philadelphia among German towns, Lancaster way. Little houses bursting big barns, fat cattle, fat women, peaceful Heaven might farmed there. Toby sold medicines his saddlebags, gave French war-news folk along roads. Him his long-hilted umberell well known stage-coaches. He took orders famous Seneca Oil he secret Red Jacket’s Indians, he slept friends’ farmhouses, he would shut windows; Red Jacket slept outside. There is nothing hurt except snakes--and slip away quick enough thrash bushes.’ ‘I would liked that!’ said Dan. ‘I would fault find days. In cool morning cat-bird sings. He is something listen to. And there is smell wild grape-vine growing damp hollows drop into, long rides heat, beyond compare sweetness. So is puffs pine woods afternoons. Come sundown, frogs strike up, later fireflies dance corn. Oh me, fireflies corn! We week ten days road, tacking one place another--such Lancaster, Bethlehem-Ephrata--“thou Bethlehem-Ephrata.” No odds--I loved going about. And jogged ‘into dozy little Lebanon Blue Mountains, Toby cottage garden fruits. He come north every year wonderful Seneca Oil Seneca Indians made him. They would never sell one else, he doctored ‘them von Swieten pills, valued oil. He could he chose them, and, course, he tried make Moravians. The Senecas seemly, quiet people, they would trouble enough white men--American English--during wars, keep ‘them walk. They lived Reservation away lake. Toby took there, treated I blood brother. Red Jacket said mark bare feet dust like Indian’s style walking similar. I know I took ways over.’ ‘Maybe gipsy drop blood helped you?’ said Puck. ‘Sometimes I think did,’ Pharaoh went on. ‘Anyhow, Red Jacket Cornplanter, Seneca chief, let adopted tribe. It is compliment, course, Toby angry I showed face painted. They gave side-name means “Two Tongues,” because, d’ye see, I talked French English. ‘They opinions (I have heard ‘them) French English, Americans. They would suffered ‘them wars, wished left alone. But thought heap President United States. Cornplanter dealings French wars West General Washington lad. His President afterwards made odds ‘them. They always called Big Hand, he large-fisted man, he notion white chief. Cornplanter ‘ud sweep his blanket round him, I would filled his pipe he would begin--“In old days, long ago, braves many blankets few, Big Hand said-” If Red Jacket agreed say-so he would trickle little smoke corners his mouth. If he did not, he would blow his nostrils. Then Cornplanter ‘ud stop Red Jacket ‘ud take on. Red Jacket better talker two. I have laid listened ‘them hours. Oh! knew General Washington well. Cornplanter used meet Epply’s--the great dancing-place city District Marshal William Nichols bought it. They told he always glad see ‘them, he would hear ‘them end anything minds. They good deal days. I came degrees, I adopted tribe. The talk Lebanon everywhere else summer French war England whether United States ‘ud join France make peace treaty England. Toby wanted peace he could go Reservation buying his oils. But white men wished war, angry President would not give sign it. The newspaper said men burning Guy Fawkes images General Washington yelling streets Philadelphia. You would astonished two fine old chiefs knew ins outs matters. The little I have learned politics I picked Cornplanter Red Jacket Reservation. Toby used read Aurora newspaper. He call “Democrat,” though Church Brethren concerning politics.’ ‘I hate politics, too,’ said Una, Pharaoh laughed. ‘I might ha’ guessed it,’ he said. ‘But here is something is not politics. One hot evening late August, Toby reading newspaper stoop Red Jacket smoking peach tree I fiddling. Of sudden Toby drops his Aurora. ‘“I oldish man, fond comforts,” he says. “I go Church Philadelphia. My brother, lend spare pony. I must tomorrow night.” ‘“Good!” says Red Jacket, looking sun. “My brother shall there. I ride bring back ponies.” ‘I went pack saddle-bags. Toby cured asking questions. He stopped fiddling I did. Besides, Indians do not ask questions much I wanted like ‘them. ‘When horses ready I jumped up. ‘“Get off,” says Toby. “Stay mind cottage till I come back. The Lord laid me, you. I wish He had not.” ‘He powders Lancaster road, I sat doorstep wondering him. When I picked paper wrap his fiddle-strings in, I spelled piece yellow fever Philadelphia dreadful every one running away. I scared, I fond Toby. We never said much other, fiddled together, music’s good talking understand.’ ‘Did Toby die yellow fever?’ Una asked. ‘Not him! There is justice left world still. He went City bled ‘them well heaps. He sent back word Red Jacket that, war he died, I bring oils along City, till I go working garden Red Jacket see it. Down heart Indians reckon digging squaw’s business, neither Cornplanter, he relieved watch, hard task-Master. We hired nigger-boy work, lazy grinning runagate he was. When I found Toby did not die minute he reached town, why, boylike, I took mind went Indians again. Oh! days north Canasedago, running races gambling Senecas, bee-hunting ‘in woods, fishing lake.’ Pharaoh sighed looked across water. ‘But it is best,’ he went suddenly, ‘after first frosts. You roll blanket find every leaf left green night turned red yellow, trees time, hundreds hundreds miles ‘them, like sunsets splattered upside down. On one days--the maples flaming scarlet gold, sumach bushes redder--Cornplanter Red Jacket came full war-dress, making leaves look silly: feathered war-bonnets, yellow doeskin leggings, fringed tasselled, red horse-blankets, bridles feathered shelled beaded bounds. I thought war British till I saw faces were not painted, carried wrist-whips. Then I hummed “Yankee Doodle” ‘them. They told going visit Big Hand find sure whether he meant join French fighting English make peace treaty England. I reckon two would ha’ gone war-path nod Big Hand, knew well, war ‘twixt England United States, tribe ‘ud catch parties wars. They asked come along hold ponies. That puzzled me, always put ponies “Buck” Epply’s went see General Washington city, horse-holding nigger’s job. Besides, I was not exactly dressed it.’ ‘D’you mean dressed like Indian?’ Dan demanded. Pharaoh looked little abashed. ‘This did not happen Lebanon,’ he said, ‘but bit farther north, Reservation; particular moment time, far blanket, hair-band, moccasins, sunburn went, was not much odds ‘twix’ young Seneca buck. You may laugh’--he smoothed his long-skirted brown coat--‘but I told I took ways over. I said nothing, though I bursting let war-whoop like young men taught me.’ ‘No, do not let one here, either,’ said Puck Dan could ask. ‘Go on, Brother Square-toes.’ ‘We went on.’ Pharaoh’s narrow dark eyes gleamed danced. ‘We went on--forty, fifty miles day, days end--we three braves. And great tall Indian a-horse-back carry his war-bonnet canter thick timber without brushing feather beats me! My silly head banged often enough low branches, slipped like running elk. We evening hymn-singing every night they would blown pipe-smoke quarters heaven. Where go? I will tell you, do not blame you are wiser. We took old war-trail end Lake along East Susquehanna Nantego country, right Fort Shamokin Senachse river. We crossed Juniata Fort Granville, got Shippensberg hills Ochwick trail, Williams Ferry (it is bad one). From Williams Ferry, across Shanedore, Blue Mountains, Ashby’s Gap, south-east south there, till found President back his plantations. I would hate trailed Indians earnest. They caught like partridge stump. After we would left ponies, scouted forward woody piece, and, creeping slower slower, last moccasins even slipped Red Jacket ‘ud turn frown. I heard voices--Monsieur Genet’s choice--long I saw anything, pulled edge clearing niggers grey-and-red liveries holding horses, half-a-dozen gentlemen--but one Genet--were talking among felled timber. I fancy they would come see Genet piece his road, his portmantle him. I hid two logs near company I old windlass there. I did not need anybody show Big Hand. He stood up, still, his legs little apart, listening Genet, French Ambassador, never manners Bosham tinker. Genet good ordering declare war England once. I heard clack Embuscade. He said he would stir whole United States war England, whether Big Hand liked not. ‘Big Hand heard last end. I looked behind me, two chiefs vanished like smoke. Says Big Hand, “That forcibly put, Monsieur Genet--” ‘“Citizen--citizen!” fellow spits in. “I, least, Republican!” “Citizen Genet,” he says, “you may sure receive fullest consideration.” This seemed take Citizen Genet back piece. He rode grumbling, never gave his nigger penny. No gentleman! ‘The others assembled round Big Hand then, and, way, said pretty much Genet said. They put him, France England war, manner speaking, right across United States’ stomach, paying regards one. The French searching American ships pretence helping England, really steal goods. The English same, t’other way round, besides searching, pressing American citizens Navy help fight France, pretence Americans lawful British subjects. His gentlemen put clear Big Hand. It did not look them, said, though United States trying keep fight advantage her, she catched French English. They said nine ten good Americans crazy fight English there. They would not say whether right wrong; wanted Big Hand turn his mind. He did--for while. I saw Red Jacket Cornplanter watching far side clearing, slipped round another mystery. Then Big Hand drew up, he let his gentlemen it.’ ‘Hit ‘them?’ Dan asked. ‘No, yet might call swearing. He--he blasted ‘them his natural speech. He asked half-a-dozen times whether United States enough armed ships shape sort war one. He asked ‘them, thought she ships, give ships, looked ground, expected find ‘them there. He put ‘them whether, setting ships aside, country--I reckon he gave ‘them good reasons--whether United States ready able face new big war; she years back wound one England, holds full her troubles. As I said, strong way he laid ‘them blasted ‘them, he would done like still woods storm. A little man--but looked little--pipes like young rook blowed-down nest, “Nevertheless, General, seems compelled fight England.” Quick Big Hand wheeled him, “And anything past makes think I averse fighting Great Britain?” ‘Everybody laughed except him. “Oh, General, mistake us entirely!” says. “I trust so,” he says. “But I know duty. We must peace England.” ‘“At price?” says man rook’s voice. ‘“At price,” says he, word word. “Our ships searched--our citizens pressed, but--” ‘“Then Declaration Independence?” says one. ‘“Deal facts, fancies,” says Big Hand. “The United States position fight England.” ‘“But think public opinion,” another one starts up. “The feeling Philadelphia alone fever heat.” ‘He held one his big hands. “Gentlemen,” he says--slow he spoke, his voice carried far--“I think country. Let assure treaty Great Britain made though every city Union burn effigy.” ‘“At price?” actor-like chap keeps croaking. ‘“The treaty must made Great Britain’s terms. What else I do?” ‘He turns his back ‘them looked slinked horses, leaving alone: I saw he old man. Then Red Jacket Cornplanter rode clearing far end though chanced along. Back went Big Hand’s shoulders, went his head, he stepped forward one single pace great deep Hough! pleased he was. That statelified meeting behold--three big men, two ‘them looking like jewelled images among spattle gay-coloured leaves. I saw chiefs’ war-bonnets sinking together, down. Then made sign Indian makes outside Medicine Lodges--a sweep right hand clear dust inbend left knee time, proud eagle feathers almost touched his boot-top.’ ‘What mean?’ said Dan. ‘Mean!’ Pharaoh cried. ‘Why it is you--what we--it is Sachems’ way sprinkling sacred corn-meal front of--oh! it is piece Indian compliment really, signifies big chief. ‘Big Hand looked ‘them. First he says quite softly, “My brothers know easy chief.” Then his voice grew. “My children,” says he, “what minds?” ‘Says Cornplanter, “We came ask whether war King George’s men, heard Father said his chiefs. We carry away talk hearts tell people.” ‘“No,” says Big Hand. “Leave talk behind--it white men only--but take message people--‘There war.’” ‘His gentlemen waiting, did not delay him-, Cornplanter says, using his old side-name, “Big Hand, see us among timber now?” ‘“Surely,” says he. “You taught look behind trees young.” And he cantered off. ‘Neither chiefs spoke till back ponies half-hour along home-trail. Then Cornplanter says Red Jacket, “We Corn-dance year. There war.” And it.’ Pharaoh stood though he finished. ‘Yes,’ said Puck, rising too. ‘And came long run?’ ‘Let get story way,’ answer. ‘Look! it is later I thought. That Shoreham smack’s thinking her supper.’ The children looked across darkening Channel. A smack hoisted lantern slowly moved west Brighton pier lights ran twinkling line.

An ill way--a chill way--the ice begins crack. But far gentlemen never took advice. (When cannot go forward must e’en come back!) How far St Helena field Waterloo? A near way--a clear way--the ship take soon. A pleasant place gentlemen little left do. (Morning never tries till afternoon!) How far St Helena Gate Heaven’s Grace? That one knows--that one knows--and one ever will. But fold hands across heart cover face, And trapesings, child, lie still! ‘A Priest Spite Himself’ The day came home sea-side set tour inspection make sure everything left it. Soon discovered old Hobden blocked best hedge-gaps stakes thorn-bundles, trimmed hedges blackberries setting. ‘It cannot time gipsies come along,’ said Una. ‘Why, summer day!’ ‘There is smoke Low Shaw!’ said Dan, sniffing. ‘Let us make sure!’ They crossed fields towards thin line blue smoke leaned hollow Low Shaw lies beside King’s Hill road. It used old quarry till somebody planted it, look straight edge Banky Meadow. ‘I thought so,’ Dan whispered, came fence edge larches. A gipsy-van--not show-man’s sort, old black kind, little windows high baby-gate across door--was getting ready leave. A man harnessing horses; old woman crouched ashes fire made broken fence-rails; girl sat van-steps singing baby her lap. A wise-looking, thin dog snuffed patch fur ground till old woman put carefully middle fire. The girl reached back inside van tossed her paper parcel. This laid fire too, smelt singed feathers. ‘Chicken feathers!’ said Dan. ‘I wonder old Hobden’s.’ Una sneezed. The dog growled crawled girl’s feet, old woman fanned fire her hat, man led horses shafts, They moved quickly quietly snakes moss. ‘Ah!’ said girl. ‘I will teach you!’ She beat dog, seemed expect it. ‘Do not that,’ Una called down. ‘It was not his fault.’ ‘How know I am beating for?’ she answered. ‘For seeing us,’ said Dan. ‘He standing right smoke, wind wrong his nose, anyhow.’ The girl stopped beating dog, old woman fanned faster ever. ‘You have fanned feathers fire,’ said Una. ‘There is tail-feather chestnut-tot.’ ‘What it?’ said old woman, she grabbed it. ‘Oh, nothing!’ said Dan. ‘Only I have heard say tail-feathers bad whole bird, sometimes.’ That saying Hobden’s pheasants. Old Hobden always burned feather fur he sat eat. ‘Come on, mother,’ man whispered. The old woman climbed van, horses drew deep-rutted shaw hard road. The girl waved her hands shouted something could catch. ‘That gipsy “Thank kindly, Brother Sister,”’ said Pharaoh Lee. He standing behind them, his fiddle his arm. ‘Gracious, startled me!’ said Una. ‘You startled old Priscilla Savile,’ Puck called them. ‘Come sit fire. She ought put left.’ They dropped ferny side shaw. Una raked ashes together, Dan found dead wormy oak branch burns without flame, watched smoke Pharaoh played curious wavery air. ‘That is girl humming baby,’ said Una. ‘I know it,’ he nodded, went on: ‘Ai Lumai, Lumai, Lumai! Luludia! Ai Luludia!’ He passed one odd tune another, quite forgot children. At last Puck asked go his adventures Philadelphia among Seneca Indians. ‘I am telling it,’ he said, staring straight front he played. ‘Cannot hear?’ ‘Maybe, cannot. Tell aloud,’ said Puck. Pharaoh shook himself, laid his fiddle beside him, began: ‘I would left Red Jacket Cornplanter riding home Big Hand said would not war. That is it. We believed Big Hand went home again--we three braves. When reached Lebanon found Toby cottage his waistcoat foot big him--so hard he worked amongst yellow-fever people. He beat running Indians, ‘it was worth it--I glad see him,--and went back Philadelphia winter, I told he would sacrificed sick people yellow fever, I thought world him. No, I did not neither. I would thought along. That yellow fever must something dreadful. Even December people begun trinkle back town. Whole houses stood empty niggers robbing out. But I cannot call mind Moravian Brethren died. It seemed like kept concerns, good Lord He would looked ‘them. That winter--yes, winter ‘Ninety-three--the Brethren bought stove church. Toby spoke favour cold spoiled his fiddle hand, many thought stove-heat Bible, yet third party always brought hickory coal foot-warmers service would not speak either way. They ended casting Lot it, like pitch-and-toss. After summer Senecas, church-stoves did not highly interest me, I took haunting round among French emigres Philadelphia full of. My French fiddling helped there, d’ye see. They come shiploads France, where, I made out, every one killing every one else means, spread ‘emselves city--mostly Drinker’s Alley Elfrith’s Alley--and odd jobs till times mend. But whatever stooped to, gentry kept cheerful countenance, evening’s fiddling one poor little proud parties, Brethren seemed old-fashioned. Pastor Meder Brother Adam Goos did not like fiddling hire, Toby said lawful earn living exercising talents. He never let put upon. ‘In February ‘Ninety-four--No, March must been, new Ambassador called Faucher come France, manners Genet old one--in March, Red Jacket came Reservation bringing news kind friends there. I showed round city, saw General Washington riding crowd folk shouted war England. They gave quite rough music, he looked ‘twixt his horse’s ears made notice. His stirrup brished Red Jacket’s elbow, Red Jacket whispered up, “My brother knows easy chief.” Big Hand shot one look nodded. Then scuffle behind us one was not hooting Washington loud enough please people. We went away fight. Indians will not risk hit.’ ‘What are?’ Dan asked. ‘Kill, course. That is proper manners. Well, then, coming home Drinker’s Alley get new shirt French Vicomte’s lady washing take stiff (I am always choice body-linen) lame Frenchman pushes paper buttons us. He had not long landed United States, please would buy. He sure-ly pitiful scrattel--his coat half torn off, his face cut, his hands steady; I knew was not drink. He said his name Peringuey, he would knocked crowd round Stadt--Independence Hall. One thing leading another took Toby’s rooms, Red Jacket taken year before. The compliments he paid Toby’s Madeira wine fairly conquered old man, he opened second bottle he told Monsieur Peringuey great stove dispute church. I remember Pastor Meder Brother Adam Goos dropped ‘in, although Toby direct opposite sides regarding stoves, yet Monsieur Peringuey he made ‘them feel he thought one right it. He said he clergyman he leave France. He admired Toby’s fiddling, he asked Red Jacket, sitting spinet, simple Huron. Senecas are not Hurons, they are Iroquois, course, Toby told so. Well, then, due time he arose left style made us feel he would favouring us, instead us feeding him. I have never seen strong before--in man. We talked could not make head tail him, Red Jacket come walk French quarter I due fiddle party. Passing Drinker’s Alley saw naked window light it, sat button-selling Monsieur Peringuey throwing dice alone, right hand left. ‘Says Red Jacket, keeping back dark, “Look his face!” ‘I looking. I protest I was not frightened like I Big Hand talked his gentlemen. I--I looked, I wondered even dead dumb dice ‘ud dare fall different face wished. It--it face! ‘“He bad,” says Red Jacket. “But he great chief. The French sent away great chief. I thought he told us his lies. Now I know.” ‘I go party, I asked call round afterwards we would hymn-singing Toby’s usual. “No,” he says. “Tell Toby I Christian tonight. All Indian.” He fits sometimes. I wanted know Monsieur Peringuey, emigre party place find out. It is neither there, course, French emigre parties almost make cry. The men bought fruit Market Street, hairdressers fencing-masters French teachers, turn back candlelight used home, catch real names. There was not much room washhouse, I sat top copper played ‘them tunes called for--“Si le Roi m’avait donne,” nursery stuff. They cried sometimes. It hurt take money afterwards, indeed did. And I found Monsieur Peringuey. He proper rogue too! None ‘them good word except Marquise kept French boarding-house Fourth Street. I made his real name Count Talleyrand de Perigord--a priest right enough, sorely come world. He would King Louis’ Ambassador England year two back, French cut King Louis’ head; and, I heard, head was not hardly hanging loose he would run back Paris prevailed Danton, man murder, send back England Ambassador French Republic! That much English, kicked Act Parliament, he would fled Americas without money friends prospects. I am telling talk washhouse. Some ‘them laughing it. Says French Marquise, “My friends, laugh soon. That man ‘ll winning side us.” ‘“I know fond priests, Marquise,” says Vicomte. His lady washing, I have told you. ‘“I reasons,” says Marquise. “He sent uncle two brothers Heaven little door,”--that one emigre names guillotine. “He winning side costs blood every friend he world.” ‘“Then he want here?” says one ‘them. “We lost game.” ‘“My faith!” says Marquise. “He find out, one can, whether canaille Washington means help us fight England. Genet” (that Ambassador Embuscade) “has failed gone disgraced; Faucher” (he new man) “has not done better, Abbe find out, he make his profit news. Such man fall.” ‘“He begins unluckily,” says Vicomte. “He set upon today street hooting Washington.” They laughed again, one remarks, “How poor devil keep himself?” ‘He must slipped washhouse door, he flits past joins ‘them, cold ice. ‘“One one can,” he says. “I sell buttons. And you, Marquise?” ‘“I?”--she waves her poor white hands burned--“I cook--a bad one--at service, Abbe. We talking you.” They did not treat like talked him. They backed stood still. ‘“I missed something, then,” he says. “But I spent last hour playing--only buttons, Marquise--against noble savage, veritable Huron himself.” ‘“You usual luck, I hope?” she says. ‘“Certainly,” he says. “I cannot afford lose even buttons days.” ‘“Then I suppose child nature know dice usually loaded, Father Tout-a-tous,” she continues. I do not know whether she meant accuse cheating. He bows. ‘“Not yet, Mademoiselle Cunegonde,” he says, goes make agreeable rest company. And I found Monsieur Peringuey Count Charles Maurice Talleyrand de Perigord.’ Pharaoh stopped, children said nothing. ‘You have heard him?’ said Pharaoh. Una shook her head. ‘Was Red Jacket Indian he played dice with?’ Dan asked. ‘He was. Red Jacket told next time met. I asked lame man cheated. Red Jacket said no--he played quite fair master player. I allow Red Jacket knew. I have seen him, Reservation, play everything he again. Then I told Red Jacket I would heard party concerning Talleyrand. ‘“I right,” he says. “I saw man’s war-face he thought he alone. That is I played him. I played face face. He is great chief. Do say he comes here?” ‘“They say he comes find Big Hand makes war English,” I said. ‘Red Jacket grunted. “Yes,” he says. “He asked too. If he small chief I lied. But he great chief. He knew I chief, I told truth. I told Big Hand said Cornplanter clearing--‘There war.’ I could see he thought. I could see behind his face. But he great chief. He believe.” ‘“Will he believe Big Hand keep his people back war?” I said, thinking crowds hooted Big Hand whenever he rode out. ‘“He bad Big Hand good, he strong Big Hand,” says Red Jacket. “When he talks Big Hand he feel his heart. The French sent away great chief. Presently he go back make afraid.” ‘Now was not comical? The French woman knew owed her losses him; Indian picked up, cut muddy street, played dice him; neither ‘them doubted Talleyrand something himself--appearances notwithstanding.’ ‘And he something himself?’ asked Una. Pharaoh began laugh, stopped. ‘The way I look it,’ he said, ‘Talleyrand one three men world quite themselves. Big Hand I put first, I have seen him.’ ‘Ay,’ said Puck. ‘I am sorry lost Old England. Who d’you put second?’ ‘Talleyrand: maybe I have seen too,’ said Pharaoh. ‘Who is third?’ said Puck. ‘Boney--even though I have seen him.’ ‘Whew!’ said Puck. ‘Every man his weights measures, that is queer reckoning.’ ‘Boney?’ said Una. ‘You do not mean you have ever met Napoleon Bonaparte?’ ‘There, I knew would not patience rest tale hearing that! But wait minute. Talleyrand he come round Hundred Eighteen day two thank Toby his kindness. I did not mention dice-playing, I could see Red Jacket’s doings made Talleyrand highly curious Indians--though he would call Huron. Toby, may believe, holds full knowledge concerning manners habits. He needed listener. The Brethren do not study Indians much till join Church, Toby knew ‘them wild. So evening evening Talleyrand crossed his sound leg his game one Toby poured forth. Having adopted Senecas I, naturally, kept still, Toby ‘ud call back his remarks, means, habit he drawing talk, Talleyrand saw I knew something his noble savages too. Then he tried trick. Coming back emigre party he turns his little shop puts me, laughing like, I would gone two chiefs visit Big Hand. I had not told. Red Jacket had not told, Toby, course, did not know. ‘It Was Talleyrand’s guess. “Now,” he says, “my English Red Jacket’s French bad I sure I got rights President really said unsophisticated Huron. Do favour telling again.” I told every word Red Jacket told one word more. I suspicions, come emigre party Marquise hating praising usual. ‘“Much obliged,” he said. “But I could not gather Red Jacket exactly President said Monsieur Genet, his American gentlemen Monsieur Genet ridden away.” ‘I saw Talleyrand guessing again, Red Jacket had not told word white men’s pow-wow.’ ‘Why had not he?’ Puck asked. ‘Because Red Jacket chief. He told Talleyrand President said Cornplanter; he did not repeat talk, white men, Big Hand ordered leave behind. ‘Oh!’ said Puck. ‘I see. What do?’ ‘First I going make sort tale round it, Talleyrand chief too. So I said, “As soon I get Red Jacket’s permission tell part tale, I will delighted refresh memory, Abbe.” What else could I done? ‘“Is all?” he says, laughing. “Let refresh memory. In month I give hundred dollars account conversation.” ‘“Make five hundred, Abbe,” I says. ‘“Five, then,” says he. ‘“That suit admirably,” I says. “Red Jacket town then, moment he gives leave I will claim money.” ‘He hard fight civil, he come smiling. ‘“Monsieur,” he says, “I beg pardon sincerely I envy noble Huron loyalty. Do honour sit I explain.” ‘There was not another chair, I sat button-box. ‘He clever man. He got hold gossip President meant make peace treaty England cost. He found out--from Genet, I reckon, President day two chiefs met him. He would heard Genet huff President ridden leaving his business loose ends. What he wanted--what he begged blustered know--was words President said his gentlemen Genet left, concerning peace treaty England. He put helping words I would helping three great countries well mankind. The room bare palm hand, I could not laugh him. ‘“I am sorry,” I says, he wiped his forehead. “As soon Red Jacket gives permission--” ‘“You do not believe me, then?” he cuts in. ‘“Not one little, little word, Abbe,” I says; “except mean winning side. Remember, I have fiddling old friends months.” ‘Well, his temper fled he called names. ‘“Wait minute, ci-devant,” I says last. “I half English half French, I half man. I tell thee something Indian told me. Has thee seen President?” ‘“Oh yes!” he sneers. “I letters Lord Lansdowne estimable old man.” ‘“Then,” I says, “thee understand. The Red Skin said thee met President thee feel thy heart he stronger man thee.” ‘“Go!” he whispers. “Before I kill thee, go.” ‘He looked like it. So I left him.’ ‘Why he want know badly?’ said Dan. ‘The way I look he known certain Washington meant make peace treaty England price, he would ha’ left old Faucher fumbling Philadelphia he went straight back France told old Danton--“It is good wasting time hopes United States, she will not fight side--that I have proof of!” Then Danton might grateful given Talleyrand job, whole mass things hang knowing sure who is friend who is enemy. Just think us poor shop-keepers, instance.’ ‘Did Red Jacket let tell, he came back?’ Una asked. ‘Of course not. He said, “When Cornplanter I ask Big Hand said whites tell Lame Chief. All talk left behind timber, Big Hand ordered. Tell Lame Chief war. He go back France word.” ‘Talleyrand had not met long time except emigre parties. When I give message he shook his head. He sorting buttons shop. ‘“I cannot return France nothing better word unsophisticated savage,” he says. ‘“Has not President said anything you?” I asked him. ‘“He said everything one his position ought say, but--but I he said his Cabinet Genet rode I believe I could change Europe--the world, maybe.” ‘“I am sorry,” I says. “Maybe you will without help.” ‘He looked hard. “Either unusual observation one young, choose insolent,” he says. ‘“It intended compliment,” I says. “But odds. We are days summer trip, I have come make good-byes.” ‘“I go travels too,” he says. “If ever meet may sure I best repay I owe you.” ‘“Without malice, Abbe, I hope,” I says. ‘“None whatever,” says he. “Give respects adorable Dr Pangloss” (that one his side-names Toby) “and Huron.” I never could teach difference betwixt Hurons Senecas. ‘Then Sister Haga came paper call “pilly buttons,” last I saw Talleyrand parts.’ ‘But met Napoleon, did not you?’ said Una. ‘Wait Just little, dearie. After that, Toby I went Lebanon Reservation, and, older knowing better manage him, I enjoyed well summer fiddling fun. When came back, Brethren got Toby I was not learning lawful trade, he hard work save apprenticed Helmbold Geyer printers. ‘Twould ruined music together, indeed would. And escaped that, old Mattes Roush, leather-breeches maker round corner, took notion I cut skin-dressing. But rescued. Along towards Christmas comes big sealed letter Bank saying Monsieur Talleyrand put five hundred dollars--a hundred pounds--to credit use I pleased. There little note inside--he did not give address--to thank past kindnesses believing his future, he said pretty cloudy time writing. I wished Toby share money. I had not done bring Talleyrand Hundred Eighteen. The kindnesses Toby’s. But Toby said, “No! Liberty Independence ever. I wants, son.” So I gave set new fiddle-strings, Brethren did not advise us more. Only Pastor Meder he preached deceitfulness riches, Brother Adam Goos said war English ‘ud surely shoot Bank. I knew was not going war, I drew money Red Jacket’s advice I put horse-flesh, I sold Bob Bicknell Baltimore stage-coaches. That way, I doubled money inside twelvemonth.’ ‘You gipsy! You proper gipsy!’ Puck shouted. ‘Why not? ‘It Was fair buying selling. Well, one thing leading another, years I made beginning worldly fortune tobacco trade.’ ‘Ah!’ said Puck, suddenly. ‘Might I inquire you would ever sent news people England--or France?’ ‘OF course I had. I wrote regular every three months I would made money horse trade. We Lees do not like coming home empty-handed. If it is turnip egg, it is something. Oh yes, I wrote good plenty Uncle Aurette, and--Dad do not read quickly--Uncle used slip Newhaven way tell Dad going tobacco trade.’ ‘I see-- Aurettes Lees-- Like two peas. Go on, Brother Square-toes,’ said Puck. Pharaoh laughed went on. ‘Talleyrand he would gone world me. He would sailed France again, great man Government awhile, turn account story bribes American shippers. All poor emigres said he surely finished time, Red Jacket did not think likely, unless he quite dead. Big Hand made his peace treaty Great Britain, he said he would, roaring trade ‘twixt England United States ‘ud take risk searched British French men-of-war. Those two fighting, his gentlemen told Big Hand ‘ud happen--the United States catching both. If English man-of-war met American ship he would press half best men her, swear British subjects. Most ‘them was! If Frenchman met her he would, likely, cargo her, swearing meant aid comfort English; Spaniard Dutchman met her--they hanging England’s coat-tails too--Lord knows would not do! It came I wanted tobacco trade fast-sailing ship man could French, English, American pinch. Luckily I could lay hands articles. So along towards end September year ‘Ninety-nine I sailed Philadelphia hundred eleven hogshead good Virginia tobacco, brig BERTHE AURETTE, named Mother’s maiden name, hoping ‘twould bring luck, she did not--and yet she did.’ ‘Where bound for?’ Puck asked. ‘Er--any port I found handiest. I did not tell Toby Brethren. They do not understand ins outs tobacco trade.’ Puck coughed small cough he shifted piece wood his bare foot. ‘It is easy sit judge,’ Pharaoh cried. ‘But think put with! We spread wings run across broad Atlantic like hen horse-fair. Even so, stopped English frigate, three days out. He sent boat alongside pressed seven able seamen. I remarked hard honest traders, officer said fighting creation had not time argue. The next English frigate escaped shot quarter. Then chased two days night French privateer, firing squalls, dirty little English ten-gun brig made sheer impudence press another five men. That is reached chops Channel. Twelve good men pressed thirty-five; eighteen-pound shot-hole close beside rudder; mainsail looking like spectacles Frenchman hit us--and Channel crawling short-handed British cruisers. Put pipe smoke next time grumble price tobacco! ‘Well, then, top off, trying get leaks, French lugger come swooping us dusk. We warned keep away, he fell aboard us, climbed his Jabbering red-caps. We could not endure more--indeed could not. We went ‘them could lay hands on. It did not last long. They fifty odd twenty-three. Pretty soon I heard cutlasses thrown one bellowed sacri captain. ‘“Here I am!” I says. “I do not suppose makes odds thieves, United States brig BERTHE AURETTE.” ‘“My aunt!” man says, laughing. “Why she named that?” ‘“Who is speaking?” I said. ‘It Was dark see, I thought I knew voice. ‘“Enseigne de Vaisseau Estephe L’Estrange,” he sings out, I sure. ‘“Oh!” I says. “It is family, I suppose, done fine day’s work, Stephen.” ‘He whips binnacle-light holds face. He young L’Estrange, full cousin, I had not seen since night smack sank Telscombe Tye--six years before. ‘“Whew!” he says. “That is she named Aunt Berthe, it? What is share her, Pharaoh?” ‘“Only half owner, cargo’s mine.” ‘“That is bad,” he says. “I will I can, should not fought us.” ‘“Steve,” I says, “you are not ever going report little fall-out fight! Why, Revenue cutter ‘ud laugh it!” ‘“So’d I I was not Republican Navy,” he says. “But two men dead, d’ye see, I am afraid I will take Prize Court Le Havre.” ‘“Will condemn ‘baccy?” I asks. ‘“To last ounce. But I thinking ship. She would make sweet little craft Navy Prize Court ‘ud let her,” he says. ‘Then I knew hope. I do not blame him--a man must consider his interests, nigh every dollar I ship cargo, Steve kept saying, “You should not fought us.” ‘Well, then, lugger took us Le Havre, one time want British ship rescue us, why, course never saw one. My cousin spoke his best us Prize Court. He owned he would right rush alongside face United States flag, could not get two men killed, d’ye see, Court condemned ship cargo. They kind enough make us prisoners--only beggars--and young L’Estrange given BERTHE AURETTE re-arm French Navy. ‘“I will take round Boulogne,” he says. “Mother rest’ll glad see you, slip Newhaven Uncle Aurette. Or ship me, like men, take turn King George’s loose trade. There is plenty pickings,” he says. ‘Crazy I was, I could not help laughing. ‘“I have allowance pickings stealings,” I says. “Where taking tobacco?” ‘It Was loaded barge. ‘“Up Seine sold Paris,” he says. “Neither I ever touch penny money.” ‘“Get leave go it,” I says. “I will see there is justice gotten American Ambassador.” ‘“There is much justice world,” he says, “without Navy.” But he got leave go barge he gave money. That tobacco I had, I followed like hound follows snatched bone. Going river I fiddled little keep spirits up, well make friends guard. They duty. Outside reasonablest God’s creatures. They never even laughed me. So come Paris, river, along November, French christened Brumaire. They would given new names months, outrageous silly piece business that, was not likely trouble ‘emselves rights wrongs. They did not. The barge laid Notre Dame church charge caretaker, he let sleep aboard I would run day office office, seeking justice fair dealing, getting speeches concerning liberty. None heeded me. Looking back I cannot rightly blame ‘them. I would money, clothes filthy mucked; I had not changed linen weeks, I would proof claims except ship’s papers, which, said, I might stolen. The thieves! The door-keeper American Ambassador--for I never saw even Secretary--he swore I spoke French sight well American citizen. Worse that--I spent money, d’ye see, I--I took fiddling streets keep; and--and, ship’s captain fiddle his arm--well, I do not blame ‘them did not believe me. ‘I come back barge one day--late month Brumaire was--fair beazled out. Old Maingon, caretaker, he would lit fire bucket grilling herring. ‘“Courage, mon ami,” he says. “Dinner served.” ‘“I cannot eat,” I says. “I cannot more. It is stronger I am.” ‘“Bah!” he says. “Nothing’s stronger man. Me, example! Less two years ago I blown Orient Aboukir Bay, I descended hit water like fairy. Look now,” he says. He was not much look at, he would one leg one eye, cheerfullest soul ever trod shoe-leather. “That is worse hundred eleven hogshead ‘baccy,” he goes on. “You are young, too! What would not I give young France hour! There is nothing could not do,” he says. “The ball’s feet--kick it!” he says. He kicks old fire-bucket his peg-leg. “General Buonaparte, example!” he goes on. “That man’s babe compared me, see he is done already. He is conquered Egypt Austria Italy--oh! half Europe!” he says, “and he sails back Paris, he sails St Cloud river here--do not stare river, young fool!---and front pig-jobbing lawyers citizens he makes Consul, good King. He will King, too, next three turns capstan--King France, England, world! Think that!” he shouts, “and eat herring.” ‘I says something Boney. If he had not fighting England I should not lost ‘baccy--should I? ‘“Young fellow,” says Maingon, “you do not understand.” ‘We heard cheering. A carriage passed bridge two it. ‘“That is man himself,” says Maingon. “He will give ‘them something cheer soon.” He stands salute. ‘“Who is t’other black beside him?” I asks, fairly shaking over. ‘“Ah! he is clever one. You will hear long. He is scoundrel-bishop, Talleyrand.” ‘“It is!” I said, steps I went fiddle, run carriage calling, “Abbe, Abbe!” ‘A soldier knocked wind back his sword, I sense keep following till carriage stopped--and crowd round house-door! I must half-crazy else I would not struck “Si le Roi m’avait donne Paris la grande ville!” I thought might remind him. ‘“That good omen!” he says Boney sitting hunched up; he looks straight me. ‘“Abbe--oh, Abbe!” I says. “Do not remember Toby Hundred Eighteen Second Street?” ‘He said word. He crooked his long white finger guard door carriage steps let down, I skipped house, slammed door crowd’s face. ‘“You go there,” says soldier, shoves empty room, I catched first breath since I would left barge. Presently I heard plates rattling next door--there folding doors between--and cork drawn. “I tell you,” one shouts his mouth full, “it sulky ass Sieyes’ fault. Only speech Five Hundred saved situation.” ‘“Did save coat?” says Talleyrand. “I hear tore threw out. Do not gasconade me. You may road victory, are not yet.” ‘Then I guessed t’other man Boney. He stamped swore Talleyrand. ‘“You forget yourself, Consul,” says Talleyrand, “or rather remember yourself--Corsican.” ‘“Pig!” says Boney, worse. ‘“Emperor!” says Talleyrand, but, way he spoke, sounded worst all. Some one must backed folding doors, flew open showed middle room. Boney whipped his pistol I could stand up. “General,” says Talleyrand him, “this gentleman habit catching us canaille en deshabille. Put thing down.” ‘Boney laid table, I guessed master. Talleyrand takes hand--“Charmed see again, Candide,” he says. “How adorable Dr Pangloss noble Huron?” ‘“They well I left,” I said. “But I am not.” ‘“Do sell buttons now?” he says, fills glass wine table. ‘“Madeira,” says he. “Not good I drunk.” ‘“You mountebank!” Boney roars. “Turn out.” (He did not even say “man,” Talleyrand, gentle born, went on.) ‘“Pheasant good pork,” he says. “You find table honour sit down. Pass clean plate, General.” And, true I am here, Boney slid plate along like sulky child. He lanky-haired, yellow-skinned little man, nervous cat--and dangerous. I could feel that. ‘“And now,” said Talleyrand, crossing his game leg his sound one, “will tell story?” ‘I fluster, I told nearly everything time he left five hundred dollars Philadelphia, losing ship cargo Le Havre. Boney began listening, bit he dropped his thoughts looked crowd sideways front-room curtains. Talleyrand called I would done. ‘“Eh? What need now,” says Boney, “is peace next three four years.” ‘“Quite so,” says Talleyrand. “Meantime I want Consul’s order Prize Court Le Havre restore friend his ship.” ‘“Nonsense!” says Boney. “Give away oak-built brig two hundred seven tons sentiment? Certainly not! She must armed Navy ten--no, fourteen twelve-pounders two long fours. Is she strong enough bear long twelve forward?” ‘Now I could ha’ sworn he would paid heed talk, wonderful head-piece his seemingly skimmed every word useful him. ‘“Ah, General!” says Talleyrand. “You magician--a magician without morals. But brig undoubtedly American, do not want offend have.” ‘“Need anybody talk affair?” he says. He did not look me, I knew his mind--just cold murder I worried him; he would order easy ordering his carriage. ‘“You cannot stop ‘them,” I said. “There is twenty-two men besides me.” I felt little ‘ud set screaming like wired hare. ‘“Undoubtedly American,” Talleyrand goes on. “You would gain something returned ship--with message fraternal good-will--published MONITEUR” (that is French paper like Philadelphia AURORA). ‘“A good idea!” Boney answers. “One could say much message.” ‘“It might useful,” says Talleyrand. “Shall I message prepared?” He wrote something little pocket ledger. ‘“Yes--for embellish evening. The MONITEUR publish tonight.” ‘“Certainly. Sign, please,” says Talleyrand, tearing leaf out. ‘“But that is order return brig,” says Boney. “Is necessary? Why I lose good ship? Have not I lost enough ships already?” ‘Talleyrand did not answer questions. Then Boney sidled table jabs his pen ink. Then he shies paper again: “My signature alone useless,” he says. “You must two Consuls well. Sieyes Roger Ducos must sign. We must preserve Laws.” ‘“By time friend presents it,” says Talleyrand, still looking window, “only one signature necessary.” ‘Boney smiles. “It is swindle,” says he, he signed pushed paper across. ‘“Give President Prize Court Le Havre,” says Talleyrand, “and he give back ship. I settle cargo myself. You told much cost. What profit expect make it?” ‘Well, then, man man, I bound warn I would set run England without troubling Revenue, I could not rightly set bounds profits.’ ‘I guessed along,’ said Puck. ‘There never Lee Warminghurst-- That was not smuggler last first.’ The children laughed. ‘It is comical enough now,’ said Pharaoh. ‘But I did not laugh then. Says Talleyrand minute, “I bad accountant I several calculations hand present. Shall say twice cost cargo?” ‘Say? I could not say word. I sat choking nodding like China image he wrote order his secretary pay me, I will not say much, would not believe it. ‘“Oh! Bless you, Abbe! God bless you!” I got last. ‘“Yes,” he says, “I priest spite myself, call Bishop now. Take episcopal blessing,” he hands paper. ‘“He stole money me,” says Boney shoulder. “A Bank France another things must make.

This gentleman found street fed I hungry.” ‘“I see; he made fine scene it, paid him, I suppose. Meantime, France waits.” ‘“Oh! poor France!” says Talleyrand. “Good-bye, Candide,” he says me. “By way,” he says, “have yet got Red Jacket’s permission tell President said his Cabinet Monsieur Genet rode away?” ‘I could not speak, I could shake head, Boney--so impatient he go his doings--he ran fair pushed room. And it.’ Pharaoh stood slid his fiddle one his big skirt-pockets though dead hare. ‘Oh! want know lots lots more,’ said Dan. ‘How got home--and old Maingon said barge--and was not cousin surprised he give back BERTHE AURETTE, and--’ ‘Tell us Toby!’ cried Una. ‘Yes, Red Jacket,’ said Dan. ‘Will not tell us more?’ pleaded. Puck kicked oak branch fire, till sent column smoke made sneeze. When finished Shaw empty except old Hobden stamping larches. ‘They gipsies took two,’ he said. ‘My black pullet liddle gingy-speckled cockrel.’ ‘I thought so,’ said Dan, picking one tail-feather old woman overlooked. ‘Which way go? Which way runagates go?’ said Hobden. ‘Hobby!’ said Una. ‘Would like told Keeper Ridley goings comings?’ ‘Poor Honest Men’ Your jar Virginny Will cost guinea, Which reckon much five shilling ten; But light churchwarden And judge accordin’ When I have told troubles poor honest men.

THE CONVERSION OF ST WILFRID Eddi’s Service Eddi, priest St Wilfrid In chapel Manhood End, Ordered midnight service For cared attend. But Saxons keeping Christmas, And night stormy well. Nobody came service Though Eddi rang bell. ‘Wicked weather walking,’ Said Eddi Manhood End. ‘But I must go service For care attend.’ The altar candles lighted,-- An old marsh donkey came, Bold guest invited, And stared guttering flame. The storm beat windows, The water splashed floor, And wet yoke-weary bullock Pushed open door. ‘How I know greatest, How I know least? That My Father’s business,’ Said Eddi, Wilfrid’s priest. ‘But, three gathered together-- Listen attend. I bring good news, brethren!’ Said Eddi, Manhood End. And he told Ox manger And stall Bethlehem, And he spoke Ass Rider That rode jerusalem. They steamed dripped chancel, They listened never stirred, While, though Bishops, Eddi preached The Word. Till gale blew marshes And windows showed day, And Ox Ass together Wheeled clattered away. And Saxons mocked him, Said Eddi Manhood End, ‘I dare shut His chapel On care attend.’ The Conversion St Wilfrid They bought peppermints village, coming home past little St Barnabas’ Church, saw Jimmy Kidbrooke, carpenter’s baby, kicking churchyard gate, shaving his mouth tears running his cheeks. Una pulled shaving put peppermint. Jimmy said he looking his grand-daddy--he never seemed take much notice his father--so went old graves, leaf-dropping limes, porch, Jim trotted in, looked empty Church, screamed like gate-hinge. Young Sam Kidbrooke’s voice came bell-tower made jump. ‘Why, jimmy,’ he called, ‘what here? Fetch him, Father!’ Old Mr Kidbrooke stumped downstairs, jerked Jimmy his shoulder, stared children beneath his brass spectacles, stumped back again. They laughed: exactly like Mr Kidbrooke. ‘It is right,’ Una called stairs. ‘We found him, Sam. Does his mother know?’ ‘He is come himself. She will justabout crazy,’ Sam answered. ‘Then I will run street tell her.’ Una darted off. ‘Thank you, Miss Una. Would like see we are mendin’ bell-beams, Mus’ Dan?’ Dan hopped up, saw young Sam lying his stomach delightful place among beams ropes, close five great bells. Old Mr Kidbrooke floor beneath planing piece wood, Jimmy eating shavings fast came away. He never looked Jimmy; Jimmy never stopped eating; broad gilt-bobbed pendulum church clock never stopped swinging across white-washed wall tower. Dan winked sawdust fell his upturned face. ‘Ring bell,’ he called. ‘I must not that, I will buzz one ‘them bit you,’ said Sam. He pounded sound-bow biggest bell, waked hollow groaning boom ran tower like creepy feelings back. Just almost began hurt, died away hurry beautiful sorrowful cries, like wine-glass rubbed wet finger. The pendulum clanked--one loud clank silent swing. Dan heard Una return Mrs Kidbrooke’s, ran fetch her. She standing font staring one kneeled Altar-rail. ‘Is Lady practises organ?’ she whispered. ‘No. She is gone organ-place. Besides, she wears black,’ Dan replied. The figure rose came nave. It white-haired man long white gown sort scarf looped low neck, one end hanging his shoulder. His loose long sleeves embroidered gold, deep strip gold embroidery waved sparkled round hem his gown. ‘Go meet him,’ said Puck’s voice behind font. ‘It is Wilfrid.’ ‘Wilfrid who?’ said Dan. ‘You come along too.’ ‘Wilfrid--Saint Sussex, Archbishop York. I shall wait till he asks me.’ He waved forward. Their feet squeaked old grave-slabs centre aisle. The Archbishop raised one hand pink ring it, said something Latin. He handsome, his thin face looked almost silvery his thin circle hair. ‘Are alone?’ he asked. ‘Puck’s here, course,’ said Una. ‘Do know him?’ ‘I know better I used to.’ He beckoned Dan’s shoulder, spoke Latin. Puck pattered forward, holding straight arrow. The Archbishop smiled. ‘Be welcome,’ said he. ‘Be welcome.’ ‘Welcome also, O Prince church,’ Puck replied. The Archbishop bowed his head passed on, till he glimmered like white moth shadow font. ‘He look awfully princely,’ said Una. ‘Is not he coming back?’ ‘Oh yes. He is looking church. He is fond churches,’ said Puck. ‘What is that?’ The Lady practices organ speaking blower-boy behind organ-screen. ‘We cannot well talk here,’ Puck whispered. ‘Let us go Panama Corner.’ He led end south aisle, slab iron says queer, long-tailed letters: ORATE P. ANNEMA JHONE COLINE. The children always called Panama Corner. The Archbishop moved slowly little church, peering old memorial tablets new glass windows. The Lady practises organ began pull stops rustle hymn-books behind screen. ‘I hope she will soft lacey tunes--like treacle porridge,’ said Una. ‘I like trumpety ones best,’ said Dan. ‘Oh, look Wilfrid! He is trying shut Altar-gates!’ ‘Tell he must not,’ said Puck, quite seriously. He cannot, anyhow,’ Dan muttered, tiptoed Panama Corner Archbishop patted patted carved gates always sprang open beneath his hand. ‘That is use, sir,’ Dan whispered. ‘Old Mr Kidbrooke says Altar-gates one pair gates man shut. He made ‘them himself.’ The Archbishop’s blue eyes twinkled. Dan saw he knew it. ‘I beg pardon,’ Dan stammered--very angry Puck. ‘Yes, I know! He made Himself.’ The Archbishop smiled, crossed Panama Corner, Una dragged certain padded arm-chair sit on. The organ played softly. ‘What music say?’ he asked. Una dropped chant without thinking: ‘“O ye works Lord, bless ye Lord; praise magnify ever.” We call Noah’s Ark, it is lists things--beasts birds whales, know.’ ‘Whales?’ said Archbishop quickly. ‘Yes--“O ye whales, move waters,”’ Una hummed--‘“Bless ye Lord.” It sounds like wave turning over, does not it?’ ‘Holy Father,’ said Puck demure face, ‘is little seal also “one moves water”?’ ‘Eh? Oh yes--yess!’ he laughed. ‘A seal moves wonderfully waters. Do seal come island still?’ Puck shook his head. ‘All little islands swept away.’ ‘Very possible. The tides ran fiercely there. Do know land Sea-calf, maiden?’ ‘No--but we have seen seals--at Brighton.’ ‘The Archbishop thinking little farther coast. He means Seal’s Eye--Selsey--down Chichester way--where he converted South Saxons,’ Puck explained. ‘Yes--yess; South Saxons convert me,’ said Archbishop, smiling. ‘The first time I wrecked coast. As ship took ground tried push her off, old fat fellow seal, I remember, reared breast-high water, scratched his head his flipper he saying: “What excited person pole think he doing.” I wet miserable, I could help laughing, till natives came attacked us.’ ‘What do?’ Dan asked. ‘One could not well go back France, one tried make go back shore. All South Saxons born wreckers, like Northumbrian folk. I bringing things old church York, natives laid hands them, and--and I am afraid I lost temper.’ ‘It said--’ Puck’s voice wickedly meek--‘that great fight.’ Eh, I must ha’ silly lad.’ Wilfrid spoke sudden thick burr his voice. He coughed, took his silvery tones again. ‘There fight really. My men thumped them, tide rose half hour time, strong wind, backed off. What I wanted say, though, was, seas us full sleek seals watching scuffle. My good Eddi--my chaplain--insisted demons. Yes--yess! That first acquaintance South Saxons seals.’ ‘But time wrecked, it?’ said Dan. ‘Alas, no! On sea land life seems one long shipwreck.’ He looked Jhone Coline slab old Hobden sometimes looks fire. ‘Ah, well!’ ‘But ever adventures among seals?’ said Una, little. ‘Oh, seals! I beg pardon. They important things. Yes--yess! I went back South Saxons twelve--fifteen--years. No, I come water, overland Northumbria, see I could do. It is little one class native except make stop killing themselves--’ ‘Why kill themselves?’ Una asked, her chin her hand. ‘Because heathen. When grew tired life (as people!) would jump sea. They called going Wotan. It was not want food always--by means. A man would tell he felt grey heart, woman would say she saw nothing long days front her; they would saunter away mud-flats and--that would end them, poor souls, unless one headed off. One run quick, one cannot allow people lay hands happen feel grey. Yes--yess--Extraordinary people, South Saxons. Disheartening, sometimes.... What say now?’ The organ changed tune again. ‘Only hymn next Sunday,’ said Una. ‘“The Church’s One Foundation.” Go on, please, running mud. I like seen you.’ ‘I dare say would, I really could run days. Ethelwalch King gave five six muddy parishes sea, first time good Eddi I rode saw man slouching along slob, among seals Manhood End. My good Eddi disliked seals--but he swallowed his objections ran like hare.’ ‘Why?’ said Dan. ‘For reason I did. We thought one people going drown himself. As matter fact, Eddi I nearly drowned pools overtook him. To cut long story short, found muddy, breathless, quietly made fun good Latin well-spoken person. No--he would idea going Wotan. He fishing his beaches, he showed us beacons turf-heaps divided his land church property. He took us his house, gave us good dinner, good wine, sent guide us Chichester, became one best refreshing friends. He Meon descent, west edge kingdom; scholar educated, curiously enough, Lyons, old school; travelled world over, even Rome, brilliant talker. We found scores acquaintances common. It seemed he small chief King Ethelwalch, I fancy King somewhat afraid him. The South Saxons mistrust man talks well. Ah! Now, I have left point story. He kept great grey-muzzled old dog-seal he brought pup. He called Padda--after one clergy. It rather like fat, honest old Padda. The creature followed everywhere, nearly knocked good Eddi first met him. Eddi loathed it. It used sniff his thin legs cough him. I cannot say I ever took much notice (I fond animals), till one day Eddi came circumstantial account witchcraft Meon worked. He would tell seal go beach last thing night, bring word weather. When came back, Meon might say his slaves, “Padda thinks shall wind tomorrow. Haul boats!” I spoke Meon casually story, he laughed. ‘He told he could judge look creature’s coat way sniffed weather brewing. Quite possible. One need put everything one understand work bad spirits--or good ones, matter.’ He nodded towards Puck, nodded gaily return. ‘I say so,’ he went on, ‘because certain extent I made victim habit mind. Some I settled Selsey, King Ethelwalch Queen Ebba ordered people baptized. I fear I am old believe whole nation change heart King’s command, I shrewd suspicion real motive get good harvest. No rain fallen two three years, soon finished baptizing, fell heavily, said miracle.’ ‘And it?’ Dan asked. ‘Everything life miracle, but’--the Archbishop twisted heavy ring his finger--‘I slow--ve-ry slow I be--to assume certain sort miracle happens whenever lazy improvident people say going turn new leaf paid it. My friend Meon sent his slaves font, he come himself, next time I rode over--to return manuscript--I took liberty asking why. He perfectly open it. He looked King’s action heathen attempt curry favour Christians’ God Archbishop, he would none it. ‘“My dear man,” I said, “admitting case, surely you, educated person, do not believe Wotan hobgoblins Padda here?” The old seal hunched his ox-hide behind his master’s chair. ‘“Even I do not,” he said, “why I insult memory fathers’ Gods? I sent hundred three rascals christen. Is not enough?” ‘“By means,” I answered. “I want you.” ‘“He wants us! What think that, Padda?” He pulled seal’s whiskers till threw back head roared, he pretended interpret. “No! Padda says he will not baptized yet awhile. He says you will stay dinner come fishing tomorrow, you are over-worked need rest.” ‘“I wish you would keep yon brute proper place,” I said, Eddi, chaplain, agreed. ‘“I do,” said Meon. “I keep next heart. He cannot tell lie, he does not know love one except me. It ‘ud I dying mud-bank, would not it, Padda?” ‘“Augh! Augh!” said Padda, put his head scratched. ‘Then Meon began tease Eddi: “Padda says, Eddi saw his Archbishop dying mud-bank Eddi would tuck his gown run. Padda knows Eddi run too! Padda came Wittering Church last Sunday--all wet--to hear music, Eddi ran out.” ‘My good Eddi rubbed his hands his shins together, flushed. “Padda child Devil, father lies!” he cried, begged pardon spoken. I forgave him. ‘“Yes. You stupid enough musician,” said Meon. “But he is. Sing hymn him, see he stand it. You will find small harp beside fireplace.” ‘Eddi, really excellent musician, played sang quite half hour. Padda shuffled his ox-hide, hunched his flippers him, listened his head thrown back. Yes--yess! A rather funny sight! Meon tried laugh, asked Eddi he satisfied. ‘It takes time get idea good Eddi’s head. He looked me. ‘“Do want sprinkle holy water, see he flies chimney? Why baptize him?” said Meon. ‘Eddi really shocked. I thought bad taste myself. ‘“That is fair,” said Meon. “You call demon familiar spirit he loves his master likes music, I offer chance prove will not take it. Look here! I will make bargain. I will baptized you will baptize Padda too. He is man slaves.” ‘“One does not bargain--or joke--about matters,” I said. He going altogether far. ‘“Quite right,” said Meon; “I should not like one joke Padda. Padda, go beach bring us tomorrow’s weather!” ‘My good Eddi must little over-tired his day’s work. “I servant church,” he cried. “My business save souls, enter fellowships understandings accursed beasts.” ‘“Have narrow way,” said Meon. “Padda, need not go.” The old fellow flounced back his ox-hide once. ‘“Man could learn obedience least creature,” said Eddi, little ashamed himself. Christians curse. ‘“Do not begin apologise Just I beginning like you,” said Meon. “We will leave Padda behind tomorrow--out respect feelings. Now let us go supper. We must early tomorrow whiting.” ‘The next beautiful crisp autumn morning--a weather-breeder, I taken trouble think; it is refreshing escape kings converts half day. We three went Meon’s smallest boat, got whiting near old wreck, mile shore. Meon knew marks yard, fish keen. Yes--yess! A perfect morning’s fishing! If Bishop cannot fisherman, can?’ He twiddled his ring again. ‘We stayed little long, getting stone, came fog. After discussion, decided row land. The ebb beginning make round point, sent us ways like coracle.’ ‘Selsey Bill,’ said Puck his breath. ‘The tides run something furious there.’ ‘I believe you,’ said Archbishop. ‘Meon I spent good many evenings arguing exactly drifted. All I know found little rocky cove sprung round us fog, swell lifted boat ledge, she broke beneath feet. We time shuffle weed next wave. The sea rising. ‘“It is rather pity did not let Padda go beach last night,” said Meon. “He might warned us coming.” ‘“Better fall hands God hands demons,” said Eddi, his teeth chattered he prayed. A nor’-west breeze got up--distinctly cool. ‘“Save boat,” said Meon; “we may need it,” drench again, fishing stray planks.’ ‘What for?’ said Dan. ‘For firewood. We know get off. Eddi flint steel, found dry fuel old gulls’ nests lit fire. It smoked abominably, guarded boat-planks up-ended rocks. One gets used sort thing one travels. Unluckily I am strong I was. I fear I must trouble friends. It blowing full gale midnight. Eddi wrung his cloak, tried wrap it, I ordered his obedience keep it. However, he held his arms first night, Meon begged his pardon he would said night before--about Eddi, running away he found sandbank, remember. ‘“You right half prophecy,” said Eddi. “I tucked gown, rate.” (The wind blown his head.) “Now let us thank God His mercies.” ‘“Hum!” said Meon. “If gale lasts, stand fair chance dying starvation.” ‘“If God’s survive, God provide,” said Eddi. “At least help sing Him.” The wind almost whipped words his mouth, he braced rock sang psalms. ‘I am glad I never concealed opinion--from myself--that Eddi better man I. Yet I worked hard time--very hard! Yes--yess! So morning evening second day islet. There rain-water rock-pools, and, churchman, I knew fast, I admit hungry. Meon fed fire chip chip eke out, made sit it, dear fellows, I weak object. Meon held his arms second night, like child. My good Eddi little his senses, imagined teaching York choir sing. Even so, he beautifully patient them. ‘I heard Meon whisper, “If keeps shall go Gods. I wonder Wotan say me. He must know I do not believe him. On hand, I cannot Ethelwalch finds easy--curry favour God last minute, hope saved--as call it. How advise, Bishop?” ‘“My dear man,” I said, “if honest belief, I take upon say far better curry favour God. But it is Jutish pride holds back, lift up, I will baptize even now.” ‘“Lie still,” said Meon. “I could judge better I hall. But desert one’s fathers’ Gods--even one does not believe them--in middle gale, is not quite--What would yourself?” ‘I lying his arms, kept alive warmth his big, steady heart. It seem time place subtle arguments, I answered, “No, I certainly desert God.” I do not see even else I could said. ‘“Thank you. I will remember that, I live,” said Meon, I must drifted back dreams Northumbria beautiful France, broad daylight I heard calling Wotan high, shaking heathen yell I detest so. ‘“Lie quiet. I am giving Wotan his chance,” he said. Our dear Eddi ambled up, still beating time his imaginary choir. ‘“Yes. Call Gods,” he cried, “and see gifts send you. They gone journey, hunting.” ‘I assure words his mouth old Padda shot top cold wrinkled swell, drove weedy ledge, landed fair laps rock-cod his teeth. I could help smiling Eddi’s face. “A miracle! A miracle!” he cried, kneeled clean cod. ‘“You have long time finding us, son,” said Meon. “Now fish--fish lives. We are starving, Padda.” ‘The old fellow flung quivering like salmon backward boil currents round rocks, Meon said, “We are safe. I will send fetch help wind drops. Eat thankful.” ‘I never tasted anything good rock-codlings took Padda’s mouth half roasted fire. Between his plunges Padda would hunch purr Meon tears running his face. I never knew seals could weep joy--as I wept. ‘“Surely,” said Eddi, his mouth full, “God made seal loveliest His creatures water. Look Padda breasts current! He stands like rock; watch chain bubbles he dives; now--there his wise head rock-ledge! Oh, blessing thee, little brother Padda!” ‘“You said he child Devil!” Meon laughed. ‘“There I sinned,” poor Eddi answered. “Call here, I ask his pardon. God sent storm humble me, fool.” ‘“I will not ask enter fellowships understandings accursed brute,” said Meon, rather unkindly. “Shall say he sent Bishop ravens sent prophet Elijah?” ‘“Doubtless so,” said Eddi. “I write I live get home.” ‘“No--no!” I said. “Let us three poor men kneel thank God His mercies.” ‘We kneeled, old Padda shuffled thrust his head Meon’s elbows. I laid hand upon blessed him. So Eddi. ‘“And now, son,” I said Meon, “shall I baptize thee?” ‘“Not yet,” said he. “Wait till well ashore home. No God Heaven shall say I came left I wet cold. I send Padda people boat. Is witchcraft, Eddi?” ‘“Why, no. Surely Padda go pull beach skirts gowns he pulled Wittering Church ask sing. Only I afraid, understand,” said Eddi. ‘“You understanding now,” said Meon, wave his arm went Padda mainland, making wake like war-boat till lost rain. Meon’s people could bring boat across hours; even ticklish work among rocks tideway. But hoisted aboard, stiff move, Padda swam behind us, barking turning somersaults way Manhood End!’ ‘Good old Padda!’ murmured Dan. ‘When quite rested re-clothed, his people summoned--not hour before--Meon offered baptized.’ ‘Was Padda baptized too?’ Una asked. ‘No, Meon’s joke. But he sat blinking his ox-hide middle hall. When Eddi (who thought I was not looking) made little cross holy water his wet muzzle, he kissed Eddi’s hand. A week Eddi would not touched him. That miracle, like! But seriously, I glad I tell get Meon. A rare splendid soul never looked back--never looked back!’ The Arch-bishop half closed his eyes. ‘But, sir,’ said Puck, respectfully, ‘have not left Meon said afterwards?’ Before Bishop could speak he turned children went on: ‘Meon called his fishers ploughmen herdsmen hall he said: “Listen, men! Two days ago I asked Bishop whether fair man desert his fathers’ Gods time danger. Our Bishop said fair. You need not shout like that, Christians now. My red war-boat’s crew remember near death Padda fetched Bishop’s islet. You tell mates even place, time, hanging wet, weedy edge death, Bishop, Christian, counselled me, heathen, stand fathers’ Gods. I tell faith takes care every man shall keep faith, even though he may save his soul breaking faith, faith man believe in. So I believe Christian God, Wilfrid His Bishop, Church Wilfrid rules. You baptized King’s orders. I shall baptized again; I find old women sent Wotan, girls dancing sly Balder, men talking Thun Lok rest, I teach hands keep faith Christian God. Go quietly; you will find couple beefs beach.” Then course shouted “Hurrah!” meant “Thor help us!” and--I think laughed, sir?’ ‘I think remember well,’ said Archbishop, smiling. ‘It joyful day me. I learned great deal rock Padda found us. Yes--yess! One deal kindly creatures God, gently masters. But one learns late.’ He rose, his gold-embroidered sleeves rustled thickly. The organ cracked took deep breaths. ‘Wait minute,’ Dan whispered. ‘She is going trumpety one. It takes wind pump. It is Latin, sir.’ ‘There tongue,’ Archbishop answered. ‘It is real hymn,’ Una explained. ‘She treat her exercises. She is not real organist, know. She comes sometimes, Albert Hall.’ ‘Oh, miracle voice!’ said Archbishop. It rang suddenly dark arch lonely noises--every word spoken end: ‘Dies Irae, dies illa, Solvet saeclum favilla, Teste David cum Sibylla.’ The Archbishop caught his breath moved forward. The music carried while. ‘Now it is calling light windows,’ Una whispered Dan. ‘I think it is like horse neighing battle,’ he whispered back. The voice continued: ‘Tuba mirum spargens sonum Per sepulchre regionum.’ Deeper deeper organ dived down, far deepest note heard Puck’s voice joining last line: ‘Coget omnes ante thronum.’ As looked wonder, sounded like dull jar one pillars shifting, little fellow turned went south door. ‘Now’s sorrowful part, it is beautiful.’ Una found herself speaking empty chair front her. ‘What for?’ Dan said behind her. ‘You spoke politely too.’ ‘I do not know... I thought--’ said Una. ‘Funny!’ ‘’Tisn’t. It is part like best,’ Dan grunted. The music turned soft--full little sounds chased wings across broad gentle flood main tune. But voice ten times lovelier music. ‘Recordare Jesu pie, Quod sum causa Tuae viae, Ne perdas illi die!’ There more. They moved centre aisle. ‘That you?’ Lady called she shut lid. ‘I thought I heard you, I played purpose.’ ‘Thank awfully,’ said Dan. ‘We hoped would, waited.

He saw her lamp come garden disappear she hid her cloak. While he listened her footsteps, somebody (they thought Phillips gardener) coughed corner herb-beds. ‘All right,’ Una shouted across asparagus; ‘we are not hurting old beds, Phippsey!’ She flashed her lantern towards spot, circle light saw Guy Fawkes-looking man black cloak steeple-crowned hat, walking path beside Puck. They ran meet him, man said something rooms head. After time understood he warning catch colds. ‘You have bit cold yourself, have not you?’ said Una, he ended his sentences consequential cough. Puck laughed. ‘Child,’ man answered, ‘if hath pleased Heaven afflict infirmity--’ ‘Nay, nay,’ Puck struck In, ‘the maid spoke kindness. I know half cough catch trick vulgar; that is pity. There is honesty enough you, Nick, without rasping hawking.’ ‘Good people’--the man shrugged his lean shoulders--‘the vulgar crowd love truth unadorned. Wherefore philosophers must needs dress her catch eye or--ahem!---their ear.’ ‘And d’you think that?’ said Puck solemnly Dan. ‘I do not know,’ he answered. ‘It sounds like lessons.’ ‘Ah--well! There worse men Nick Culpeper take lessons from. Now, sit that is indoors?’ ‘In hay-mow, next old Middenboro,’ Dan suggested. ‘He does not mind.’ ‘Eh?’ Mr Culpeper stooping pale hellebore blooms light Una’s lamp. ‘Does Master Middenboro need poor services, then?’ ‘Save him, no!’ said Puck. ‘He horse--next door ass, you will see presently. Come!’ Their shadows jumped slid fruit-tree walls. They filed garden snoring pig-pound crooning hen-house, she would Middenboro old lawn-mower pony lives. His friendly eyes showed green light set lamps chickens’ drinking-trough outside, pushed past hay-mow.

A bicycle knew well walked steep lane. ‘Where?’ Mr Culpeper leaned forward quickly. ‘That? Some countryman’s lantern.’ ‘Wrong, Nick,’ said Puck. ‘It Is singular bright star Virgo, declining towards house Aquarius water-carrier, hath lately afflicted Gemini. Are not I right, Una?’ Mr Culpeper snorted contemptuously. ‘No. It is village nurse going Mill fresh twins came last week. Nurse,’ Una called, light stopped flat, ‘when I see Morris twins? And they?’ ‘Next Sunday, perhaps. Doing beautifully,’ Nurse called back, ping-ping-ping bell brushed round corner. ‘Her uncle’s vetinary surgeon near Banbury,’ Una explained, ring her bell night, rings right beside her bed--not downstairs all. Then she ‘umps up--she always keeps pair dry boots fender, know--and goes anywhere she is wanted. We help her bicycle gaps sometimes. Most her babies beautifully. She told us herself.’ ‘I doubt not, then, she reads books,’ said Mr Culpeper quietly. ‘Twins Mill!’ he muttered half aloud. “And He sayeth, Return, ye children men.”’ ‘Are doctor rector?’ Una asked, Puck shout turned head heels hay. But Mr Culpeper quite serious. He told he physician-astrologer--a doctor knew stars well herbs medicine. He said sun, moon, five Planets, called Jupiter, Mars, Mercury, Saturn, Venus, governed everybody everything world. They lived Houses--he mapped dark busy forefinger--and moved House House like pieces draughts; went loving hating skies. If knew likes dislikes, he said, could make cure patient hurt enemy, find secret causes things. He talked five Planets though belonged him, though he playing long games them. The children burrowed hay chins, looked half-door solemn, star-powdered sky till seemed falling upside it, Mr Culpeper talked ‘trines’ ‘oppositions’ ‘conjunctions’ ‘sympathies’ ‘antipathies’ tone matched things. A rat ran Middenboro’s feet, old pony stamped. ‘Mid hates rats,’ said Dan, passed lock hay. ‘I wonder why.’ ‘Divine Astrology tells us,’ said Mr Culpeper. ‘The horse, martial beast beareth man battle, belongs naturally red planet Mars--the Lord War. I would show him, he is near his setting. Rats mice, businesses night, come dominion Lady Moon. Now Mars Luna, one red, t’other white, one hot t’other cold forth, stands, I told you, natural antipathy, or, say, hatred. Which antipathy creatures inherit. Whence, good people, may see hear cattle stamp stalls self-same causes decree passages stars across unalterable face Heaven! Ahem!’ Puck lay along chewing leaf. They felt shake laughter, Mr Culpeper sat stiffly. ‘I myself’ said he, ‘have saved men’s lives, neither, observing proper time--there time, mark you, things sun--by observing, I say, small beast rat conjunction great matter dread arch us.’ He swept his hand across sky. ‘Yet those,’ he went sourly, ‘who years without knowledge.’ ‘Right,’ said Puck. ‘No fool like old fool.’ Mr Culpeper wrapped his cloak round sat still children stared Great Bear hilltop. ‘Give time,’ Puck whispered behind his hand. ‘He turns like timber-tug--all piece.’ ‘Ahem!’ Mr Culpeper said suddenly. ‘I will prove you. When I physician Saye’s Horse, fought King--or rather man Charles Stuart--in Oxfordshire (I learning Cambridge), plague hot around us. I saw close hands. He says I ignorant plague, example, altogether beside bridge.’ ‘We grant it,’ said Puck solemnly. ‘But talk plague rare night?’ ‘To prove argument. This Oxfordshire plague, good people, generated among rivers ditches, werish, watery nature. Therefore curable drenching patient cold water, laying wet cloths; least, I cured them. Mark this. It bears shall come after.’ ‘Mark also, Nick,’ said Puck, College Physicians, lad lass poor lubberkin. Therefore plain, old Hyssop Wall!’ ‘To plain order you, I shot chest gathering betony brookside near Thame, took King’s men Colonel, one Blagg Bragge, I warned honestly I spent week past among plague-stricken. He flung cowshed, much like here, die, I supposed; one priests crept night dressed wound. He Sussex man like myself.’ ‘Who that?’ said Puck suddenly. ‘Zack Tutshom?’ ‘No, Jack Marget,’ said Mr Culpeper. ‘Jack Marget New College? The little merry man stammered so? Why plague stuttering Jack Oxford then?’ said Puck. ‘He come Sussex hope made Bishop King conquered rebels, he styled us Parliament men. His College lent King monies too, never got again, simple Jack got his bishopric. When met he bitter bellyful King’s promises, wished return his wife babes. This came beyond expectation, for, soon I could stand wound, man Blagge made excuse I among plague, Jack tending me, thrust us camp. The King done Jack Jack’s College lent money, Blagge’s physician could abide I would sit silent see butcher sick. (He College Physicians man!) So Blagge, I say, thrust us out, many vile words, pair pestilent, prating, pragmatical rascals.’ ‘Ha! Called pragmatical, Nick?’ Puck started up. ‘High time Oliver came purge land! How honest Jack fare next?’ ‘We sort constrained other’s company. I going house Spitalfields, he would go his parish Sussex; plague broke spreading Wiltshire, Berkshire, Hampshire, he mad distracted think might even among his folk home I bore company. He comforted distress. I could done less; I remembered I cousin Great Wigsell, near Jack’s parish. Thus footed Oxford, cassock buff coat together, resolute leave wars left side henceforth; either mean appearances, plague making men less cruel, hindered. To sure, put us stocks one half-day rogues vagabonds village St Leonard’s forest, where, I heard, nightingales never sing; constable honestly gave back Astrological Almanac, I carry me.’ Mr Culpeper tapped his thin chest. ‘I dressed whitlow his thumb. So went forward. ‘Not trouble impertinences, fetched Jack Marget’s parish storm rain day’s end. Here roads divided, I would gone cousin Great Wigsell, Jack pointing his steeple, saw man lying drunk, he conceived, athwart road. He said would one Hebden, parishioner, till man good life; he accused bitterly unfaithful shepherd, left his flock follow princes. But I saw plague, beginnings neither. They set plague-stone, man’s head lay it.’ ‘What is plague-stone?’ Dan whispered. ‘When plague hot village neighbours shut roads ‘them, people set hollowed stone, pot, pan, would purchase victual outside may lay money paper wants, depart. Those would sell come later--what man gain?---snatch money forth, leave exchange goods conscience reckons fair value. I saw silver groat water, man’s list he would buy rain-pulped his wet hand. ‘“My wife! Oh, wife babes!” says Jack sudden, makes uphill--I him. ‘A woman peers behind barn, crying village stricken plague, lives’ sake must avoid it. ‘“Sweetheart!” says Jack. “Must I avoid thee?” she leaps says babes safe. She his wife. ‘When he thanked God, even tears, he tells welcome he intended, presses flee place I clean. ‘“Nay! The Lord also I desert thee now,” I said. “These affairs are, God’s leave, fashion strength.” ‘“Oh, sir,” she says, “are physician? We none.” ‘“Then, good people,” said I, “I must e’en justify works.” ‘“Look--look ye,” stammers Jack, “I took time crazy Roundhead preacher.” He laughs, she, I--all three together rain overtook unreasonable gust clap laughter, none less eased us. We call medicine Hysterical Passion. So I went home ‘them.’ ‘Why go cousin Great Wigsell, Nick?’ Puck suggested. ‘it is barely seven mile road.’ ‘But plague here,’ Mr Culpeper answered, pointed hill. ‘What else could I done?’ ‘What parson’s children called?’ said Una. ‘Elizabeth, Alison, Stephen, Charles--a babe. I scarce saw first, I separated live father cart-lodge. The mother put--forced--into house her babes. She done enough. ‘And now, good people, give leave particular case. The plague worst north side street, lack, I showed ‘them, sunshine; which, proceeding PRIME MOBILE, source life (I speak astrologically), cleansing purifying highest degree. The plague hot corn-chandler’s, sell forage carters, extreme hot Mills, along river, scatteringly places, except, mark you, smithy. Mark here, forges smith shops belong Mars, even corn meat wine shops acknowledge Venus mistress. There plague smithy Munday’s Lane--’ ‘Munday’s Lane? You mean village? I thought talked two Mills,’ cried Dan. ‘Where put plague-stone? I would like seen it.’ ‘Then look now,’ said Puck, pointed chickens’ drinking-trough set bicycle lamps. It rough, oblong stone pan, rather like small kitchen sink, Phillips, never wastes anything, found ditch used his precious hens. ‘That?’ said Dan Una, stared, stared, stared. Mr Culpeper made impatient noises his throat went on. ‘I pains particular, good people, I would follow, far may, operations mind. That plague I told I handled outside Wallingford Oxfordshire watery nature, conformable brookish riverine country bred in, curable, I said, drenching water. This plague here, flourished along watercourses--every soul Mills died it,--could handled. Which brought stand. Ahem!’ ‘And sick people meantime?’ Puck demanded. ‘We persuaded north side street lie Hitheram’s field. Where plague taken one, two, house, folk would shift fear thieves absence. They cast away lives die among goods.’ ‘Human nature,’ said Puck. ‘I have seen time again. How sick fields?’ ‘They died near thick kept within doors, even died distraction melancholy plague. But I confess, good people, I could sort master sickness, come glimmer nature governance. To brief, I flat bewildered brute malignity disease, so--did I done before--dismissed conjectures apprehensions grown within me, chose good hour Almanac, clapped vinegar-cloth face, entered empty houses, resigned wait upon stars guidance.’ ‘At night? Were horribly frightened?’ said Puck. ‘I dared hope God hath made man nobly curious search His mysteries might destroy devout seeker. In due time--there is time, I said, everything sun--I spied whitish rat, puffed scabby, sat beneath dormer attic shined Lady Moon. Whilst I looked him--and her--she moving towards old cold Saturn, her ancient ally--the rat creeped languishingly her light, there, eyes, died. Presently his mate companion came out, laid beside there, like fashion died too. Later--an hour less midnight--a third rat e’en same; always choosing moonlight die in. This threw amaze, since, know, moonlight favourable, hurtful, creatures Moon; Saturn, friends her, would say, hourly strengthening her evil influence. Yet three rats stricken dead moonlight. I leaned window see Heaven’s host might side, beheld I good trusty Mars, red heated, bustling his setting. I straddled roof see better. ‘Jack Marget came street going comfort sick Hitheram’s field. A tile slipped foot. Says he, heavily enough, “Watchman, night?” ‘“Heart up, Jack,” says I. “Methinks there is one fighting us that, like fool, I have forgot summer.” My meaning naturally planet Mars. ‘“Pray Him then,” says he. “I forgot Him summer.” ‘He meant God, he always bitterly accused forgotten Oxfordshire, among King’s men. I called he made amends enough his sin his work among sick, he said he would believe till plague lifted ‘them. He his strength’s end--more melancholy because. I seen among priests overcheerful men. I drenched half-cup waters, I say cure plague, excellent heaviness spirits.’ ‘What they?’ said Dan. ‘White brandy rectified, camphor, cardamoms, ginger, two sorts pepper, aniseed.’ ‘Whew!’ said Puck. ‘Waters call ‘them!’ ‘Jack coughed valiantly, went downhill me. I Lower Mill valley, note aspect Heavens. My mind already shadowed forth reason, remedy, troubles, I would impart vulgar till I satisfied. That practice may perfect, judgment ought sound, make judgment sound required exquisite knowledge. Ahem! I left Jack his lantern among sick Hitheram’s field. He still maintained prayers so-called Church, rightly forbidden Cromwell.’ ‘You told cousin Wigsell,’ said Puck, ‘and Jack would fined it, you would half money. How come fail duty, Nick?’ Mr Culpeper laughed--his laugh evening--and children jumped loud neigh it. ‘We fearful men’s judgment days,’ he answered. ‘Now mark closely, good people, follows you, though me, remarkable. When I reached empty Mill, old Saturn, low House Fishes, threatened Sun’s rising-place. Our Lady Moon moving towards help (understand, I speak astrologically). I looked abroad upon high Heavens, I prayed Maker ‘them guidance. Now Mars sparkingly withdrew sky. On instant his departure, I noted, bright star vapour leaped forth his head (as though he heaved his sword), broke fire. The cocks crowed midnight valley, I sat mill-wheel, chewing spearmint (though that is herb Venus), calling asses’ heads world! ‘It Was plain enough now!’ ‘What plain?’ said Una. ‘The true cure plague. Mars, good fellow, fought us uttermost. Faint though he Heavens, made overlook computations, he planets kept Heavens--which say, visible part night wellnigh throughout year. Therefore his fierce cleansing influence, warring Moon, stretched kill three rats nose, nose natural mistress, Moon. I known Mars lean half across Heaven deal Lady Moon shrewd blow his shield, I never seen his strength displayed effectual.’ ‘I do not understand bit. Do mean Mars killed rats he hated Moon?’ said Una. ‘That plain pikestaff Blagge’s men pushed forth,’ Mr Culpeper answered. ‘I will prove it. Why plague broken blacksmith’s shop Munday’s Lane? Because, I have shown you, forges smithies belong naturally Mars, and, his honour’s sake, Mars ‘ud keep ‘them clean creatures Moon. But like, think you, he would come rat-catch general lazy, ungrateful mankind? That working willing horse death. So, then, see meaning blazing star he set simply this: “Destroy burn creatures Of moon, root trouble. And thus, shown taste power, good people, adieu.”’ ‘Did Mars really say that?’ Una whispered. ‘Yes, twice much one ears hear. Briefly, he enlightened plague spread creatures Moon. The Moon, Lady ill-aspect, offender. My poor wits showed I, Nick Culpeper, people charge, God’s good providence aiding me, time lose neither. ‘I posted hill, broke Hitheram’s field amongst ‘them prayers. ‘“Eureka, good people!” I cried, cast dead mill-rat I would found. “Here is true enemy, revealed last stars.” ‘“Nay, I am praying,” says Jack.

They laughed round this, Jack Marget falls his knees, presumptuously petitions he may appointed die save rest his people. This enough thrust ‘them back melancholy. ‘“You unfaithful shepherd, jack,” I says. “Take bat” (which call stick Sussex) “and kill rat die sunrise. ‘Twill save people.” ‘“Aye, aye. Take bat kill rat,” he says ten times over, like child, moved ‘them ungovernable motions hysterical passion mentioned, laughed all, least warmed chill bloods hour--one of the clock little after--when fires life burn lowest. Truly time everything; physician must work it--ahem!--or miss his cure. To brief you, I persuaded ‘them, sick sound, whole generation rats throughout village. And there is reason things too, though wise physician need blab ‘them all. Imprimis, firstly, mere sport it, lasted ten days, drew ‘them markedly melancholy. I would defy sorrowful job lament scratch he is routing rats rick. Secundo, secondly, vehement act operation chase war opened skins generous transpiration--more vulgarly, sweated ‘them handsomely; drew black bile--the mother sickness. Thirdly, came burn bodies rats, I sprinkled sulphur faggots, whereby onlookers handsomely suffumigated. This I could compassed I made mere physician’s business; they would thought conjuration. Yet more, cleansed, limed, burned hundred foul poke-holes, sinks, slews, corners unvisited filth houses village, good fortune (mark Mars opposition Venus) burned corn-handler’s shop ground. Mars loves Venus. Will Noakes saddler dropped his lantern truss straw he rat-hunting there.’ ‘Had ye given Will gentle cordial yours, Nick, chance?’ said Puck. ‘A glass--or two glasses--not more. But I would say, fine, killed rats, I took ash, slag, charcoal smithy, burnt earth brickyard (I reason brickyard belongs Mars), rammed iron crowbars rat-runs buries, beneath house floors. The Creatures Moon hate Mars hath used his clean ends. For example--rats bite iron.’ ‘And poor stuttering Jack endure it?’ said Puck. ‘He sweated his melancholy his skin, catched loose cough, I cured electuaries, according art. It noteworthy, I speaking among equals, venom plague translated, turned into, evaporated, went away as, heavy hoarseness thickness head, throat, chest.

Simple, forsooth?’ said Mr Culpeper. ‘A simple soul, high courage tempered sound stubborn conceit, stronger stars courses. So I confess truly saved village, Nick.’ ‘I stubborn? I stiff-necked? I ascribed poor success, God’s good providence, Divine Astrology. Not glory! You talk dear weeping ass Jack Marget preached I went back work Red Lion House, Spitalfields.’ ‘Oh! Stammering Jack preached, he? They say he loses his stammer pulpit.’ ‘And his wits it. He delivered idolatrous discourse plague stayed. He took his text: “The wise man delivered city.” I could given better, as: “There time for--“’ ‘But made go church hear him?’ Puck interrupted. ‘Wail Attersole lawfully appointed preacher, dull dog he was!’ Mr Culpeper wriggled uneasily. ‘The vulgar,’ said he, ‘the old crones and--ahem!---the children, Alison others, dragged House Rimmon hand. I two minds inform Jack maintaining mummeries falsely-called Church, which, I will prove you, founded merely ancient fables--’ ‘Stick herbs planets,’ said Puck, laughing. ‘You told magistrates, Nick, Jack fined. Again, neglect plain duty?’ ‘Because--because I kneeling, praying, weeping rest ‘them Altar-rails. In medicine called Hysterical Passion. It may be--it may be.’ ‘That is may be,’ said Puck. They heard turn hay. ‘Why, hay half hedge-brishings,’ he said. ‘You do not expect horse thrive oak ash thorn leaves, you?’ Ping-ping-ping went bicycle bell round corner. Nurse coming back mill. ‘Is right?’ Una called. ‘All quite right,’ Nurse called back. ‘They are christened next Sunday.’ ‘What? What?’ They leaned forward across half-door. It could properly fastened, opened, tilted hay leaves sticking them. ‘Come on! We must get two twins’ names,’ said Una, charged uphill shouting hedge, till Nurse slowed told them. When returned, old Middenboro got his stall, spent lively ten minutes chasing starlight. ‘Our Fathers Old’ Excellent herbs fathers old-- Excellent herbs ease pain-- Alexanders Marigold, Eyebright, Orris, Elecampane, Basil, Rocket, Valerian, Rue, (Almost singing run) Vervain, Dittany, Call-me-to-you-- Cowslip, Melilot, Rose Sun.

Simple Simon Cattiwow came steep lane his five-horse timber-tug. He stopped wood-lump back gate take brakes. His real name Brabon, first time children met him, years years ago, he told he ‘carting wood,’ sounded exactly like ‘cattiwow’ never called anything else. ‘HI!’ Una shouted top wood-lump, watching lane. ‘What doing? Why were not told?’ ‘They have sent me,’ Cattiwow answered. ‘There is middlin’ big log stacked dirt Rabbit Shaw, and’--he flicked his whip back along line--‘so they have sent us all.’ Dan Una threw wood-lump almost black Sailor’s nose. Cattiwow never let ride big beam makes body timber-tug, hung behind teeth thuttered. The Wood road beyond brook climbs woods, see horses’ backs rising, one another, like moving stairs. Cattiwow strode ahead his sackcloth woodman’s petticoat, belted waist leather strap; he turned grinned, his red lips showed his sackcloth-coloured beard. His cap sackcloth too, flap behind, keep twigs bark his neck. He navigated tug among pools heather-water splashed faces, clumps young birches slashed legs, hit old toadstooled stump, never knew whether would give way showers rotten wood, jar back again. At top Rabbit Shaw half-a-dozen men team horses stood round forty-foot oak log muddy hollow. The ground poached stoached sliding hoofmarks, wave dirt driven front butt. ‘What want bury her way?’ said Cattiwow. He took his broad-axe went log tapping it. ‘She is sticked fast,’ said ‘Bunny’ Lewknor, managed team. Cattiwow unfastened five wise horses tug. They cocked ears forward, looked, shook themselves. ‘I believe Sailor knows,’ Dan whispered Una. ‘He do,’ said man behind them. He dressed flour sacks like others, he leaned his broad-axe, children, knew wood-gangs, knew he stranger. In his size oily hairiness he might Bunny Lewknor’s brother, except his brown eyes soft spaniel’s, his rounded black beard, beginning close them, reminded Una walrus ‘The Walrus Carpenter.’ ‘Do not he justabout know?’ he said shyly, shifted one foot other. ‘Yes. “What Cattiwow cannot get woods must roots growing her.”’ Dan heard old Hobden say days before. At minute Puck pranced up, picking his way pools black water ling. ‘Look out!’ cried Una, jumping forward. ‘He will see you, Puck!’ ‘Me Mus’ Robin pretty middlin’ well acquainted,’ man answered smile made forget walruses. ‘This Simon Cheyneys,’ Puck began, cleared his throat. ‘Shipbuilder Rye Port; burgess said town, only--’ ‘Oh, look! Look ye! That is knowing one,’ said man. Cattiwow fastened his team thin end log, moving his whip till stood right angles it, heading downhill. Then he grunted. The horses took strain, beginning Sailor next log, like tug-of-war team, dropped almost knees. The log shifted nail’s breadth clinging dirt, noise giant’s kiss. ‘You are getting her!’ Simon Cheyneys slapped his knee. ‘Hing on! Hing on, lads, she will master ye! Ah!’ Sailor’s left hind hoof slipped heather-tuft. One men whipped his sack apron spread down. They saw Sailor feel it, recover. Still log hung, team grunted despair. ‘Hai!’ shouted Cattiwow, brought his dreadful whip twice across Sailor’s loins crack shot-gun. The horse almost screamed he pulled extra last ounce he know him. The thin end log left dirt rasped dry gravel. The butt ground round like buffalo his wallow. Quick axe-cut, Lewknor snapped his five horses, sliding, trampling, jingling, snorting, whole thing heather. ‘Dat’s first time I have knowed lay Sailor--to hurt him,’ said Lewknor. ‘It is,’ said Cattiwow, passed his hand two wheals. ‘But I would ha’ laid brother open pinch. Now we will twitch her hill piece--she lies right--and get her home low road. My team’ll it, Bunny; bring tug along. Mind out!’ He spoke horses, tightened chains. The great log half rolled over, slowly drew sight downhill, followed wood-gang timber-tug. In half minute nothing see deserted hollow torn-up dirt, birch undergrowth still shaking, water draining back hoof-prints. ‘Ye heard him?’ Simon Cheyneys asked. ‘He cherished his horse, he would ha’ laid open pinch.’ ‘Not his advantage,’ said Puck quickly. ‘It Was shift log.’ ‘I reckon every man born woman his log shift world--if you are hintin’ Frankie’s doings. He never hit beyond reason without reason,’ said Simon. ‘I never said word Frankie,’ Puck retorted, wink children. ‘An’ I did, lie mouth contest say-so, seeing you--’ ‘Why do not lie mouth, seeing I first knowed Frankie he was?’ The burly sack-clad man puffed cool little Puck. ‘Yes, first set poison him--Frankie--on high seas--’ Simon’s angry face changed sheepish grin. He waggled his immense hands, Puck stood laughed mercilessly. ‘But let tell you, Mus’ Robin,’ he pleaded. ‘I have heard tale. Tell children here. Look, Dan! Look, Una!’---Puck’s straight brown finger levelled like arrow. ‘There is man ever tried poison Sir Francis Drake!’ ‘Oh, Mus’ Robin! ‘Tidn’t fair. You have ‘vantage us upbringin’s hundreds years.

But sure, little maid?’ ‘Because--because he does not look like it,’ said Una stoutly. ‘I thank you,’ said Simon Una. ‘I--I always trustable-like children let alone, double handful mischief.’ He pretended heave his axe Puck; his shyness overtook afresh. ‘Where know Sir Francis Drake?’ said Dan, liking called child. ‘At Rye Port, sure,’ said Simon, seeing Dan’s bewilderment, repeated it. ‘Yes, look here,’ said Dan. ‘“Drake he Devon man.” The song says so.’ ‘“And ruled Devon seas,”’ Una went on. ‘That is I thinking--if do not mind.’ Simon Cheyneys seemed mind much indeed, he swelled silence Puck laughed. ‘Hutt!’ he burst last, ‘I have heard talk too. If listen West Country folk, you will listen pack lies. I believe Frankie born somewhere west among Shires, his father run Frankie baby, neighbours wishful kill him, d’ye see? He run Chatham, old Parson Drake did, an’ Frankie brought old hulks ship moored Medway river, might ha’ Rother. Brought sea, might say, he could walk land--nigh Chatham Kent. And are not Kent back-door Sussex? And do not make Frankie Sussex? OF course do. Devon man! Bah! Those West Country boats they are always fishin’ folks’ water.’ ‘I beg pardon,’ said Dan. ‘I am sorry. ‘No call sorry. You have misled. I met Frankie Rye Port Uncle, shipbuilder there, pushed his wharf-edge Frankie’s ship. Frankie put Chatham his rudder splutted, man’s arm--Moon’s ‘ud be--broken tiller. “Take boy aboard an’ drown him,” says Uncle, “and I will mend rudder-piece love.” ‘What Uncle want drowned for?’ said Una. ‘That his fashion say-so, Mus’ Robin. I would foolishness head ships could builded iron. Yes--iron ships! I would made liddle toy one iron plates beat thin--and she floated wonder! But Uncle, bein’ burgess Rye, shipbuilder, he ‘prenticed Frankie fetchin’ trade, cure foolishness.’ ‘What fetchin’ trade?’ Dan interrupted. ‘Fetchin’ poor Flemishers Dutchmen Low Countries England. The King Spain, d’ye see, he burnin’ ‘them parts, make ‘them Papishers, Frankie he fetched ‘them away parts, risky trade was. His master would not never touch he lived, he left his ship Frankie he died, Frankie turned her fetchin’ trade.

Frankie fled inshore smack beach, till he atop first breakers. Then he hove his anchor out, nigh tore bows off, twitched us round end-for-end wind, d’ye see, an’ clawed sands like drunk man rubbin’ along tavern bench. When could see, Spanisher laid flat along breakers snows whitening his wet belly. He thought he could go Frankie went.’ ‘What happened crew?’ said Una. ‘We did not stop,’ Simon answered. ‘There liddle new baby hold, mother she wanted get dry bed middlin’ quick. We runned Dover, said nothing.’ ‘Was Sir Francis Drake much pleased?’ ‘Heart alive, maid, he would head his name days. He outrageous, valiant, crop-haired, tutt-mouthed boy, roarin’ an’ narrer seas, his beard yet quilted out. He made laughing-stock everything day, he would hold lives bight his arm besom-black night among Dutch sands; we would ha’ jumped overside behove one time, us.’ ‘Then try poison him?’ Una asked wickedly, Simon hung his head like shy child. ‘Oh, he set make pudden, cook hurted.

Moon he chawed chammed his piece, Frankie chawed chammed his’n, and--no words it--he took ear an’ walked bow-end, an’ an’ Moon hove pudden bowsprit gub gub, something cruel hard!’ Simon rubbed his hairy cheek. ‘“Nex’ time bring anything,” says Frankie, “you bring cannon-shot an’ I will know I am getting.” But poisonin’--’ He stopped, children laughed so. ‘Of course did not,’ said Una. ‘Oh, Simon, like you!’ ‘I always likeable children.’ His smile crinkled hair round his eyes. ‘Simple Simon used call yard gates.’ ‘Did Sir Francis mock you?’ Dan asked. ‘Ah, no. He gentle-born. Laugh he did--he always laughing--but hurt feather. An’ I loved ‘en. I loved ‘en England knew ‘en, Queen Bess she broke his heart.’ ‘But he had not really done anything knew him, he?’ Una insisted. ‘Armadas things, I mean.’ Simon pointed scars scrapes left Cattiwow’s great log. ‘You tell good ship’s timber never done nothing winds weathers since her up-springing, I will confess ye young Frankie never done nothing neither. Nothing? He adventured suffered made shift Dutch sands much one month ever he occasion half-year high seas afterwards. An’ his tools?

We mostly do--even we are grown. But bein’ Frankie, he took good care find beforehand his fortune might be. Had I rightly ought tell ‘them piece?’ Simon turned Puck, nodded. ‘My Mother, she fair woman, Aunt, her sister, she gifts inheritance laid her,’ Simon began. ‘Oh, that will never do,’ cried Puck, children stared blankly. ‘Do remember Robin promised Widow Whitgift long her blood get lasted?’ [See ‘Dymchurch Flit’ PUCK OF POOK’S HILL.] ‘Yes. There always one could see farther millstone most,’ Dan answered promptly. ‘Well, Simon’s Aunt’s mother,’ said Puck slowly, ‘married Widow’s blind son Marsh, Simon’s Aunt one chosen see farthest millstones. Do understand?’ ‘That I gettin’ at,’ said Simon, ‘but you are desperate quick. My Aunt she knew comin’ people. My Uncle burgess Rye, he counted things odious, Aunt she could not got practise her gifts hardly all, hurted her head week after-wards; Frankie heard she ‘them, he nothing till she foretold him--till she looked his hand tell his fortune, d’ye see? One time Rye she come aboard shirt apples, he fair beazled life her it. ‘“Oh, you will twice wed, die childless,” she says, pushes his hand away. ‘“That is woman’s part,” he says. “What will come me-to me?” an’ he thrusts back her nose. ‘“Gold--gold, past belief counting,” she says. “Let go me, lad.” ‘“Sink gold!” he says. “What will I do, mother?” He coaxed her like woman could well withstand. I have seen ‘them--even sea-sick. ‘“If it,” she says last, “you shall it. You will many things, eating drinking dead man beyond world’s end least them.

Where is Sim’s shirt?” ‘He could not fetch her, come cabin, he stood mazed-like tiller, playing apple. ‘“My Sorrow!” says Aunt; “d’ye see that? The great world lying his hand, liddle round like apple.” ‘“Why, ‘it is one gived him,” I says. ‘“To sure,” she says. “‘It Is apple,” she went ashore her hand her head. It always hurted her show her gifts. Him puzzled talk plenty. It sticked his mind quite extravagant. The next time slipped fetchin’ trade, met Mus’ Stenning’s boat Calais sands; he warned us Spanishers shut Dutch ports us English, galliwopses picking boats like flies hogs’ backs.

We left bare seas conquest in. ‘“Looks like road going shut pretty soon,” says Frankie, humourin’ her tiller. “I will open one Aunt foretold of.” ‘“The Spanisher’s crowdin’ us middlin’ quick,” I says. “No odds,” says Frankie, “he will inshore tide him. Did Aunt say I quiet grave ever?” ‘“Till iron ships sailed dry land,” I says. ‘“That is foolishness,” he says. “Who cares Frankie Drake makes hole water twenty years now?” ‘The Spanisher kept muckin’ canvas.

There is knowin’ stray shots may hit.” So I came rail, leaned it, Spanisher he ruffled round wind, his port-lids opened red inside. ‘“Now what will happen road do not let lie quiet grave?” he says. “Does Aunt mean there is two roads found kept open--or she mean?

I have never even drawed draft one pleasure evenings.’ Simon smiled all. ‘Whitgift blood terrible resolute--on she-side,’ said Puck. ‘Did not You ever see Sir Francis Drake again?’ Dan asked. ‘With one thing another, made burgess Rye, I never clapped eyes next twenty years.

THE TREE OF JUSTICE The Ballad Minepit Shaw About time taverns shut And men buy beer, Two lads went keepers’ hut To steal Lord Pelham’s deer.

They took ran across fern, Their crossbows hand, Till met man green lantern That called bade ‘them stand. ‘What doing, O Flesh Blood, And what is foolish will, That must break Minepit Wood And wake Folk Hill?’ ‘Oh, we have broke Lord Pelham’s park, And killed Lord Pelham’s deer, And ever heard little dog bark You will know come here!’ ‘We ask let us go way, As fast flee, For ever heard bloodhound bay, You will know pressed be.’ ‘Oh, lay crossbows bank And drop knife hand, And though hounds flank I will save stand!’ They laid crossbows bank, They threw knives wood, And ground opened sank And saved ‘them stood. ‘Oh, what is roaring ears That strikes us well-nigh dumb?’ ‘Oh, things appears According come.’ ‘What stars eyes That strike us well-nigh blind?’ ‘Oh, things arise According find.’ ‘And why is bed hard bones Excepting it is cold?’ ‘Oh, that is precious stones Excepting ‘it is gold. ‘Think stand For I tell without fail, If have not got Fairyland You are Lewes Gaol.’ All night long thought it, And, come dawn, saw They would tumbled great old pit, At bottom Minepit Shaw.

The children set dinner find old Hobden, three months’ job Rough back Pound’s Wood. He promised get dormouse nest. The bright leaf Still clung beech coppice; long chestnut leaves lay orange ground, rides speckled scarlet-lipped sprouting acorns. They worked way short cuts edge Pound’s Wood, heard horse’s feet came beech Ridley keeper hangs vermin. The poor little fluffy bodies dangled branches--some perfectly good, dried twisted strips. ‘Three owls,’ said Dan, counting. ‘Two stoats, four jays, kestrel. That is ten since last week. Ridley’s beast.’ ‘In time sort tree bore heavier fruit.’ Sir Richard Dalyngridge reined his grey horse, Swallow, ride behind them. [This Norman knight met year PUCK OF POOK’S HILL. See ‘Young Men Manor,’ ‘The Knights Joyous Venture,’ ‘Old Men Pevensey,’ book.] ‘What play make?’ he asked. ‘Nothing, Sir. We are looking old Hobden,’ Dan replied.’He promised get us sleeper.’ ‘Sleeper? A DORMEUSE, say?’ ‘Yes, dormouse, Sir.’ ‘I understand. I passed woodman low grounds. Come!’ He wheeled ride again, pointed opening patch beech-stubs, chestnut, hazel, birch old Hobden would turn firewood, hop-poles, pea-boughs, house-faggots spring. The old man busy beaver. Something laughed beneath thorn, Puck stole out, his finger his lip. ‘Look!’ he whispered. ‘Along spindle-trees.

He puts his rabbits faggots he is allowed take home. He will tell us ‘them tomorrow.’ ‘We breed day,’ Sir Richard replied, moved quietly, Puck his bridle, children either side close-trimmed beech stuff. ‘What them?’ said Dan, repassed Ridley’s terrible tree. ‘That!’ Sir Richard jerked his head toward dangling owls. ‘Not he!’ said Puck. ‘There never enough brute Norman hang man taking buck.’ ‘I--I cannot abide hear widows screech. But I horseback afoot?’ He dismounted lightly, tapped Swallow chest, wise thing backed instead turning narrow ride, put head little procession. He walked though woods belonged him. ‘I often told friends,’ he went on, ‘that Red William King Norman found dead forest he hunted.’ ‘D’you mean William Rufus?’ said Dan. ‘Yes,’ said Puck, kicking clump red toad-stools dead log. ‘For example, knight new Normandy,’ Sir Richard went on, ‘to Henry King granted manor Kent near by. He chose hang his forester’s son day deer-hunt he gave pleasure King.’ ‘Now would be?’ said Puck, scratched ear thoughtfully. ‘The summer year King Henry broke his brother Robert Normandy Tenchebrai fight. Our ships even Pevensey loading war.’ ‘What happened knight?’ Dan asked. ‘They found pinned ash, three arrows his leather coat. I worn mail day.’ ‘And see bloody?’ Dan continued. ‘Nay, I De Aquila Pevensey, counting horseshoes, arrow-sheaves, ale-barrels holds ships. The army waited King lead Robert Normandy, he sent word De Aquila he would hunt he set France.’ ‘Why King want hunt particularly?’ Una demanded. ‘If he gone straight France Kentish knight killed, men would said he feared slain like knight. It his duty show debonair his English people De Aquila’s duty see he took harm he it, But great burden! De Aquila, Hugh, I ceased work ships, scoured Honour Eagle--all De Aquila’s lands--to make fit, and, all, safe sport King. Look!’ The ride twisted, came top Pound’s Hill Wood. Sir Richard pointed swells beautiful, dappled Dallington, showed like woodcock’s breast valley. ‘Ye know forest?’ said he. ‘You ought see bluebells Spring!’ said Una. ‘I seen,’ said Sir Richard, gazing, stretched his hand. ‘Hugh’s work mine first move deer gently parts Dallington yonder, hold till King came. Next, must choose three hundred beaters drive deer stands within bowshot King. Here trouble! In mellay deer-drive Saxon peasant Norman King may come over-close other. The conquered love conquerors once. So needed sure men, village kindred would answer life, cattle, land harm come King. Ye see?’ ‘If one beaters shot King,’ said Puck, ‘Sir Richard wanted able punish man’s village. Then village would take care send good man.’ ‘So! So was. But, lest work easy, King done dread justice Salehurst, killing Kentish knight (twenty-six men he hanged, I heard), folk half mad fear began. It easier dig badger gone earth Saxon gone dumb-sullen. And atop misery old rumour waked Harold Saxon alive would bring deliverance us Normans. This happened every autumn since Santlache fight.’ ‘But King Harold killed Hastings,’ said Una. ‘So said, believed us Normans, Saxons always believed he would come again. That rumour make work easy.’ Sir Richard strode far slope wood, trees thin out. It fascinating watch he managed his long spurs among lumps blackened ling. ‘But it!’ he said. ‘After all, woman good man beat woods, mere word deer afoot makes cripples crones young again. De Aquila laughed Hugh told list beaters.

How! Ah! How! How-ah! Sa-how-ah!’ Puck bellowed without warning, Swallow bounded forward, ears cocked, nostrils cracking. ‘Hal-lal-lal-lal-la-hai-ie!’ Sir Richard answered high clear shout. The two voices joined swooping circles sound, heron rose red osier-bed them, circling though he kept time outcry. Swallow quivered swished his glorious tail. They stopped together note. A hoarse shout answered across bare woods. ‘That is old Hobden,’ said Una. ‘Small blame him. It his blood,’ said Puck. ‘Did beaters cry so, Sir Richard?’ ‘My faith, forgot else.

They followed deer edge open till first flight wild arrows stands flew fair them. ‘I cried, “‘Ware shot! ‘Ware shot!” knot young knights new Normandy, strayed away Grand Stand, turned about, mere sport loosed line shouting: “‘Ware Santlache arrows! ‘Ware Santlache arrows!” A jest, I grant you, sharp.

So, next beat, Hugh I assembled called beaters name, steady them. The greater part knew, among Netherfield men I saw old, old man, dress pilgrim. ‘The Clerk Netherfield said he well known repute twenty years witless man journeyed without rest shrines England. The old man sits, Saxon fashion, head fists. We Normans rest chin left palm. ‘“Who answers him?” said I. “If he fails his duty, pay his fine?” ‘“Who pay fine?” pilgrim said. “I asked Saints England forty years, less three months nine days! They answered!” When he lifted his thin face I saw he one-eyed, frail rush. ‘“Nay, but, Father,” I said, “to hast thou commended thyself-?” He shook his head, I spoke Saxon: “Whose man art thou?” ‘“I think I writing Rahere, King’s jester,” said he while. “I am, I suppose, Rahere’s man.” ‘He pulled writing his scrip, Hugh, coming up, read it. ‘It set pilgrim Rahere’s man, Rahere King’s jester. There Latin writ back. ‘“What plague conjuration’s here?” said Hugh, turning over. “Pum-quum-sum oc-occ.

Here is Rahere’s name writ, there is Rahere’s red cockscomb mark drawn cannot read.” He looked slyly me. ‘“Then read it,” said I, “and show thy learning.” He vain little man, he gave us much mouthing. ‘“The charm, I think Virgilius Sorcerer, says: ‘When thou art dead, Minos’ (which heathen judge) ‘has doomed thee, neither cunning, speechcraft, good works restore thee!’ A terrible thing! It denies mercy man’s soul!” ‘“Does serve?” said pilgrim, plucking Hugh’s cloak. “Oh, man King’s blood, cover me?” ‘Hugh Earl Godwin’s blood, Sussex knew it, though Saxon dared call kingly Norman’s hearing. There one King. ‘“It serves,” said Hugh. “But day long hot. Better rest here. We go forward now.” ‘“No, I keep thee, kinsman,” he answered like child. He indeed childish great age. ‘The line moved bowshot De Aquila’s great horn blew halt, soon young Fulke--our false Fulke’s son--yes, imp lit straw Pevensey Castle [See ‘Old Men Pevensey’ PUCK OF POOK’S HILL.]--came thundering woodway. ‘“Uncle,” said he (though he man grown, he called Uncle), “those young Norman fools shot morn saying beaters cried treason King.

There heavy fines his eye, I hilt, Uncle!” ‘When boy fled back, Hugh said me: “It Rahere’s witless man cried, ‘’Ware Red William’s arrow!’ I heard him, Clerk Netherfield.” ‘“Then Rahere must answer King his man,” said I. “Keep till I send,” I hastened down. ‘The King De Aquila Grand Stand Welansford valley yonder.

So, slowly, Rahere King’s jester straddled edge planks, looked us, rubbing his chin. Loose-knit, cropped hair, sad priest’s face, his cockscomb cap, he could twist like strip wet leather.

He kneeled instant pardon, fell sideways, crying: “His legs! Oh, his long, waving red legs he went backward!” ‘Like storm breaking, grave King laughed,--stamped reeled laughter till stand shook. So, like storm, strange thing passed! ‘He wiped his eyes, signed De Aquila let drive come on. ‘When deer broke, pleased King shot shelter stand, ride hurt beasts Red William would done. Most vilely his knights barons shot! ‘De Aquila kept beside him, I saw Hugh till evening. We two little hut boughs camp, I went wash great supper, dusk I heard Hugh couch. ‘“Wearied, Hugh?” said I. ‘“A little,” he says. “I driven Saxon deer day Norman King, enough Earl Godwin’s blood left sicken work. Wait awhile torch.” ‘I waited then, I thought I heard sob.’ ‘Poor Hugh! Was he tired?’ said Una. ‘Hobden says beating hard work sometimes.’ ‘I think tale getting like woods,’ said Dan, ‘darker twistier every minute.’ Sir Richard walked he talked, though children thought knew woods well enough, felt little lost. ‘A dark tale enough,’ says Sir Richard, ‘but end black. When washed, went wait King meat great pavilion. Just trumpets blew Entry--all guests upstanding--long Rahere comes posturing Hugh, strikes his bauble-bladder. ‘“Here is heavy heart joyous meal!” he says. “But man must his black hour would merit laughing?

Oh, Saints, punishment King!” smites his hands together. ‘“Go--go fight dark,” says Rahere, “and thy Saxon Saints reward thee thy pity fool.” He pushed pavilion, Hugh lurched away like one drunk.’ ‘But why?’ said Una. ‘I do not understand.’ ‘Ah, indeed? Live long enough, maiden, shall know meaning many why is.’ Sir Richard smiled. ‘I wondered too, duty wait King High Table glitter stir. ‘He spoke his thanks sport I helped show him, he learned De Aquila enough folk castle Normandy graciously feign he knew loved brother there. (This, also, part king’s work.) Many great men sat High Table--chosen King wits, birth. I forgotten names, faces I saw one night. But’--Sir Richard turned his stride--‘but Rahere, flaming black scarlet among guests, hollow his dark cheek flushed wine--long, laughing Rahere, stricken sadness his face he twisting about--Rahere I shall never forget. ‘At King’s outgoing De Aquila bade follow him, his great bishops two great barons, little pavilion. We devised jugglers dances Court’s sport; Henry loved talk gravely grave men, De Aquila told travels world’s end. We fire apple-wood, sweet incense,--and curtains door looped up, could hear music see lights shining mail dresses. ‘Rahere lay behind King’s chair. The questions he darted forth shrewd flames. I telling fight apes, ye called them, world’s end.

Fetch Saxon knight.” ‘“Pest it,” said Rahere. “Who would King’s jester? I will bring him, Brother, you will see none home-brewed bishops taste wine I away.” So he jingled forth men-at-arms door. ‘Henry made many bishops England without Pope’s leave. I know rights matter, Rahere dared jest it. We waited King’s next word. ‘“I think Rahere jealous you,” said he, smiling, Nigel Ely. He one bishop; William Exeter, other--Wal-wist Saxons called him--laughed long. “Rahere priest heart. Shall I make bishop, De Aquila?” says King. ‘“There might worse,” said Lord Pevensey. “Rahere would never Anselm done.” ‘This Anselm, Archbishop Canterbury, gone raging Pope Rome, Henry would make bishops without his leave either. I knew rights it, De Aquila did, King laughed. ‘“Anselm means harm. He monk, bishop,” said King. “I will never quarrel Anselm his Pope till quarrel England. If keep King’s peace till son comes rule, man lightly quarrel England.” ‘“Amen,” said De Aquila. “But King’s peace ends King dies.” ‘That true. The King’s peace dies King. The custom laws outlaw, men till new King chosen. ‘“I amend that,” said King hotly. “I though King, son, grandson slain one day, still King’s peace hold England! What man his mere death must upheave people? We must Law.” ‘“Truth,” said William Exeter; he would said word King. ‘The two great barons behind said nothing. This teaching clean stomachs, King’s peace ends, great barons go war increase lands. At instant heard Rahere’s voice returning, scurril Saxon rhyme William Exeter: ‘“Well wist Wal-wist lay his fortune When he fawned King his crozier,” amid laughter he burst in, one arm round Hugh, one round old pilgrim Netherfield. ‘“Here knight, Brother,” said he, “and better disport company, fool. Hold up, Saxon Samson, gates Gaza clean carried away!” ‘Hugh broke loose, white sick, staggered side; old man blinked upon company. ‘We looked King, he smiled. ‘“Rahere promised he would show sport supper cover his morning’s offence,” said he De Aquila. “So thy man, Rahere?” ‘“Even so,” said Rahere. “My man he been, protection he taken, ever since I found gallows Stamford Bridge telling kites atop he was--Harold England!” ‘There great silence upon last strange words, Hugh hid his face shoulder, woman-fashion. ‘“It cruel true,” he whispered me. “The old man proved beat left, hut even now. It Harold, King!” ‘De Aquila crept forward. He walked man swallowed. ‘“Bones Saints!” said he, staring. ‘“Many stray shot goes well home,” said Rahere. ‘The old man flinched arrow. “Why hurt still?” he said Saxon. “It bones Saints I promised I would give England Great Duke.” He turns us crying, shrilly: “Thanes, he caught Rouen--a lifetime ago. If I promised, I lain life. What else could I done? I lain strait prison life none less. There need throw stones me.” He guarded his face his arms, shivered. “Now his madness strike down,” said Rahere. “Cast evil spirit, one new bishops.” ‘Said William Exeter: “Harold slain Santlache fight. All world knows it.” ‘“I think man must forgotten,” said Rahere. “Be comforted, Father. Thou wast well slain Hastings forty years gone, less three months nine days. Tell King.” ‘The man uncovered his face. “I thought would stone me,” he said. “I know I spoke King.” He came his full towering height--no mean man, frail beyond belief. ‘The King turned tables, held his cup wine. The old man drank, beckoned behind him, and, Normans, Hugh bore away empty cup, Saxon-fashion, upon knee. “It Harold!” said De Aquila. “His stiff-necked blood kneels serve him. “Be so,” said Henry. “Sit, then, thou hast Harold England.” ‘The madman sat, hard, dark Henry looked half-shut eyes. We others stared like oxen, De Aquila, watched Rahere I seen watch far sail sea. ‘The wine warmth cast old man dream. His white head bowed; his hands hung. His eye indeed opened, mind shut. When he stretched his feet, scurfed road-cut like slave’s. ‘“Ah, Rahere,” cried Hugh, “why hast thou shown thus? Better let die shame him--and me!” ‘“Shame thee?” said King. “Would baron mine kneel I witless, discrowned, alone, Harold throne?” ‘“No,” said Rahere. “I sole fool might it, Brother, unless”--he pointed De Aquila, he met day--“yonder tough Norman crab kept company. But, Sir Hugh, I mean shame him. He hath somewhat punished through, maybe, little fault his own.” ‘“Yet he lied Father, Conqueror,” said King, old man flinched his sleep. ‘“Maybe,” said Rahere, “but thy Brother Robert, whose throat purpose soon slit hands--” ‘“Hutt!” said King, laughing. “I will keep Robert table life’s guest I catch him. Robert means harm. It his cursed barons.” ‘“None less,” said Rahere, “Robert may say thou hast always spoken stark truth England. I hang many men bough, Brother.” ‘“And certain,” said Hugh, “that”--he pointed old man--“Harold forced make his promise Great Duke.” ‘“Very strongly, forced,” said De Aquila. He never pride Duke William’s dealings Harold Hastings. Yet, he said, one cannot build house straight sticks. ‘“No matter he forced,” said Henry, “England promised Father William Edward Confessor. Is so?” William Exeter nodded. “Harold confirmed promise Father bones Saints. Afterwards he broke his oath would taken England strong hand.” ‘“Oh! La! La!” Rahere rolled his eyes like girl. “That ever England taken strong hand!” ‘Seeing Red William Henry fashion snatched England Robert Normandy, others knew look. But De Aquila saved us quickly. ‘“Promise kept promise broken,” he said, “Harold came near enough breaking us Normans Santlache.” ‘“Was close fight, then?” said Henry. ‘“A hair would turned either way,” De Aquila answered. “His house-carles stood like rocks rain. Where wast thou, Hugh, it?” ‘“Among Godwin’s folk beneath Golden Dragon till front gave back, broke ranks follow,” said Hugh. ‘“But I bade stand! I bade stand! I knew deceit!” Harold waked, leaned forward one crying grave. ‘“Ah, see traitor betrayed!” said William Exeter, looked smile King. ‘“I made thee Bishop preach bidding,” said Henry; turning Harold, “Tell us thy people fought us?” said he. “Their sons serve Brother Robert!” ‘The old man shook his head cunningly. “Na--Na--Na!” he cried. “I know better. Every time I tell tale men stone me. But, Thanes, I tell greater thing. Listen!” He told us many paces Saxon Saint’s shrine another shrine, many back Abbey Battle. ‘“Ay,” said he. “I trodden often even ten paces. I move swiftly. Harold Norway knows that, Tostig brother. They lie ease Stamford Bridge, Stamford Bridge Battle Abbey is--” he muttered many numbers forgot us. ‘“Ay,” said De Aquila, muse. “That man broke Harold Norway Stamford Bridge, came near breaking us Santlache--all within one month.” ‘“But he come alive Santlache fight?” asked King. “Ask him! Hast thou heard it, Rahere?” “Never. He says he stoned often telling tale. But he count Saxon Norman shrines till daylight,” said Rahere old man nodded proudly. ‘“My faith!” said Henry while. “I think even Father Great Duke would pity he could see him.” ‘“How he see?” said Rahere. ‘Hugh covered his face his sound hand. “Ah, hast thou shamed him?” he cried Rahere. ‘“No--no,” says old man, reaching pluck Rahere’s cape. “I Rahere’s man. None stone now,” he played bells scollops it. ‘“How he brought found him?” said King Rahere. ‘“You would held prisoner again--as Great Duke did,” Rahere answered. ‘“True,” said King. “He nothing except his name. Yet name might used stronger men trouble England. Yes. I must made life’s guest--as I shall make Robert.” ‘“I knew it,” said Rahere. “But man wandered mad wayside, none cared he called himself.” ‘“I learned cease talking stones flew,” says old man, Hugh groaned. ‘“Ye heard!” said Rahere. “Witless, landless, nameless, and, protection, masterless, he still make shift bide his doom open sky.” ‘“Then wherefore didst thou bring mock shame?” cried Hugh, beside woe. ‘“A right mock shame!” said William Exeter. ‘“Not me,” said Nigel Ely. “I see I tremble, I neither mock judge.” “Well spoken, Ely.” Rahere falls pure fool again. “I will pray thee I turn monk. Thou hast given thy blessing war two Christian brothers.” He meant war forward ‘twixt Henry Robert Normandy. “I charge you, Brother,” he says, wheeling King, “dost thou mock fool?” The King shook his head, smooth William Exeter. ‘“De Aquila, thou mock him?” Rahere jingled one another, old man smiled. ‘“By Bones Saints, I,” said Lord Pevensey. “I know dooms near he broke us Santlache.” ‘“Sir Hugh, excused question. But you, valiant, loyal, honourable, devout barons, Lords Man’s justice bounds, mock fool?” ‘He shook his bauble faces two barons whose names I forgotten. “Na--Na!” said, waved back foolishly enough. ‘He hies across staring, nodding Harold, speaks behind his chair. ‘“No man mocks thee, Who judges man? Henry England--Nigel--De Aquila! On souls, swift answer!” he cried. ‘None answered. We all--the King least--over-borne terrible scarlet-and-black wizard-jester. ‘“Well souls,” he said, wiping his brow. Next, shrill like woman: “Oh, come me!” Hugh ran forward hold Harold, slidden chair. ‘“Hearken,” said Rahere, his arm round Harold’s neck. “The King--his bishops--the knights--all world’s crazy chessboard neither mock judge thee. Take comfort thee, Harold England!” ‘Hugh heaved old man he smiled. ‘“Good comfort,” said Harold. “Tell again! I somewhat punished.” ‘Rahere hallooed his ear head rolled. We heard sigh, Nigel Ely stood forth, praying aloud. ‘“Out! I Norman!” Harold said clearly I speak now, he refuged Hugh’s sound shoulder, stretched out, lay still.’ ‘Dead?’ said Una, turning white face dusk. ‘That his good fortune.

They ducked narrow path close ash plantation. The children hurried forward, cutting corner charged full-abreast thorn-faggot old Hobden carrying home his back. ‘My! My!’ said he. ‘Have scratted face, Miss Una?’ ‘Sorry! It is right,’ said Una, rubbing her nose. ‘How many rabbits get today?’ ‘That is tellin’!’ old man grinned he re-hoisted his faggot. ‘I reckon Mus’ Ridley he have got rheumatism along lyin’ dik see I did not snap any.
