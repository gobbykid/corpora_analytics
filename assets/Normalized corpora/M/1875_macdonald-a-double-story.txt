 A DOUBLE STORY I. There certain country things used go rather oddly. For instance, could never tell whether going rain hail, whether milk going turn sour. It impossible say whether next baby would boy, girl, even, he week old, whether he would wake sweet-tempered cross. In strict accordance peculiar nature country uncertainties, came pass one day, midst shower rain might well called golden, seeing sun, shining fell, turned drops molten topazes, every drop good grain golden corn, yellow cowslip, buttercup, dandelion least;—while splendid rain falling, I say, musical patter upon great leaves horse-chestnuts, hung like Vandyke collars necks creamy, red-spotted blossoms, leaves sycamores, looking blood veins, multitude flowers, stood boldly held cups catch share, others cowered down, laughing, soft patting blows heavy warm drops;—while lovely rain washing air clean motes, bad odors, poison-seeds escaped prisons long drought;—while fell, splashing sparkling, hum, rush, soft clashing—but stop! I stealing, I find, only, clumsy hands spoiling I steal:— “O Rain! dull twofold sound, The clash hard by, murmur round:” —there! take it, Mr. Coleridge;—while, I saying, lovely little rivers whose fountains clouds, cut channels air, make sweet noises rubbing banks hurry down, length pulled sudden, musical plash, heart odorous flower, first gasps sighs blissful scent, bald head stone never says, Thank you;—while sheep felt blessing them, though could never reach skins depth long wool, veriest hedgehog—I mean one longest spikes—came spiked impale many drops he could;—while rain thus falling, leaves, flowers, sheep, cattle, hedgehog, busily receiving golden rain, something happened. It great battle, earthquake, coronation, something important put together. _A baby-girl born;_ her father king; her mother queen; her uncles aunts princes princesses; her first-cousins dukes duchesses; one her second-cousins less marquis marchioness, third-cousins less earl countess: countess care count. So little girl Somebody; yet that, strange say, first thing she cry. I told strange country. As she grew up, everybody her his best convince her she Somebody; girl herself easily persuaded she quite forgot anybody ever told her so, took fundamental, innate, primary, first-born, self-evident, necessary, incontrovertible idea principle _she Somebody_. And far deny it. I even go far assert odd country huge number Somebodies. Indeed, one oddities every boy girl it, rather ready think he she Somebody; worst princess never thought one Somebody—and herself. Far away north country, side bleak hill, horse-chestnut sycamore never seen, meadows rich buttercups, steep, rough, breezy slopes, covered dry prickly furze flowers red gold, moister, softer broom flowers yellow gold, great sweeps purple heather, mixed bilberries, crowberries, cranberries—no, I wrong: nothing yet furze-blossoms; rest waiting behind doors till called; full, slow-gliding river meadow-sweet along oozy banks, little brook there, dashed past without moment say, “How do?”—there (would believe it?) cloud dropping golden rain queen’s new baby dashing huge fierce handfuls hail upon hills, force flew spinning rocks stones, went burrowing sheep’s wool, stung cheeks chin shepherd sharp spiteful little blows, made his dog wink whine bounded his hard wise head, long sagacious nose; only, dropped plump chimney, fell hissing little fire, caught then, clever little fire soon sent chimney again, good deal swollen, harmless enough while, (what think?) among hailstones, heather, cold mountain air, another little girl born, shepherd her father, shepherdess her mother, good many her kindred too, thought Somebody. She uncle aunt less shepherd dairymaid, cousin, less farm-laborer, second-cousin less grocer, count farther. And yet (would believe it?) she cried first thing. It _was_ odd country! And, still surprising, shepherd shepherdess dairymaids laborers bit wiser king queen dukes marquises earls; too, one all, constantly taught little woman she Somebody, she also forgot great many Somebodies besides herself world. It was, indeed, peculiar country, different ours—so different, reader must much surprised I add amazing fact, inhabitants, instead enjoying things had, always wanting things not, often even things least likely ever could have. The grown men women like this, reason astonished Princess Rosamond—the name her parents gave her means _Rose World_—should grow like them, wanting every thing she could every thing she could not have. The things she could great many many, her foolish parents always gave her could; still remained things could not give her, common king queen. They could give her lighted candle she cried it, managed much care she burn her fingers set her frock fire; she cried moon, could give her. They worst thing possible, instead, however; pretended could not. They got her thin disc brilliantly polished silver, near size moon could agree upon; and, time she delighted. But, unfortunately, one evening she made discovery her moon little peculiar, inasmuch she could shine dark. Her nurse happened snuff candles she playing it; instantly came shriek rage, her moon vanished. Presently, opening curtains, she caught sight real moon, far away sky, shining quite calmly, she time; her rage increased degree passed fit, I know might come it. As she grew still same, difference, must she every thing, she got tired every thing almost soon she it. There accumulation things her nursery schoolroom bedroom perfectly appalling. Her mother’s wardrobes almost useless her, packed things she never took notice. When she five years old, gave her splendid gold repeater, close set diamonds rubies, back one crust gems. In one her little tempers, called her hideously ugly rages, she dashed back chimney, never gave single tick; diamonds went ash-pit. As she grew older still, she became fond animals, way brought much pleasure, herself much satisfaction. When angry, she would beat them, try pull pieces, soon she became little used them, would neglect altogether. Then, could, would run away, she furious. Some white mice, she ceased feeding altogether, so; soon palace swarming white mice. Their red eyes might seen glowing, white skins gleaming, every dark corner; came king’s finding nest his second-best crown, he angry ordered drowned. The princess heard it, however, raised clamor, left run away themselves; poor king wear his best crown every day till then. Nothing princess’s property, whether she cared not, meddled with. Of course, she grew, she grew worse; she never tried grow better. She became peevish fretful every day—dissatisfied she had, around her, constantly wishing things general different. She found fault every thing everybody, happened, grew disagreeable every one her. At last, she nearly killed her nurse, succeeded hanging herself, miserable morning night, her parents thought time something. A long way palace, heart deep wood pine-trees, lived wise woman. In countries she would called witch; would mistake, she never thing wicked, power witch could have. As her fame spread country, king heard her; and, thinking she might perhaps able suggest something, sent her. In dead night, lest princess know it, king’s messenger brought palace tall woman, muffled head foot cloak black cloth. In presence Majesties, king, her honor, requested her sit; she declined, stood waiting hear say. Nor she wait long, almost instantly began tell her dreadful trouble child; first king talking, queen interposing yet dreadful fact, times letting torrent words together, anxious show wise woman perplexity real, daughter terrible one. For long appeared sign approaching pause. But wise woman stood patiently folded her black cloak, listened without word motion. At length silence fell; talked tired, could think thing add list child’s enormities. After minute, wise woman unfolded her arms; her cloak dropping open front, disclosed garment made strange stuff, old poet knew her well thus described:— “All lilly white, withoutten spot pride, That seemd like silke silver woven neare; But neither silke silver therein appeare.” “How badly treated her!” said wise woman. “Poor child!” “Treated her badly?” gasped king. “She wicked child,” said queen; glared indignation. “Yes, indeed!” returned wise woman. “She naughty indeed, she must made feel; half fault too.” “What!” stammered king. “Have not given her every mortal thing she wanted?” “Surely,” said wise woman: “what else could killed her? You given her things sort. But far dull understand me.” “You polite,” remarked king, royal sarcasm his thin, straight lips. The wise woman made answer beyond deep sigh; king queen sat silent also anger, glaring wise woman. The silence lasted minute, wise woman folded her cloak around her, her shining garment vanished like moon great cloud comes her. Yet another minute passed silence endured, smouldering wrath king queen choked channels speech. Then wise woman turned her back them, stood. At this, rage king broke forth; he cried queen, stammering his fierceness,— “How old hag teach Rosamond good manners? She knows nothing herself! Look she stands!—actually her back us.” At word wise woman walked room. The great folding doors fell behind her; moment king queen quarrelling like apes blame her departure. Before altercation over, lasted till early morning, rushed Rosamond, clutching her hand poor little white rabbit, she fond, which, would come her she called it, she pulling handfuls fur attempt tear squealing, pink-eared, red-eyed thing pieces. “Rosa, Rosa_mond!_” cried queen; whereupon Rosamond threw rabbit her mother’s face. The king started fury, ran seize her. She darted shrieking room. The king rushed her; but, his amazement, she nowhere seen: huge hall empty.—No: outside door, close threshold, her back it, sat figure wise woman, muffled her dark cloak, her head bowed her knees. As king stood looking her, she rose slowly, crossed hall, walked away marble staircase. The king called her; she never turned her head, gave least sign she heard him. So quietly she pass wide marble stair, king persuaded he seen shadow gliding across white steps. For princess, she nowhere found. The queen went hysterics; rabbit ran away. The king sent messengers every direction, vain. In short time palace quiet—as quiet used princess born. The king queen cried little then, hearts parents country strangely fashioned; yet I afraid first movement hearts would jump terror ears heard voice Rosamond one corridors. As rest household, could made single tear amongst them. They thought, whatever might princess, was, every one else, best thing could happened; become her, heads puzzled, hearts took interest question. The lord-chancellor alone idea it, he far wise utter it. II. The fact, plain, was, princess disappeared folds wise woman’s cloak. When she rushed room, wise woman caught her her bosom flung black garment around her. The princess struggled wildly, she fierce terror, screamed loud choking fright would permit her; her father, standing door, looking upon wise woman, saw never movement cloak, tight she held her captor. He indeed aware angry crying, reminded his daughter; sounded far away, he took passion child street, outside palace-gates. Hence, unchallenged, wise woman carried princess marble stairs, palace-door, great flight steps outside, across paved court, brazen gates, along half-roused streets people opening shops, huge gates city, wide road, vanishing northwards; princess struggling screaming time, wise woman holding her tight. When length she tired struggle scream more, wise woman unfolded her cloak, set her down; princess saw light opened her swollen eyelids. There nothing sight she ever seen before. City palace disappeared. They upon wide road going straight on, ditch side it, behind widened great moat surrounding city. She cast terrified look wise woman’s face, gazed upon her gravely kindly. Now princess least understand kindness. She always took sign either partiality fear. So wise woman looked kindly upon her, she rushed her, butting her head like ram: folds cloak closed around wise woman; and, princess ran it, she found hard cloak bronze statue, fell back upon road great bruise her head. The wise woman lifted her again, put her cloak, she fell asleep, she awoke find she still carried on. When length wise woman stopped set her down, she saw around her bright moonlit night, wide heath, solitary houseless. Here she felt frightened before; her terror assuaged when, looking up, she saw stern, immovable countenance, cold eyes fixedly regarding her. All she knew world derived nursery-tales, she concluded wise woman ogress, carrying her home eat her. I already said princess was, time her life, low-minded creature, severity greater influence her kindness. She understood terror better far tenderness. When wise woman looked her thus, she fell her knees, held her hands her, crying,— “Oh, do not eat me! do not eat me!” Now best _she_ could do, sign she low creature. Think it—to kick kindness, kneel terror. But sternness face wise woman came heart feeling kindness shone before. The thing could save princess her hatefulness, she made mind somebody else her miserable Somebody. Without saying word, wise woman reached her hand, took one Rosamond’s, and, lifting her her feet, led her along moonlight. Every gush obstinacy would well heart princess, she would give great ill-tempered tug, pull her hand away; wise woman would gaze upon her look, she instantly sought hand she rejected, pure terror lest she eaten upon spot. And would walk again; wind blew folds cloak princess, she found soft her mother’s camel-hair shawl. After little wise woman began sing her, princess could help listening; soft wind amongst low dry bushes heath, rustle steps, trailing wise woman’s cloak, sounds beside. And song she sang:— Out cold, With thin-worn fold Of withered gold Around her rolled, Hangs air weary moon. She old, old, old; And her bones cold, And her tales told, And her things sold, And she breath croon. Like castaway clout, She quite shut out! She might call shout, But one Would ever call back, “Who is there?” There never hut, Not door shut, Not footpath rut, Long road short cut, Leading anywhere! She alone Like dog-picked bone, The poor old crone! She fain would groan, But she cannot find breath. She fire; But she built higher, And sat nigher Till she saw expire; And she cold death. She never smile All lonesome while. Oh mile mile, And never stile! And never tree stone! She tear: Afar anear It drear, But she care, Her heart dry bone. None come near her! No one cheer her! No one jeer her! No one hear her! Not thing lift hold! She always awake, But her heart break: She quake, Shiver, shake: The old woman cold. As strange song, crooning wailing tune wise woman sung. At first note almost, would thought she wanted frighten princess; indeed she did. For people _will_ naughty, frightened, expected like it. The princess grew angry, pulled her hand away, cried,— “_You_ ugly old woman. I hate you!” Therewith she stood still, expecting wise woman stop also, perhaps coax her go on: she did, she determined move step. But wise woman never even looked about: she kept walking steadily, pace before. Little Obstinate thought certain she would turn; she regarded herself much precious left behind. But wise woman went, she vanished away dim moonlight. Then princess perceived she left alone moon, looking her height her loneliness. She horribly frightened, began run wise woman, calling aloud. But song she heard came back sound her running feet,— All alone, Like dog-picked bone! again,— She might call shout, And one Would ever call back, “Who is there?” she screamed she ran. How she wished she knew old woman’s name, she might call her moonlight! But wise woman had, truth, heard first sound her running feet, stopped turned, waiting. What running crying, however, fall two she ran, princess never saw her she fell right her arms—and moment fresh rage; soon trouble princess always ready begin another. The wise woman therefore pushed her away, walked on; princess ran scolding storming her. She run till, fatigue, her rudeness ceased. Her heart gave way; she burst tears, ran silently weeping. A minute wise woman stooped, lifting her her arms, folded her cloak around her. Instantly she fell asleep, slept soft soundly she her bed. She slept till moon went down; she slept till sun rose up; she slept till he climbed topmost sky; she slept till he went again, poor old moon came peaking peering more: time wise woman went walking fast. And reached spot fir-trees came meet moonlight. At time princess awaked, popping her head folds wise woman’s cloak—a ugly little owlet she looked—saw entering wood. Now something awful every wood, especially moonlight; perhaps fir-wood awful woods. For one thing, let us little light through, rendering darkness little visible, were; trees go stretching away towards moon, look cared nothing creatures them—not like broad trees soft wide leaves that, darkness even, look sheltering. So princess blamed she much frightened. She hardly blamed either that, assured wise woman ogress carrying her her castle eat her up, she began kick scream violently, readers sort herself consider right natural thing do. The wrong her this—that she led bad life, she know good woman she saw her; took her one like herself, even she slept her arms. Immediately wise woman set her down, and, walking on, within paces vanished among trees. Then cries princess rent air, fir-trees never heeded her; one hard little needles gave single shiver noise she made. But creatures forest soon quite much interested her cries fir-trees indifferent them. They began hearken howl snuff about, run hither thither, grin white teeth, light green lamps eyes. In minute two whole army wolves hyenas rushing quarters pillar like stems fir-trees, place she stood calling them, without knowing it. The noise she made herself, however, prevented her hearing either howls soft pattering many trampling feet bounded fallen fir needles cones. One huge old wolf outsped rest—not he could run faster, experience he could exactly judge whence cries came, he shot wood, she caught sight last his lamping eyes coming swiftly nearer nearer. Terror silenced her. She stood her mouth open, she going eat wolf, she breath scream with, her tongue curled her mouth like withered frozen leaf. She could nothing stare coming monster. And he taking shorter bounds, measuring distance one final leap bring upon her, stepped wise woman behind tree she set princess down, caught wolf throat half-way his last spring, shook once, threw her dead. Then she turned towards princess, flung herself her arms, instantly lapped folds her cloak. But huge army wolves hyenas rushed like sea around them, whose waves leaped hoarse roar hollow yell wise woman. But she, like strong stately vessel, moved unhurt midst them. Ever leaped her cloak, dropped slunk away back crowd. Others ever succeeded, ever turn fell, drew back confounded. For time she walked attended assailed sides howling pack. Suddenly turned swept away, vanishing depths forest. She neither slackened hastened her step, went walking before. In little she unfolded her cloak, let princess look out. The firs ceased; lofty height moorland, stony bare dry, tufts heather small plants there. About heath, every side, lay forest, looking moonlight like cloud; forest, like shaven crown monk, rose bare moor walking. Presently, little way front them, princess espied whitewashed cottage, gleaming moon. As came nearer, she saw roof covered thatch, moss grown green. It simple, humble place, least terrible look at, yet, soon she saw it, her fear awoke, always, soon her fear awoke, trust princess fell dead sleep. Foolish useless she might time known it, she began kicking screaming, whereupon, yet more, wise woman set her heath, yards back cottage, saying only, “No one ever gets house knock door, ask come in,” disappeared round corner cottage, leaving princess alone moon—two white faces cone night. III. The moon stared princess, princess stared moon; moon best it, princess began cry. And question moon cottage. The princess thought she knew worst moon, she knew nothing cottage, therefore she would stay moon. Strange, not, she long wise woman, yet know _nothing_ cottage? As moon, she means know worst her, even, that, she fall asleep she could find her, old witch would certainly her best twist her face. But she scarcely sat moment longer she assailed sorts fresh fears. First all, soft wind blowing gently dry stalks heather thousands little bells raised sweet rustling, princess took hissing serpents, know she naughty long she could great many things tell good bad. Then nobody could deny there, round heath, like ring darkness, lay gloomy fir-wood, princess knew full of, every she thought she heard howling wolves hyenas. And could tell might break covert sweep like shadow across heath? Indeed, twice moment she fully persuaded she saw great beast coming leaping bounding moonlight her himself. She know single evil creature dared set foot heath, that, one so, would instant wither cease. If army rushed invade it, would melted away edge it, ceased like dying wave.—She even imagined moon slowly coming nearer nearer sky take her freeze her death her arms. The wise woman, too, she felt sure, although her cottage looked asleep, watching her little window. In this, however, she would quite right, she imagined enough—namely, wise woman watching _over_ her little window. But all, somehow, thought wise woman less frightful her terrors, length she began wonder whether might turn she ogress, rude, ill-bred, tyrannical, yet whole altogether ill-meaning person. Hardly possibility arisen her mind, she her feet: woman thing short ogress, her cottage must better horrible loneliness, nothing world stare; even ogress least shape look human being. She darted round end cottage find front. But, her surprise, she came another back, door seen. She tried farther end, still door. She must passed she ran—but no—neither gable side found. A cottage without door!—she rushed rage kicked wall her feet. But wall hard iron, hurt her sadly her gay silken slippers. She threw herself heath, came walls cottage every side, roared screamed rage. Suddenly, however, she remembered her screaming brought horde wolves hyenas her forest, and, ceasing once, lay still, gazing yet moon. And came thought her parents palace home. In her mind’s eye she saw her mother sitting her embroidery tears dropping upon it, her father staring fire he looking her glowing caverns. It true tears her side her naughtiness, she would cared straw; her forlorn condition somehow helped her understand grief lost her, great longing back her comfortable home, feeble flutter genuine love her parents awoke her heart well, she burst real tears—soft, mournful tears—very different rage disappointment she much used. And another remarkable thing moment she began love her father mother, she began wish see wise woman again. The idea her ogress vanished utterly, she thought her one take her moon, loneliness, terrors forest-haunted heath, hide her cottage even door horrid wolves howl against. But old woman—as princess called her, knowing her real name Wise Woman—had told her she must knock door: she door? But she bethought herself—that, she could she told, she could, least, part it: she could knock door, she could least knock—say wall, nothing else knock upon—and perhaps old woman would hear her, lift her window. Thereupon, she rose her feet, picking stone, began knock wall it. A loud noise result, she found she knocking door itself. For moment she feared old woman would offended, next, came voice, saying, “Who there?” The princess answered, “Please, old woman, I mean knock loud.” To came reply. Then princess knocked again, time her knuckles, voice came again, saying, “Who there?” And princess answered, “Rosamond.” Then second time silence. But princess soon ventured knock third time. “What want?” said voice. “Oh, please, let in!” said princess. “The moon keep staring me; I hear wolves wood.” Then door opened, princess entered. She looked around, saw nothing wise woman. It single bare little room, white deal table, old wooden chairs, fire fir-wood hearth, smoke smelt sweet, patch thick-growing heath one corner. Poor was, compared grand place Rosamond left, she felt little satisfaction she shut door, looked around her. And sufferings terrors she left outside, new kind tears she she would, love she begun feel her parents, trust she begun place wise woman, seemed her her soul grown larger sudden, she left days her childishness naughtiness far behind her. People ready think changed mood changed! Those good-tempered fine day, ill-tempered rains: selves days; one case, fine weather got them, rainy. Rosamond, she sat warming herself glow peat-fire, turning her mind passed, feeling pleasant change her feelings was, began degrees think good she grown, good she grown good, extremely good she must always she able grow good she felt she grown; she became absorbed her self-admiration never notice either fire dying, heap fir-cones lay corner near it. Suddenly, great wind came roaring chimney, scattered ashes floor; tremendous rain followed, fell hissing embers; moon swallowed up, darkness her. Then flash lightning, followed peal thunder, terrified princess, she cried aloud old woman, came answer her cry. Then her terror princess grew angry, saying herself, “She must somewhere place, else open door me?” began shout yell, call wise woman bad names she habit throwing her nurses. But came single sound reply. Strange say, princess never thought telling herself naughty she was, though would surely reasonable. On contrary, she thought she perfect right angry, she desperately ill used—and princess too? But wind howled on, rain kept pouring chimney, every lightning burst out, thunder rushed it, great lumbering sound could ever think catch swift light! At length princess grown angry, frightened, miserable, together, she jumped hurried cottage outstretched arms, trying find wise woman. But bad temper always makes people stupid, presently she struck her forehead blow something—she thought herself felt like old woman’s cloak—that she fell back—not floor, though, patch heather, felt soft pleasant bed palace. There, worn weeping rage, she soon fell fast asleep. She dreamed she old cold woman sky, home friends, nothing all, even pocket; wandering, wandering forever, desert blue sand, never get anywhere, never lie die. It use stopping look her, she forever look her she went on—never seeing thing, never expecting see thing! The shadow hope she was, she might slow degrees grow thinner thinner, last she wore away nothing all; alas! she could detect least sign she yet begun grow thinner. The hopelessness grew length unendurable she woke start. Seeing face wise woman bending her, she threw her arms around her neck held her mouth kissed. And kiss wise woman like rose-gardens Damascus. IV. The wise woman lifted her tenderly, washed dressed her far carefully even her nurse. Then she set her fire, prepared her breakfast. The princess hungry, bread milk good could be, she thought she never her life eaten thing nicer. Nevertheless, soon she began enough, she said herself,— “Ha! I see is! The old woman wants fatten me! That she gives nice creamy milk. She does not kill she is going kill then! She _is_ ogress, all!” Thereupon she laid her spoon, would eat another mouthful—only followed basin longing looks, wise woman carried away. When she stopped eating, her hostess knew exactly she thinking; one thing understand princess, quite another make princess understand her: would require time. For present she took notice, went affairs house, sweeping floor, brushing cobwebs, cleaning hearth, dusting table chairs, watering bed keep fresh alive—for she never one guest time, never would allow guest go sleep upon thing life it. All time she thus busied, she spoke word princess, which, princess, went confirm her notion her purposes. But whatever she might said would perverted princess yet stronger proof her evil designs, fancy her head would outweigh multitude facts another’s. She kept staring fire, never looked round see wise woman might doing. By she came close back her chair, said, “Rosamond!” But princess fallen one her sulky moods, shut herself her ugly Somebody; she never looked round even answered wise woman. “Rosamond,” she repeated, “I going out. If good girl, is, I tell you, I carry back father mother moment I return.” The princess take least notice. “Look me, Rosamond,” said wise woman. But Rosamond never moved—never even shrugged her shoulders—perhaps already her ears, could go farther. “I want help I tell you,” said wise woman. “Look me.” Still Rosamond motionless silent, saying herself, “I know she is after! She wants show her horrid teeth. But I will not look. I am going frightened senses please her.” “You better look, Rosamond. Have forgotten kissed morning?” But Rosamond regarded little throb affection momentary weakness deceitful ogress betrayed her, almost despised herself it. She one coaxed disagreeable. For such, wise woman awful punishment, she remembered princess ill brought up, therefore wished try her gentleness first. She stood silent moment, see effect her words might have. But Rosamond said herself,— “She wants fatten eat me.” And little since she looked wise woman’s loving eyes, thrown her arms round her neck, kissed her! “Well,” said wise woman gently, pausing long seemed possible she might bethink herself, “I must tell without; whoever listens her back turned, listens half, gets half help.” “She wants fatten me,” said princess. “You must keep cottage tidy I out. When I come back, I must see fire bright, hearth swept, kettle boiling; dust table chairs, windows clear, floor clean, heather blossom—which last comes sprinkling water three times day. When hungry, put hand hole wall, find meal.” “She wants fatten me,” said princess. “But account leave house till I come back,” continued wise woman, “or grievously repent it. Remember already gone reach it. Dangers lie around cottage mine; inside, safest place—in fact quite safe place country.” “She means eat me,” said princess, “and therefore wants frighten running away.” She heard voice more. Then, suddenly startled thought alone, she looked hastily her shoulder. The cottage indeed empty visible life. It soundless, too: even ticking clock flapping flame. The fire burned still smouldering-wise; company she had, she turned stare it. Soon she began grow weary nothing do. Then she remembered old woman, she called her, told her keep house tidy. “The miserable little pig-sty!” she said. “Where is use keeping hovel clean!” But truth she would glad employment, she told it, she unwilling; _are_ people—however unlikely may seem—who object thing reason required them. “I princess,” she said, “and improper ask thing.” She might judged quite suitable princess sweep away dust sit centre world dirt. But she ought, she would not. Perhaps she feared she gave her duty once, she might always—which true enough—for thing she specially born. Unable, however, feel quite comfortable resolve neglect it, she said herself, “I am sure there is time enough nasty job that!” sat on, watching fire burned away, glowing red casting white flakes, sinking lower lower hearth. By by, merely want something do, she would see old woman left her hole wall. But she put her hand she found nothing there, except dust she ought time wiped away. Never reflecting wise woman told her she would find food _when she hungry_, she flew one her furies, calling her cheat, thief, liar, ugly old witch, ogress, I know many wicked names besides. She raged she quite exhausted, fell fast asleep her chair. When she awoke fire out. By time she hungry; without looking hole, she began storm wise woman, labor she would doubt exhausted herself, something white caught her eye: corner napkin hanging hole wall. She bounded it, dinner her something strangely good—one her favorite dishes, better she ever tasted before. This might surely least changed her mood towards wise woman; she grumbled herself ought be, ate food, lay bed, never thinking fire, dust, water heather. The wind began moan cottage, grew louder louder, till great gust came chimney, scattered white ashes place. But princess time fast asleep, never woke till wind sunk silence. One consequences, however, sleeping one ought awake waking one ought asleep; princess awoke black midnight, found enough keep her awake. For although wind fallen, far terrible howling wildest wind cottage. Nor howling all; air full strange cries; everywhere she heard noise claws scratching house, seemed doors windows, crowded sounds, many directions. All night long she lay half swooning, yet listening hideous noises. But first glimmer morning ceased. Then she said herself, “How fortunate I woke! They would eaten I asleep.” The miserable little wretch actually talked she kept out! If she done her work day, she would slept terrors darkness, awaked fearless; whereas now, she storehouse her heart whole harvest agonies, reaped dun fields night! They neither wolves hyenas caused her dismay, creatures air, frightful still, which, soon smoke burning fir-wood ceased spread abroad, sun sufficient distance sky, lone cold woman out, came flying howling cottage, trying get every door window. Down chimney would got, heart fire always lay certain fir-cone, looked like solid gold red-hot, which, although might easily get covered ashes, quite invisible, continually glow fit kindle fir-cones world; kept horrible birds—some say claw tip every wing-feather—from tearing poor naughty princess pieces, gobbling her up. When she rose looked her, she dismayed see state cottage in. The fire out, windows dim wings claws dirty birds, bed she risen brown withered, half purple bells fallen. But she consoled herself she could set rights minutes—only she must breakfast first. And, sure enough, basin delicious bread milk ready her hole wall! After she eaten it, she felt comfortable, sat long time building castles air—till she actually hungry again, without done atom work. She ate again, idle again, ate again. Then grew dark, she went trembling bed, she remembered horrors last night. This time she never slept all, spent long hours grievous terror, noises worse before. She vowed she would pass another night hateful haunted old she would ugly women, witches, ogresses wide world. In morning, however, she fell asleep, slept late. Breakfast course her first thought, she could avoid work. It made her miserable, she feared consequences found undone. A minutes noon, she actually got up, took her pinafore duster, proceeded dust table. But wood-ashes flew so, seemed useless attempt getting rid them, she sat think done. But little indeed done do. Her first thought run away sun high, get forest night came on. She fancied she could easily go back way she come, get home her father’s palace. But experienced traveller world ever go back way wise woman brought him. She got went door. It locked! What could old woman meant telling her leave cottage? She indignant. The wise woman meant make difficult, impossible. Before princess, however, could find way out, she heard hand door, darted terror behind it. The wise woman opened it, and, leaving open, walked straight hearth. Rosamond immediately slid out, ran little way, laid herself long heather. V. The wise woman walked straight hearth, looked fire, looked bed, glanced round room, went table. When she saw one streak thick dust princess left there, smile, half sad, half pleased, like sun peeping cloud rainy day spring, gleamed her face. She went door, called loud voice, “Rosamond, come me.” All wolves hyenas, fast asleep wood, heard her voice, shivered dreams. No wonder princess trembled, found herself compelled, she could understand how, obey summons. She rose, like guilty thing she felt, forsook herself hiding-place she chosen, walked slowly back cottage she left full signs her shame. When she entered, she saw wise woman her knees, building fire fir-cones. Already flame climbing heap directions, crackling gently, sending sweet aromatic odor dusty cottage. “That part work,” she said, rising. “Now yours. But first let remind put off, would found far easier, quite pleasant work, much pleasant imagine now; would found time go wearily: would neither slept day let fire out, waked night heard howling beast-birds. More all, would glad see I came back; would leaped arms instead standing there, looking ugly foolish.” As she spoke, suddenly she held princess tiny mirror, clear nobody looking could tell made of, even see all—only thing reflected it. Rosamond saw child dirty fat cheeks, greedy mouth, cowardly eyes—which, daring look forward, seemed trying hide behind impertinent nose—stooping shoulders, tangled hair, tattered clothes, smears stains everywhere. That she made herself. And tell truth, she shocked sight, immediately began, her dirty heart, lay blame wise woman, she taken her away her nurses her fine clothes; time she knew well enough that, close heather-bed, loveliest little well, big enough wash in, water always springing fresh ground, running away wall. Beside lay whitest linen towels, comb made mother-of-pearl, brush fir-needles, one she far lazy use. She dashed glass wise woman’s hand, lay, broken thousand pieces! Without word, wise woman stooped, gathered fragments—did leave searching she gathered last atom, she laid carefully, one one, fire, blazing high hearth. Then she stood looked princess, watching her sulkily. “Rosamond,” she said, countenance awful sternness, “until cleansed room—” “She calls room!” sneered princess herself. “You shall morsel eat. You may drink well, nothing else shall have. When work I set done, find food place before. I going home again; I warn leave house.” “She calls house!—It is good thing she is going anyhow!” said princess, turning her back mere rudeness, she one who, even she liked thing before, would dislike moment person authority her desired her it. When she looked again, wise woman vanished. Thereupon princess ran door, tried open it; open would not. She searched sides, could discover way getting out. The windows would open—at least she could open them; outlet seemed chimney, she afraid try fire, looked angry, she thought, shot green flames she went near it. So she sat consider. One may well wonder room consideration was—with her work lying undone behind her. She sat thus, however, considering, she called it, hunger began sting her, she jumped put her hand usual hole wall: nothing there. She fell straight one her stupid rages; neither her hunger hole wall heeded her rage. Then, burst self-pity, she fell a-weeping, neither hunger hole cared her tears. The darkness began come on, her hunger grew grew, terror wild noises last night invaded her. Then she began feel cold, saw fire dying. She darted heap cones, fed it. It blazed cheerily, she comforted little. Then she thought herself would surely better give far, little work, die hunger. So catching duster, she began upon table. The dust flew nearly choked her. She ran well drink, refreshed encouraged. Perceiving tedious plan wipe dust table floor, whence would swept again, she got wooden platter, wiped dust that, carried fire, threw in. But time she getting hungry and, although she tried hole again, become certain work she must she would eat. At length furniture dusted, she began sweep floor, happily, she thought sprinkling water, window she seen marble court palace. That swept, she rushed hole—but still food! She verge another rage, thought came she might forgotten something. To her dismay she found table chairs every thing covered dust—not badly before, however. Again she set work, driven hunger, drawn hope eating, yet again, second careful wiping, sought hole. But no! nothing her! What could mean? Her asking question sign progress: showed she expected wise woman keep her word. Then she bethought her she forgotten household utensils, dishes plates, wanted washed well dusted. Faint hunger, she set work yet again. One thing made her think another, length she cleaned every thing she could think of. Now surely she must find food hole! When time also nothing, she began abuse wise woman false treacherous;—but ah! bed unwatered! That soon amended.—Still supper! Ah! hearth unswept, fire wanted making up!—Still supper! What else could be? She her wits’ end, weariness, laziness time, sat gazed fire. There, she gazed, she spied something brilliant,—shining even, midst fire: little mirror whole again; little she knew dust she thrown fire helped heal it. She drew carefully, and, looking it, saw, indeed ugly creature she seen before, still dirty little animal; whereupon she hurried well, took her clothes, plunged it, washed herself clean. Then she brushed combed her hair, made her clothes tidy might be, ran hole wall: huge basin bread milk! Never she eaten thing half relish! Alas! however, she finished, she wash basin, left was, revealing entirely rest done hunger. Then she threw herself heather, fast asleep moment. Never evil bird came near her night, she much one troubled dream. In morning she lay awake getting up, she spied seemed door behind tall eight-day clock stood silent corner. “Ah!” she thought, “that must way out!” got instantly. The first thing she did, however, go hole wall. Nothing there. “Well, I hardly used!” she cried aloud. “All cleaning cross old woman yesterday, trouble,—nothing breakfast! Not even crust bread! Does Mistress Ogress fancy princess bear that?” The poor foolish creature seemed think work one day ought serve next day too! But nowhere way whole universe. How could universe case? And even she never dreamed applying rule her breakfast. “How good I yesterday!” she said, “and hungry ill used I to-day!” But she would _not_ slave, to-day she done last night! _She_ did not care her breakfast! She might doubt she dusted wretched place again, she going that—at least, without seeing first lay behind clock! Off she darted, putting her hand behind clock found latch door. It lifted, door opened little way. By squeezing hard, she managed get behind clock, door. But she stared, instead open heath, she found herself marble floor large stately room, lighted above. Its walls strengthened pilasters, every space large picture, cornice floor. She know make it. Surely she run round cottage, certainly seen nothing size near it! She forgot she also run round she took hay-mow, peat-stack, several things looked consequence moonlight. “So, then,” she cried, “the old woman _is_ cheat! I believe she is ogress, all, lives palace—though she pretends it is cottage, keep people suspecting she eats good little children like me!” Had princess tolerably tractable, she would, time, known good deal wise woman’s beautiful house, whereas she never till got farther porch. Neither she innermost places now. But, king’s daughter she was, she little daunted when, stepping forward recess door, she saw great lordly hall was. She dared hardly look end, seemed far off: she began gaze things near her, pictures first all, she great liking pictures. One particular attracted her attention. She came back several times, length stood absorbed it. A blue summer sky, white fleecy clouds floating beneath it, hung hill green top, alive streams darting sides toward valley below. On face hill strayed flock sheep feeding, attended shepherd two dogs. A little way apart, girl stood bare feet brook, building across bridge rough stones. The wind blowing her hair back her rosy face. A lamb feeding close beside her; sheepdog trying reach her hand lick it. “Oh, I wish I little girl!” said princess aloud. “I wonder people made much happier others! If I little girl, one would ever call naughty.” She gazed gazed picture. At length she said herself, “I believe picture. It real country, real hill, real little girl upon it. I shall soon see whether is not another old witch’s cheats!” She went close picture, lifted her foot, stepped frame. “I free, I free!” she exclaimed; she felt wind upon her cheek. The sound closing door struck her ear. She turned—and blank wall, without door window, behind her. The hill sheep her, she set reach it. Now, I asked could be, I answer, result interaction things outside things inside, wise woman’s skill, silly child’s folly. If satisfy questioner, I add, wise woman able far wonderful things this. VI. Meantime wise woman busy she always was; her business child shepherd shepherdess, away north. Her name Agnes. Her father mother poor, could give her many things. Rosamond would utterly despised rude, simple playthings she had. Yet one respect value far hers: king bought Rosamond’s his money; Agnes’s father made his hands. And Agnes things—not seeing many things her, even knowing many things anywhere, she wish many things, therefore neither covetous avaricious. She played toys her father made her, thought wonderful things world—windmills, little crooks, water-wheels, sometimes lambs made wool, dolls made leg-bones sheep, her mother dressed her; playthings she never tired. Sometimes, however, she preferred playing stones, plentiful, flowers, few, brooks ran hill, which, although many, she could play one time, that, indeed, troubled her little—or live lambs wool, sheep-dogs, friendly her, best playfellows, she thought, she human ones compare with. Neither she greedy nice things, content, well she might be, homely food provided her. Nor she nature particularly self-willed disobedient; she generally her father mother wished, believed told her. But degrees spoiled her; way: proud her always repeated every thing she said, told every thing she did, even she present; full admiration child they, wondered laughed praised things her another child would never struck least remarkable, things even would another disgusted altogether. Impertinent rude things done _their_ child thought _so_ clever! laughing something quite marvellous; her commonplace speeches said finest poetry; pretty ways every moderately good child extolled result her excellent taste, choice her judgment will. They would even say sometimes she ought hear her praises fear make her vain, whisper behind hands, loud she could fail hear every word. The consequence she soon came believe—so soon, she could recall time she believe, absolute fact universe, she _Somebody;_ is, she became immoderately conceited. Now least atom conceit thing ashamed of, may fancy she like quantity inside her! At first show outside active form; wise woman cottage, seen her sitting alone, smile self-satisfaction upon her face would quite startling her, she ever startled thing; smile she could see lying root worm made it. For smiles like ruddiness certain apples, owing centipede, creeping thing, coiled heart them. Only her worm face shape image her own; she looked simpering, mawkish, self-conscious, silly, she made wise woman feel rather sick. Not child fool. Had she been, wise woman would pitied loved her, instead feeling sick she looked her. She fair abilities, she made humble, would capable good deal time, beginning grow end. But, she made humble, her growing would mass distorted shapes huddled together; that, although body she showed might grow straight well-shaped comely behold, new body growing inside it, would come she died, would ugly, crooked way that, like aged hawthorn lived hundreds years exposed upon sides salt sea-winds. As time went on, disease self-conceit went too, gradually devouring good her. For fault bring brothers sisters cousins live it. By degrees, thinking herself clever, she came fancy whatever seemed her, must course correct judgment, whatever she wished, right thing; grew obstinate, length her parents feared thwart her thing, knowing well she would never give in. But victories far worse defeats; overcome angel gentle put his strength, ride away triumph back devil, one poorest. So long she left take her way she would, she gave her parents little trouble. She would play herself little garden hardy flowers, amongst heather bees busy; she would wander away amongst hills, nobody knew where, sometimes morning night; her parents venture find fault her. She never went rages like princess, would thought Rosamond—oh, ugly vile! she seen her one her passions. But she better, that, quite ugly eyes wise woman, could see read her face. What choose face distorted hideousness anger, one distorted silliness self-complacency? True, hope helping angry child her form selfishness conceited child hers; hand, conceited child terrible dangerous wrathful one. The conceited one, however, sometimes angry, her anger spiteful other’s; and, again, wrathful one often conceited too. So that, whole, two unpleasant creatures, I would say king’s daughter would worse, shepherd’s quite bad. But, I said, wise woman her eye upon her: she saw something special must done, else she would one kneel shadows till feet grow knees; go hands till hands grow feet; lay faces ground till grow snouts; last hideous sort lizards, believes best, wisest, loveliest world, yea, centre universe. And run forever looking shadows, may worship them, miserable cannot find them, near ground shadows; becomes last one knows. The wise woman, therefore, one day walked door shepherd’s cottage, dressed like poor woman, asked drink water. The shepherd’s wife looked her, liked her, brought her cup milk. The wise woman took it, she made rule accept every kindness offered her. Agnes nature greedy girl, I said; self-conceit go far generate every vice sun. Vanity, form self-conceit, repeatedly shown deepest feeling heart horrible murderess. That morning, breakfast, her mother stinted her milk—just little—that she might enough make milk-porridge dinner. Agnes mind time, she saw milk given beggar, she called wise woman—though, surely, one might ask draught water, accept draught milk, without beggar sense Agnes’s contemptuous use word implied—a cloud came upon her forehead, double vertical wrinkle settled her nose. The wise woman saw it, her business Agnes though she little knew it, and, rising, went offered cup child, she sat her knitting corner. Agnes looked it, want it, inclined refuse beggar, thinking would show her consequence assert her rights, took drank up. For whoever possessed devil, judges mind devil; hence Agnes guilty meanness many capable something bad consider incredible. The wise woman waited till she finished it—then, looking empty cup, said: “You might given back much claim upon!” Agnes turned away made answer—far less shame indignation. The wise woman looked mother. “You offered her mean her it,” said mother, siding devil her child wise woman her child too. Some foolish people think take another’s part take part he takes. The wise woman said nothing, fixed her eyes upon her, soon mother hid her face her apron weeping. Then she turned Agnes, never looked round sat her back both, suddenly lapped her folds her cloak. When mother lifted her eyes, she vanished. Never supposing she carried away her child, uncomfortable she said poor woman, mother went door, called her she toiled slowly hill. But she never turned her head; mother went back her cottage. The wise woman walked close past shepherd his dogs, midst his flock sheep. The shepherd wondered she could going—right hill. There something strange her too, he thought; he followed her his eyes she went up. It near sunset, sun went down, gray cloud settled top mountain, his last rays turned rosy gold. Straight cloud shepherd saw woman hold her pace, she vanished. He little imagined his child her cloak. He went home usual evening, Agnes come in. They accustomed absence then, first frightened; grew dark she appear, husband set his dogs one direction, wife another, seek child. Morning came found her. Then whole country-side arose search missing Agnes; day day night night passed, nothing discovered concerning her, length gave search despair except mother, although she nearly convinced poor woman carried her off. One day she wandered distance her cottage, thinking she might come upon remains her daughter foot cliff, she came suddenly, instead, upon disconsolate-looking creature sitting stone side stream. Her hair hung tangles her head; her clothes tattered, rents her skin showed many places; her cheeks white, worn thin hunger; hollows dark her eyes, stood scared wild. When she caught sight shepherdess, she jumped her feet, would run away, fell faint. At first sight mother taken her her child, she saw, pang disappointment, she mistaken. Full compassion, nevertheless, she said herself: “If she Agnes, she much need help she were. If I cannot good own, I good I woman’s; though I scorn consoled loss one presence another, I yet may find gladness rescuing one child death taken other.” Perhaps her words like these, her thoughts were. She took child, carried her home. And Rosamond came occupy place little girl she envied picture. VII. Notwithstanding differences two girls, were, indeed, many people would said least alike, this, cared her fancies desires thing else world. But I tell another difference: princess like several children one—such variety her moods; one mood she recollection care thing whatever belonging previous mood—not even left her moment before, violent make her ready put her hand fire get she wanted. Plainly she mere puppet her moods, that, cunning nurse knew her well enough could call send away moods almost she pleased, like showman pulling strings behind show. Agnes, contrary, seldom changed her mood, kept calm assured self-satisfaction. Father mother ever wise punishment helped her gain victory herself, she like choose; folly reasoning one unreasonable fixed her her conceit. She would actually nod her head herself complacent pride she stood them. This, however, difficult justify even pride conquered, seeing she loved little, paid little attention arguments persuasions used. Neither, she found herself wrapped dark folds wise woman’s cloak, she behave least like princess, she afraid. “She will soon set down,” she said, self-important suppose one would dare her injury. Whether good thing bad afraid depends fearlessness founded upon. Some fear, knowledge danger: nothing fine that. Some stupid afraid: nothing fine that. Some easily frightened would yet turn backs run, moment frightened: never courage fear. But man his work spite his fear man true courage. The fearlessness Agnes ignorance: she know hurt; she never read single story giant, ogress wolf; her mother never carried one her threats punishment. If wise woman pinched her, she would shown herself abject little coward, trembling fear every change motion long she carried her. Nothing such, however, wise woman’s plan curing her. On she carried her without word. She knew she set her she would never run her like princess, least evil thing already upon her. On she went, never halting, never letting light look in, Agnes look out. She walked fast, got home her cottage soon princess gone it. But she set Agnes either cottage great hall. She places, none alike. The place she chosen Agnes strange one—such one found nowhere else wide world. It great hollow sphere, made substance similar mirror Rosamond broken, differently compounded. That substance one could see itself. It neither door, window, opening break perfect roundness. The wise woman carried Agnes dark room, undressed her, took her hand her knitting-needles, put her, naked she born, hollow sphere. What sort place she could tell. She could see nothing faint cold bluish light her. She could feel thing supported her, yet she sink. She stood while, perfectly calm, sat down. Nothing bad could happen _her_—she important! And, indeed, this: she cared Somebody, she going Somebody. Her choice going carried good deal farther her she would knowingly carried herself. After sitting while, she wished she something do, nothing came. A little longer, grew wearisome. She would see whether she could walk strange luminous dusk surrounded her. Walk she found she could, well enough, walk she could not. On she went, keeping much straight line she might, walking she thoroughly tired, she found herself nearer her prison before. She not, indeed, advanced single step; for, whatever direction she tried go, sphere turned round round, answering her feet accordingly. Like squirrel his cage she kept placing another spot cunningly suspended sphere her feet, she would still lowest point walking ages. At length she cried aloud; answer. It grew dreary drearier—in her, is: outside change. Nothing overhead, nothing foot, nothing either hand, pale, faint, bluish glimmer. She wept last, grew angry, sullen; nobody heeded whether she cried laughed. It cold unmoving twilight rounded her. On went dreary hours—or go all?—“no change, pause, hope;”—on till she _felt_ she forgotten, she grew strangely still fell asleep. The moment she asleep, wise woman came, lifted her out, laid her her bosom; fed her wonderful milk, she received without knowing it; nursed her night long, and, ere she woke, laid her back blue sphere again. When first she came herself, she thought horrors preceding day dream night. But soon asserted facts, were!—nothing see cold blue light, nothing see it. Oh, slowly hours went by! She lost notion time. If she told she twenty years, she would believed it—or twenty minutes—it would same: except weariness, time her more. Another night came, another still, wise woman nursed fed her. But she knew nothing that, one dreary day seemed ever brooding her. All once, third day, she aware naked child seated beside her. But something child made her shudder. She never looked Agnes, sat her chin sunk her chest, her eyes staring her toes. She color pale earth, pinched nose, mere slit her face mouth. “How ugly she is!” thought Agnes. “What business she beside me!” But lonely she would glad play serpent, put her hand touch her. She touched nothing. The child, also, put her hand—but direction away Agnes. And well, she touched Agnes would killed her. Then Agnes said, “Who you?” And little girl said, “Who you?” “I Agnes,” said Agnes; little girl said, “I Agnes.” Then Agnes thought she mocking her, said, “You ugly;” little girl said, “You ugly.” Then Agnes lost her temper, put her hands seize little girl; lo! little girl gone, she found herself tugging her hair. She let go; little girl again! Agnes furious now, flew her bite her. But she found her teeth her arm, little girl gone—only return again; time she came back she tenfold uglier before. And Agnes hated her her whole heart. The moment she hated her, flashed upon her sickening disgust child another, her Self, her Somebody, she shut her ever ever—no one moment ever alone. In her agony despair, sleep descended, she slept. When she woke, little girl, heedless, ugly, miserable, staring her toes. All once, creature began smile, odious, self-satisfied expression, Agnes felt ashamed seeing her. Then she began pat her cheeks, stroke her body, examine her finger-ends, nodding her head satisfaction. Agnes felt could another hateful, ape-like creature, time perfectly aware she outside her she herself doing, long she could remember, inside her. She turned sick herself, would gladly put existence, three days odious companionship went on. By third day, Agnes merely sick ashamed life she hitherto led, despicable her eyes, astonished she never seen truth concerning herself before. The next morning she woke arms wise woman; horror vanished her sight, two heavenly eyes gazing upon her. She wept clung her, she clung, tenderly great strong arms close around her. When she lain thus while, wise woman carried her her cottage, washed her little well; dressed her clean garments, gave her bread milk. When she eaten it, she called her her, said solemnly,— “Agnes, must imagine cured. That ashamed sign shame ceased. In new circumstances, especially done well while, danger thinking much before. So beware yourself. I going home, leave charge house. Do I tell till return.” She gave her directions she formerly given Rosamond—with difference, she told her go picture-hall she pleased, showing her entrance, clock longer stood—and went away, closing door behind her. VIII. As soon she left alone, Agnes set work tidying dusting cottage, made fire, watered bed, cleaned inside windows: wise woman herself always kept outside clean. When she done, she found her dinner—of sort she used home, better—in hole wall. When she eaten it, she went look pictures. By time her old disposition begun rouse again. She her duty, consequence begun think herself Somebody. However strange may well seem, one’s duty make one conceited sometimes. Those always would soon think conceited eating dinner duty. What honest boy would pride picking pockets? A thief trying reform would. To conceited one’s duty sign little one it, little one sees contemptible thing it. Could low creature conceited contemptible? Until duty becomes us common breathing, poor creatures. So Agnes began stroke herself more, forgetting her late self-stroking companion, never reflecting she she abhorred. And mood she went picture-gallery. The first picture she saw represented square great city, one side occupied splendid marble palace, great flights broad steps leading door. Between square marble-paved court, gates brass, stood sentries gorgeous uniforms, affixed following proclamation letters gold, large enough Agnes read:— “By King, time notice, every stray child found realm shall brought without moment’s delay palace. Whoever shall found done otherwise shall straightway lose his head hand public executioner.” Agnes’s heart beat loud, her face flushed. “Can city world?” she said herself. “If I knew was, I set once. _There_ would place clever girl like me!” Her eyes fell picture enticed Rosamond. It country her father fed his flocks. Just round shoulder hill cottage her parents lived, she born whence she carried beggar-woman. “Ah!” she said, “they did not know there. They little thought I could be, I chance. If I good, kind, loving, generous king’s palace, I soon great lady never saw! Then would understand good little girl I always been! And I should not forget poor parents like I read of. _I_ would generous. _I_ never selfish proud like girls story-books!” As she said this, she turned her back disdain upon picture her home, setting herself picture palace, stared wide ambitious eyes, heart whose every beat throb arrogant self-esteem. The shepherd-child worse ever poor princess been. For wise woman given her terrible lesson one princess capable, she known meant; yet she bad ever, therefore worse before. The ugly creature whose presence made her miserable indeed crept sight mind too—but she? Nestling her heart, she her company, least could see her. The wise woman called her out, Agnes might see sort creature she herself; she snug her soul’s bed again, she even suspect she there. After gazing palace picture, her ambitious pride rose rose, she turned yet condescending mood, honored home picture one stare more. “What poor, miserable spot compared lordly palace!” she said. But presently she spied something she seen before, drew nearer. It form little girl, building bridge stones one hill-brooks. “Ah, I myself!” she said. “That I used do.—No,” she resumed, “it me. That snub-nosed little fright could never meant me! It frock made think so. But _is_ picture place. I declare, I see smoke cottage rising behind hill! What dull, dirty, insignificant spot is! And life lead there!” She turned city picture. And strange thing took place. In proportion other, eyes her mind, receded background, this, her present bodily eyes, appeared come forward assume reality. At last, way growing upon her time, she gave cry conviction, said aloud,— “I believe real! That frame trick woman make fancy picture lest I go make fortune. She witch, ugly old creature! It would serve her right tell king her punished taking palace—one his poor lost children he fond of! I like see her ugly old head cut off. Anyhow I try luck without asking her leave. How she ill used me!” But moment, she heard voice wise woman calling, “Agnes!” and, smoothing her face, she tried look good she could, walked back cottage. There stood wise woman, looking round place, examining her work. She fixed her eyes upon Agnes way confused her, made her cast down, she felt she reading her thoughts. The wise woman, however, asked questions, began talk her work, approving it, filled her arrogance, showing might done better, filled her resentment. But wise woman seemed take care she might thinking, went straight her lesson. By time over, power reading thoughts would necessary knowledge mind Agnes, come surface—that her face, surface mind. Ere time sink again, wise woman caught little mirror, held her: Agnes saw her Somebody—the embodiment miserable conceit ugly ill-temper. She gave scream horror wise woman pitied her, laying aside mirror, took her upon her knees, talked her kindly solemnly; particular necessity destroying ugly things come heart—so ugly make face ugly also. And Agnes time wise woman talking her? Would believe it?—instead thinking kill ugly things her heart, she her might resolving careful her face, is, keep things her heart show her face, she resolving hypocrite well self-worshipper. Her heart wormy, worms eating fast now. Then wise woman laid her gently upon heather-bed, she fell fast asleep, awful dream her Somebody. When she woke morning, instead getting work house, she lay thinking—to evil purpose. In place taking her dream warning, thinking wise woman said night before, she communed herself fashion:— “If I stay longer, I shall miserable, It nothing better slavery. The old witch shows horrible things day set dreaming horrible things night. If I do not run away, frightful blue prison disgusting girl come back, I shall go mind. How I wish I could find way good king’s palace! I shall go look picture again—if picture—as soon I have got clothes on. The work wait. It is work. It is old witch’s; she ought herself.” She jumped bed, hurried her clothes. There wise woman seen; she hastened hall. There picture, marble palace, proclamation shining letters gold upon gates brass. She stood it, gazed gazed; time kept growing upon her strange way, last she fully persuaded picture, real city, square, marble palace, seen framed opening wall. She ran frame, stepped it, felt wind blow upon her cheek, heard sound closing door behind her, free. _Free_ she, creature inside her? The moment terrible storm thunder lightning, wind rain, came on. The uproar appalling. Agnes threw herself upon ground, hid her face her hands, lay over. As soon she felt sun shining her, she rose. There city far away horizon. Without turning take farewell look place she leaving, she set off, fast her feet would carry her, direction city. So eager she, she fell, get up, run faster before. IX. The shepherdess carried Rosamond home, gave her warm bath tub she washed her linen, made her bread-and-milk, she eaten it, put her bed Agnes’s crib, she slept rest day following night. When last she opened her eyes, see around her far poorer cottage one she left—very bare uncomfortable indeed, she might well thought; she come troubles late, way hunger weariness cold fear, she altogether her ordinary mood fault-finding, able lie enjoying thought length she safe, going fed kept warm. The idea thing return shelter food clothes, not, however, even cross her mind. But shepherdess one plentiful number wiser concerning women’s children concerning own. Such often give tolerable hints ought manage children, find fault neatly enough system trying carry out; wisdom goes talking, none left said. There one road talk never finds, way talker’s hands feet. And never seem know themselves—not even reading print. Still, specially blinded direction own, sometimes even act little sense towards children theirs. They affected sort blindness like renders people incapable seeing, except sideways. She came bed, looked princess, saw she better. But she like her much. There mark princess her, never since she began run alone. True, hunger brought her fat cheeks, turned her impudent nose, driven sullenness greed her mouth. Nothing wise woman could that—and even she, without aid princess herself. So shepherdess thought poor substitute she got her lovely Agnes—who fact equally repulsive, way she got used; selfishness her love blinded her thin pinched nose mean self-satisfied mouth. It well princess, though, sad say, shepherdess take her, she would likely done her harm instead good. “Now, girl,” she said, “you must get up, something. We cannot keep idle folk here.” “I am folk,” said Rosamond; “I am princess.” “A pretty princess—with nose like that! And rags too! If tell stories, I shall soon let know I think you.” Rosamond understood mere calling herself princess, without thing show it, use. She obeyed rose, she hungry; she sweep floor ere she thing eat. The shepherd came breakfast, kinder his wife. He took her his arms would kissed her; she took insult man whose hands smelt tar, kicked screamed rage. The poor man, finding he made mistake, set her once. But look two, one might well judged condescension rather rudeness man kiss child. He tall, almost stately, thoughtful forehead, bright eyes, eagle nose, gentle mouth; princess I described her. Not content set let alone, she continued storm scold shepherd, crying she princess, would like know right he touch her! But he looked upon her height his tall person benignant smile, regarding her spoiled little ape whose mother flattered her calling her princess. “Turn her doors, ungrateful hussy!” cried his wife. “With bread milk inside her ugly body, she gives it! Troth, I am paid carrying home ill-bred tramp arms! My poor angel Agnes! As ill-tempered toad one hair like her!” These words drove princess beside herself; given abuse least endure it. With fists feet teeth, her will not, she rushed shepherdess, whose hand already raised deal her sound box ear, better appointed minister vengeance suddenly showed himself. Bounding cottage-door came one sheep-dogs, called Prince, I shall refer _which_, he superior animal indeed, even sheep-dog, intelligent dogs: he flew princess, knocked her down, commenced shaking her violently tear her miserable clothes pieces. Used, however, mouthing little lambs, he took care hurt her much, though her good he left her blue nip two way letting her imagine biting might be. His master, knowing he would injure her, thought better call off, half minute he left her his accord, and, casting glance indignant rebuke behind he went, walked slowly hearth, he laid his tail toward her. She rose, terrified almost death, would crept Agnes’s crib refuge; shepherdess cried— “Come, come, princess! I will skulking bed good daylight. Go clean master’s Sunday boots there.” “I not!” screamed princess, ran house. “Prince!” cried shepherdess, jumped dog, looked her face, wagging his bushy tail. “Fetch her back,” she said, pointing door. With two three bounds Prince caught princess, threw her down, taking her her clothes dragged her back cottage, dropped her his mistress’ feet, she lay like bundle rags. “Get up,” said shepherdess. Rosamond got pale death. “Go clean boots.” “I do not know how.” “Go try. There brushes, yonder blacking-pot.” Instructing her black boots, came thought shepherdess fine thing would she could teach miserable little wretch, forsaken ill-bred, good, well-behaved, respectable child. She hardly woman it, every thing well meant help, she wisdom beg her husband place Prince her orders while, take hill usual, he might help her getting princess order. When husband gone, his boots, aid her finishing touches, last quite respectably brushed, shepherdess told princess she might go play while, she must go sight cottage-door. The princess went right gladly, firm intention, however, getting sight slow degrees, taking her heels. But sooner she threshold shepherdess said dog, “Watch her;” shot Prince. The moment she saw him, Rosamond threw herself her face, trembling head foot. But dog quarrel her, violence he always felt bound protest dog fashion, sign prostrate shape him; he poked his nose her, turned her over, began licking her face hands. When she saw he meant friendly, her love animals, indulgence long time now, came wide awake, little romping rushing about, best friends world. Having thus seen one enemy, she thought, changed friend, she began resume her former plan, crept cunningly farther farther. At length she came little hollow, instantly rolled it. Finding she sight cottage, she ran full speed. But she gone dozen paces, she heard growling rush behind her, next instant ground, dog standing her, showing his teeth, flaming her his eyes. She threw her arms round his neck, immediately he licked her face, let her get up. But moment she would moved step farther cottage, he front her, growling, showing his teeth. She saw use, went back him. Thus princess provided dog private tutor—just right sort her. Presently shepherdess appeared door called her. She would disregarded summons, Prince his best let her know that, she could obey herself, she must obey him. So she went cottage, shepherdess ordered her peel potatoes dinner. She sulked refused. Here Prince could nothing help his mistress, she go far find another ally. “Very well, Miss Princess!” she said; “we shall soon see like go without dinner-time comes.” Now princess little foresight, idea future hunger would moved her little; happily, her game romps Prince, she begun hungry already, threat force. She took knife began peel potatoes. By slow degrees princess improved little. A outbreaks passion, savage attacks Prince, she learned try restrain herself she felt passion coming on; dinnerless afternoons entirely opened her eyes necessity working order eat. Prince her first, Hunger her second dog-counsellor. But still better thing she soon grew fond Prince. Towards gaining her affections, he three advantages: first, his nature inferior hers; next, he beast; last, she afraid him; spoiled she she could easily love her, beast, one her kind, indeed could hardly ever come love thing much she first learned fear, white teeth flaming eyes angry Prince terrible her thing yet been, except wolf, she forgotten. Then again, he delightful playfellow, long she neither lost her temper, went orders, she might almost thing she pleased him. In fact, his influence upon her, she scoffed wisest woman whole world, derided wishes her father mother, came length regard dog superior being, look well love him. And best all. The improvement upon her, course month, plain. She quite ceased go passions, actually begun take little interest her work try well. Still, change mostly outside one. I mean she pretending. Indeed she never given pretence sort. But change _her_, her mood. A second change circumstances would soon brought second change behavior; and, long possible, she continued sort person she always been. But she gained much, trifle gained her: little quietness order mind, hence somewhat greater possibility first idea right arising it, whereupon she would begin see wretched creature she was, must continue she herself right. Meantime wise woman watching her she least fancied it, taking note change passing upon her. Out large eyes gentle sheep she watching her—a sheep puzzled shepherd; every she would appear his flock, he would catch sight her two three times day, sometimes days together, yet he never saw her he looked her, never he counted flock fold night. He knew she one his; could she come from, could she go to? For flock within many miles, he never could get near enough her see whether she marked. Nor Prince least use unravelling mystery; although, often he told fetch strange sheep, he went bounding her once, lie her feet. At length, however, wise woman made her mind, strange sheep longer troubled shepherd. As Rosamond improved, shepherdess grew kinder. She gave her Agnes’s clothes, began treat her much like daughter. Hence she great deal liberty little work required her over, would often spend hours time shepherd, watching sheep dogs, learning little seeing Prince, others well, managed charge—how never touched sheep told turned bid, jumped disobedient flock, ran along backs, biting, barking, half choking mouthfuls wool. Then also she would play brooks, learn songs, build bridges them. And sometimes she would seized delight heart she would spread her arms wind, go rushing hill till her breath left her, she would tumble heather, lie till came back again. A noticeable change time passed also her countenance. Her coarse shapeless mouth begun show glimmer lines curves it, fat returned roses her cheeks, her eyes looked larger before; while, noteworthy still, bridge her nose grown higher, less impudent, insignificant thing inherited certain great-great-great-grandmother, little else leave her. For long time, fitted her well, like her; ground alteration, already granny gave her would recognized it. It growing little liker Prince’s; Prince’s long, perceptive, sagacious nose,—one seldom mistaken. One day noon, sheep mostly lying down, shepherd, left care dogs, stretched shade rock little way apart, princess sat knitting, Prince her feet, lying wait snap great fly, even he his follies—Rosamond saw poor woman come toiling hill, took little notice her she passing, yards off, she heard her utter dog’s name low voice. Immediately summons, Prince started followed her—with hanging head, gently-wagging tail. At first princess thought he merely taking observations, consulting his nose whether she respectable not, she soon saw he following her meek submission. Then she sprung her feet cried, “Prince, Prince!” But Prince turned his head gave her odd look, he trying smile, could not. Then princess grew angry, ran him, shouting, “Prince, come directly.” Again Prince turned his head, time growl show his teeth. The princess flew one her forgotten rages, picking stone, flung woman. Prince turned darted her, fury his eyes, his white teeth gleaming. At awful sight princess turned also, would fled, he upon her moment, threw her ground, she lay. It evening she came herself. A cool twilight wind, somehow seemed come way stars, blowing upon her. The poor woman Prince, shepherd his sheep, gone, she left alone wind upon heather. She felt sad, weak, and, perhaps, first time her life, little ashamed. The violence she guilty vanished her spirit, lay her memory calm morning behind it, front quiet dusky night closing loud shame betwixt double peace. Between two her passion looked ugly. It pained her remember. She felt hateful, _hers_. But, alas, Prince gone! That horrid woman taken away! The fury rose her heart, raged—until came her mind her dear Prince would flown her throat he seen her passion. The memory calmed her, she rose went home. There, perhaps, she would find Prince, surely he could never silly dog go away altogether strange woman! She opened door went in. Dogs asleep cottage, seemed her, nowhere Prince. She crept away her little bed, cried herself asleep. In morning shepherd shepherdess indeed glad find she come home, thought she run away. “Where Prince?” she cried, moment she waked. “His mistress taken him,” answered shepherd. “Was woman his mistress?” “I fancy so. He followed her he known her his life. I sorry lose him, though.” The poor woman gone close past rock shepherd lay. He saw her coming, thought strange sheep feeding beside he lay down. “Who she be?” he said himself; he noted Prince followed her, without even looking he passed, he remembered Prince come him. And how: he lay bed one fierce winter morning, rise, he heard voice woman call storm, “Shepherd, I brought dog. Be good him. I come fetch away.” He dressed quickly he could, went door. It half snowed up, top white mound stood Prince. And he gone mysteriously he come, he felt sad. Rosamond sorry too, hence she saw looks shepherd shepherdess, she able understand them. And she tried behave better sorrow. So loss dog brought nearer other. X. After thunder-storm, Agnes meet single obstruction misadventure. Everybody strangely polite, gave her whatever she desired, answered her questions, asked none return, looked time her departure would relief. They afraid, fact, her appearance, lest she tell she lost, would bound, pain public execution, take her palace. But sooner she entered city she saw would hardly present herself lost child palace-gates; know she impostor, especially since she really one, run away wise woman? So she wandered looking every thing she tired, bewildered noise confusion around her. The wearier she got, she pushed every direction. Having used whole hill wander upon, she awkward crowded streets, often point run horses, seemed her going every way like frightened flock. She spoke several persons, one stopped answer her; length, her courage giving way, she felt lost indeed, began cry. A soldier saw her, asked matter. “I have nowhere go to,” she sobbed. “Where is mother?” asked soldier. “I do not know,” answered Agnes. “I carried old woman, went away left me. I do not know she is, I myself.” “Come,” said soldier, “this case his Majesty.” So saying, he took her hand, led her palace, begged audience king queen. The porter glanced Agnes, immediately admitted them, showed great splendid room, king queen sat every day review lost children, hope one day thus finding Rosamond. But time beginning get tired it. The moment cast eyes upon Agnes, queen threw back her head, threw her hands, cried, “What miserable, conceited, white-faced little ape!” king turned upon soldier wrath, cried, forgetting his decree, “What mean bringing dirty, vulgar-looking, pert creature palace? The dullest soldier army could never moment imagine child like _that_, one hair’s-breadth like lovely angel lost!” “I humbly beg Majesty’s pardon,” said soldier, “but I do? There stands Majesty’s proclamation gold letters brazen gates palace.” “I shall taken down,” said king. “Remove child.” “Please Majesty, I her?” “Take her home you.” “I six already, sire, want her.” “Then drop her picked her up.” “If I do, sire, one else find her bring her back Majesties.” “That never do,” said king. “I cannot bear look her.” “For her ugliness,” said queen, “she plainly lost, Rosamond.” “It may pretence, get palace,” said king. “Take her head scullion, soldier,” said queen, “and tell her make her useful. If she find she pretending lost, she must let know.” The soldier anxious get rid her, he caught her his arms, hurried her room, found his way scullery, gave her, trembling fear, charge head maid, queen’s message. As evident queen favor her, servants pleased her, often treated her harshly. Not one amongst liked her, wonder, seeing that, every step she took wise woman’s house, she grown contemptible, she grown conceited. Every civil answer given her, she attributed impression she made, desire get rid her; every kindness, approbation her looks speech, instead friendliness lonely child. Hence time she twice odious before; whoever severe treatment wise woman gave her, better it, always grows worse before. They drove her about, boxed her ears smallest provocation, laid every thing her charge, called her manner contemptuous names, jeered scoffed her awkwardnesses, made her life miserable she fair way forget every thing she learned, know nothing clean saucepans kettles. They would hard upon her, however, her irritating behavior. She dared refuse she told, she obeyed pursed-up mouth, contemptuous smile. The thing sustained her her constant contriving get painful position she found herself. There one true way, however, getting position may in, is, work well grow fit better: I need say plan upon Agnes cunning enough fix. She soon learned talk around her reason proclamation brought her hither. “Was lost princess beautiful?” she said one day youngest her fellow-servants. “Beautiful!” screamed maid; “she ugliest little toad ever set eyes upon.” “What she like?” asked Agnes. “She size, quite ugly, way; she red cheeks, cocked little nose, biggest, ugliest mouth ever saw.” Agnes fell a-thinking. “Is picture her anywhere palace?” she asked. “How I know? You ask housemaid.” Agnes soon learned one, contrived get peep it. Then she certain she suspected description given her, namely, she she seen picture wise woman’s house. The conclusion followed, lost princess must staying her father mother, assuredly picture she wore one her frocks. She went head scullion, humble manner, proud heart, begged her procure her favor word queen. “A likely thing indeed!” answer, accompanied resounding box ear. She tried head cook next, better success, driven her meditations again, result she began drop hints she knew something princess. This came length queen’s ears, she sent her. Absorbed her selfish ambitions, Agnes never thought risk she expose her parents, told queen her wanderings she caught sight lovely creature she described princess, dressed like peasant—saying, that, king would permit her go look her, she little doubt bringing her back safe sound within weeks. But although she spoke truth, she look cunning her pinched face, queen could possibly trust her, believed she made proposal merely get away, money given her her journey. Still chance, she would say thing she consulted king. Then Agnes lord chancellor, who, much questioning her, arrived last, he thought, notion part country described her—that was, she spoke truth, which, her looks behavior, he also considered entirely doubtful. Thereupon she ordered back kitchen, band soldiers, clever lawyer, sent search every foot supposed region. They commanded return brought them, bound hand foot, shepherd pair received full description. And Agnes worse before. For her miseries added fear would befall her discovered persons quest, she certain must find, her father mother. By time king queen tired seeing lost children, genuine pretended—for cared child longer seemed chance turning child—that new hope, which, however poor vague first, soon began grow upon imaginations had, commanded proclamation taken palace gates, directed various sentries admit child whatever, lost found, reason pretence might, orders. “I am sick children!” said king his secretary, he finished dictating direction. XI. After Prince gone, princess, degrees, fell back her bad old ways, presence dog, her betterment, kept her. She never grew nearly selfish again, she began let her angry old self lift head more, she grew bad shepherdess declared she stop house day longer, she quite unendurable. “It well you, husband,” she said, “for have not her day you, see best her. But her work instead play hours, would like her better I do. And it is her ugly passions only, she is one her tantrums, it is impossible get work her. At times she is obstinate as—as—as”— She going say “as Agnes,” feelings mother overcame her, she could utter words. “In fact,” she said instead, “she makes life miserable.” The shepherd felt he right tell his wife she must submit her life made miserable, therefore, although he really much attached Rosamond, he would interfere; shepherdess told her she must look another place. The princess was, however, much better before, even respect her passions, quite bad, one over, she really ashamed it. But once, ever since departure Prince she tried check rush evil temper came upon her. She hated she it, something; she it, she went full swing wherever prince power pleased carry her. Nor all: although she might time known well enough soon she she certain ashamed it, she would yet justify herself twenty different arguments looked good time, would looked poor indeed afterwards, she ever remembered them. She sorry leave shepherd’s cottage, she felt certain soon finding her way back her father mother; she would, indeed, set long before, her foot somehow got hurt Prince gave her his last admonition, she never since able long walks, she sometimes blamed her temper growing worse. But people good-tempered comfortable, thanks they?—Her foot much better; soon shepherdess thus spoken, she resolved set once, work beg her way home. At moment she quite unmindful she owed good people, and, indeed, yet incapable understanding tenth part her obligation them. So she bade good without tear, limped her way hill, leaving shepherdess weeping, shepherd looking grave. When she reached valley she followed course stream, knowing would lead her away hill sheep fed, richer lands farms cattle. Rounding one roots hill she saw her poor woman walking slowly along road burden heather upon her back, presently passed her, gone paces farther she heard her calling her kind old voice— “Your shoe-tie loose, child.” But Rosamond growing tired, her foot become painful, she cross, neither returned answer, paid heed warning. For cross, faults grow busy, poke ugly heads like maggots, princess’s old dislike thing came her least air advice returned full force. “My child,” said woman again, “if do not fasten shoe-tie, make fall.” “Mind business,” said Rosamond, without even turning her head, gone three steps she fell flat her face path. She tried get up, effort forced her scream, she sprained ankle foot already lame. The old woman her side instantly. “Where hurt, child?” she asked, throwing her burden kneeling beside her. “Go away,” screamed Rosamond. “_You_ made fall, bad woman!” The woman made reply, began feel her joints, soon discovered sprain. Then, spite Rosamond’s abuse, violent pushes even kicks she gave her, she took hurt ankle her hands, stroked pressed it, gently kneading it, were, her thumbs, coaxing every particle muscles right place. Nor she done long Rosamond lay still. At length she ceased, said:— “Now, child, may get up.” “I cannot get up, I am child,” cried Rosamond. “Go away.” Without another word woman left her, took her burden, continued her journey. In little Rosamond tried get up, succeeded, found she could walk, and, indeed, presently discovered her ankle foot also perfectly well. “I was not much hurt all,” she said herself, sent single grateful thought poor woman, she speedily passed upon road without even greeting. Late afternoon she came spot path divided two, taking one she liked look better, she started sound poor woman’s voice, she thought she left far behind, calling her. She looked round, she was, toiling her load heather before. “You taking wrong turn, child.” she cried. “How tell that?” said Rosamond. “You know nothing I want go.” “I know road take will not want go,” said woman. “I shall know I get there, then,” returned Rosamond, “and thanks you.” She set running. The woman took path, soon sight. By by, Rosamond found herself midst peat-moss—a flat, lonely, dismal, black country. She thought, however, road would soon lead her across side among farms, went without anxiety. But stream, hitherto her guide, vanished; began grow dark, Rosamond found she could longer distinguish track. She turned, therefore, find darkness covered behind well before. Still she made attempt go back keeping direct line she could, path straight arrow. But she could see enough even start her line, she gone far she found herself hemmed in, apparently every side, ditches pools black, dismal, slimy water. And dark she could see nothing gleam bit clear sky water. Again she stepped knee-deep black mud, tumbled shallow edge terrible pool; she gave attempt escape meshes watery net, stood still, began cry bitterly, despairingly. She saw her unreasonable anger made her foolish well rude, felt she justly punished her wickedness poor woman friendly her. What would Prince think her, he knew? She cast herself ground, hungry, cold, weary. Presently, she thought she saw long creatures come heaving black pools. A toad jumped upon her, she shrieked, sprang her feet, would run away headlong, she spied distance faint glimmer. She thought Will-of-the-wisp. What could he after? Was he looking her? She dared run, lest he see pounce upon her. The light came nearer, grew brighter larger. Plainly, little fiend looking her—he would torment her. After many twistings turnings among pools, came straight towards her, she would shrieked, terror made her dumb. It came nearer nearer, lo! borne dark figure, burden back: poor woman, demon, looking her! She gave scream joy, fell weeping her feet, clasped her knees. Then poor woman threw away her burden, laid her lantern, took princess her arms, folded her cloak around her, taken her lantern again, carried her slowly carefully midst black pools, winding hither thither. All night long she carried her thus, slowly wearily, length darkness grew little thinner, uncertain hint light came east, poor woman, stopping brow little hill, opened her cloak, set princess down. “I carry farther,” she said. “Sit grass till light comes. I stand you.” Rosamond asleep. Now she rubbed her eyes looked, dark see thing sky her head. Slowly light grew, she could see form poor woman standing front her; went growing, she began think she seen her somewhere before, till she thought wise woman, saw must she. Then she ashamed she bent her head, could look her longer. But poor woman spoke, voice wise woman, every word went deep heart princess. “Rosamond,” she said, “all time, ever since I carried father’s palace, I I could make lovely creature: ask far I succeeded.” All her past story, since she found herself first wise woman’s cloak, arose, glided past inner eyes princess, she saw, measure understood, all. But she sat her eyes ground, made sign. Then said wise woman:— “Below forest surrounds house. I going home. If pledge come me, I help you, way I could now, good lovely. I wait day, start once, may long noon. I shall breakfast waiting you. One thing more: beasts yet gone home holes; I give word, one touch long keep coming nearer house.” She ceased. Rosamond sat waiting hear something more; nothing came. She looked up; she alone. Alone more! Always left alone, she would yield right! Oh, safe she felt wise woman’s cloak! She indeed good her, she return behaved like one hyenas awful wood! What wonderful house she lived in! And her story came her brain her repentant heart. “Why did not she take her?” she said. “I would gone gladly.” And she wept. But her conscience told her that, middle her shame desire good, she returned answer words wise woman; she sat like tree-stump, done nothing. She tried say nothing done; she knew she could told wise woman she wicked, asked her take her her. Now nothing done. “Nothing done!” said her conscience. “Cannot rise, walk hill, wood?” “But wild beasts!” “There is! You do not believe wise woman yet! Did she tell beasts would touch you?” “But horrid!” “Yes, are; would far better eaten alive live on—such worthless creature are. Why, you are fit thought bad ugly creatures.” This herself talked her. XII. All she jumped her feet, ran full speed hill wood. She heard howlings yellings sides her, she ran straight on, near she could judge. Her spirits rose she ran. Suddenly she saw her, dusk thick wood, group dozen wolves hyenas, standing together right her way, green eyes fixed upon her staring. She faltered one step, bethought her wise woman promised, keeping straight on, dashed right middle them. They fled howling, she struck fire. She afraid that, ere sun she wood upon heath, bad thing could step upon live. With first peep sun horizon, she saw little cottage her, ran fast she could run towards it, When she came near it, she saw door open, ran straight outstretched arms wise woman. The wise woman kissed her stroked her hair, set her fire, gave her bowl bread milk. When she eaten she drew her her she sat, spoke her thus:— “Rosamond, would blessed creature instead mere wretch, must submit tried.” “Is something terrible?” asked princess, turning white. “No, child; something difficult come well of. Nobody tried knows difficult is; whoever come well it, overcome never come it, always looks back horror, she come through, idea possibility failed, still miserable creature before.” “You tell begins?” said princess. “I tell exactly. But I tell things help you. One great danger perhaps think really begun, say yourself, ‘Oh! really nothing me. It may trial some, I sure worth mentioning.’ And then, know, upon you, fail utterly shamefully.” “I very, careful,” said princess. “Only do not let frightened.” “You shall frightened, except doing. You already brave girl, occasion try way. I saw rushed middle ugly creatures; ran you, kinds evil things, long keep outside you, open cottage heart let in. I tell something go through. “Nobody real princess—do imagine yet thing mock one—until she princess herself, is, until, she finds herself unwilling thing right, she makes herself it. So long mood she makes her thing she sorry mood over, she slave, princess. A princess able right even she unhappily mood would make another unable it. For instance, cross angry, whit less bound just, yes, kind even—a thing difficult mood—though ease good mood, loving sweet. Whoever she bound do, she dirtiest little girl street, princess, worshipful, honorable. Nay, more; her might goes farther she could send it, she act so, evil mood wither die, leave her loving clean.—Do understand me, dear Rosamond?” As she spoke, wise woman laid her hand her head looked—oh, lovingly!—into her eyes. “I sure,” said princess, humbly. “Perhaps understand better I say comes this, must _not do_ wrong, however much inclined it, must _do_ right, however much disinclined it.” “I understand that,” said princess. “I going, then, put one mood-chambers I many house. Its mood come upon you, deal it.” She rose took her hand. The princess trembled little, never thought resisting. The wise woman led her great hall pictures, door farther end, opening upon another large hall, circular, doors close round it. Of she opened one, pushed princess gently in, closed behind her. The princess found herself her old nursery. Her little white rabbit came meet her lumping canter his back going tumble his head. Her nurse, her rocking-chair chimney corner, sat she used. The fire burned brightly, table many her wonderful toys, which, however, she looked contempt. Her nurse seem surprised see her, princess gone room returned again. “Oh! different I I used be!” thought princess herself, looking her toys her nurse. “The wise woman done much good already! I go see mamma once, tell her I glad home again, sorry I naughty.” She went towards door. “Your queen-mamma, princess, cannot see now,” said her nurse. “I yet learn part take orders servant,” said princess temper dignity. “I beg pardon, princess,” returned her nurse, politely; “but duty tell queen-mamma moment engaged. She alone her intimate friend, Princess Frozen Regions.” “I shall see myself,” returned princess, bridling, walked door. Now little bunny, leap-frogging near door, happened moment get her feet, she going open it, she tripped fell it, striking her forehead good blow. She caught rabbit rage, and, crying, “It fault, ugly old wretch!” threw violence her nurse’s face. Her nurse caught rabbit, held her face, seeking sooth fright. But rabbit looked limp odd, and, her amazement, Rosamond presently saw thing rabbit, pocket-handkerchief. The next moment she removed her face, Rosamond beheld—not her nurse, wise woman—standing her hearth, she herself stood door leading cottage hall. “First trial failure,” said wise woman quietly. Overcome shame, Rosamond ran her, fell her knees, hid her face her dress. “Need I say thing?” said wise woman, stroking her hair. “No, no,” cried princess. “I horrid.” “You know kind thing meet: ready try again?” “_May_ I try again?” cried princess, jumping up. “I am ready. I think I shall fail time.” “The trial harder.” Rosamond drew her breath, set her teeth. The wise woman looked her pitifully, took her hand, led her round hall, opened door, closed her. The princess expected find herself nursery, wise woman’s house one ever trial twice. She beautiful garden, full blossoming trees loveliest roses lilies. A lake middle it, tiny boat. So delightful Rosamond forgot she come there, lost herself joy flowers trees water. Presently came shout child, merry glad, clump tulip trees rushed lovely little boy, his arms stretched her. She charmed sight, ran meet him, caught her arms, kissed him, could hardly let go again. But moment she set he ran her towards lake, looking back he ran, crying “Come, come.” She followed. He made straight boat, clambered it, held his hand help her in. Then he caught little boat-hook, pushed away shore: great white flower floating yards off, little fellow’s goal. But, alas! sooner Rosamond caught sight it, huge glowing harvest moon, she felt great desire herself. The boy, however, bows boat, caught first. It long stem, reaching bottom water, moment he tugged vain, last gave way suddenly, he tumbled back flower bottom boat. Then Rosamond, almost wild danger he struggled rise, hurried save it, somehow came pieces, petals fretted silver scattered boat. When boy got up, saw ruin his companion occasioned, he burst tears, long stalk flower still his hand, struck her across face. It hurt her much, he little fellow, wet slimy. She tumbled rather rushed him, seized her arms, tore his frightened grasp, flung water. His head struck boat he fell, he sank bottom, he lay looking her white face open eyes. The moment she saw consequences her deed she filled horrible dismay. She tried hard reach water, far deeper looked, she could not. Neither could she get her eyes leave white face: eyes fascinated fixed hers; she lay leaning boat staring death she made. But voice crying, “Ally! Ally!” shot her heart, springing her feet she saw lovely lady come running grass brink water her hair flying her head. “Where Ally?” she shrieked. But Rosamond could answer, stared lady, she stared her drowned boy. Then lady caught sight dead thing bottom water, rushed in, and, plunging down, struggled groped she reached it. Then she rose stood dead body her little son her arms, his head hanging back, water streaming him. “See made him, Rosamond!” she said, holding body her; “and second trial, also failure.” The dead child melted away her arms, she stood, wise woman, her hearth, Rosamond found herself beside little well floor cottage, one arm wet shoulder. She threw herself heather-bed wept relief vexation both. The wise woman walked cottage, shut door, left her alone. Rosamond sobbing, she hear her go. When length she looked up, saw wise woman gone, her misery returned afresh tenfold, she wept wailed. The hours passed, shadows evening began fall, wise woman entered. XIII. She went straight bed, taking Rosamond her arms, sat her fire. “My poor child!” she said. “Two terrible failures! And harder! They get stronger stronger. What done?” “Could not help me?” said Rosamond piteously. “Perhaps I could, ask me,” answered wise woman. “When ready try again, shall see.” “I tired myself,” said princess. “But I cannot rest till I try again.” “That way get rid weary, shadowy self, find strong, true self. Come, child; I help I can, I _can_ help you.” Yet she led her door, seemed princess send her yet alone room. She forest, place half wild, half tended. The trees grand, full loveliest birds, glowing gleaming radiant colors, which, unlike brilliant birds know world, sang deliciously, every one according his color. The trees crowded, leaves thick, boughs spread far, sunbeam could get straight through. All gentle creatures forest there, creatures killed, even weasel kill rabbits, beetle eat snails striped shells. As butterflies, words would wrong tried tell gorgeous were. The princess’s delight great she neither laughed ran, walked solemn countenance stately step. “But flowers?” she said herself length. They nowhere. Neither high trees, shrubs grew amongst them, blossoms; grass grew everywhere single flower seen. “Ah, well!” said Rosamond herself, “where birds butterflies living flowers, without sort.” Still she could help feeling flowers wanted make beauty forest complete. Suddenly she came little open glade; there, root great oak, sat loveliest little girl, her lap full flowers colors, kinds Rosamond never seen. She playing them—burying her hands them, tumbling about, every picking one rest, throwing away. All time she never smiled, except her eyes, full could hold laughter spirit—a laughter world never heard, sets eyes alight liquid shining. Rosamond drew nearer, wonderful creature would drawn tiger her side, tamed way. A yards her, she came upon one her cast-away flowers stooped pick up, well she might none grew save her longing. But her amazement she found, instead flower thrown away wither, one fast rooted quite home. She left it, went another; also fast soil, growing comfortably warm grass. What could mean? One another she tried, length she satisfied every flower little girl threw her lap. She watched she saw her throw one, instantly bounded spot. But flower quicker she: grew, fast fixed earth, and, she thought, looked her roguishly. Something evil moved her, she plucked it. “Do not! do not!” cried child. “My flowers cannot live hands.” Rosamond looked flower. It withered already. She threw her, offended. The child rose, difficulty keeping her lapful together, picked up, carried back, sat again, spoke it, kissed it, sang it—oh! sweet, childish little song!—the princess never could recall word it—and threw away. Up rose little head, was, busy growing again! Rosamond’s bad temper soon gave way: beauty sweetness child overcome it; and, anxious make friends her, she drew near, said: “Will not give little flower, please, beautiful child?” “There are; you,” answered child, pointing her outstretched arm forefinger round. “But told me, minute ago, touch them.” “Yes, indeed, I did.” “They cannot mine, I am touch them.” “If, call yours, must kill them, yours, never, never yours. They nobody’s dead.” “But do not kill them.” “I do not pull them; I throw away. I live them.” “How make grow?” “I say, ‘You darling!’ throw away is.” “Where get them?” “In lap.” “I wish would let throw one away.” “Have got lap? Let see.” “No; I none.” “Then cannot throw one away, have not got one.” “You mocking me!” cried princess. “I mocking you,” said child, looking her full face, reproach her large blue eyes. “Oh, that is flowers come from!” said princess herself, moment she saw them, hardly knowing she meant. Then child rose hurt, quickly threw away flowers she her lap, one one, without sign anger. When gone, she stood moment, then, kind chanting cry, called, two three times, “Peggy! Peggy! Peggy!” A low, glad cry, like whinny horse, answered, and, presently, wood opposite side glade, came gently trotting loveliest little snow-white pony, great shining blue wings, half-lifted his shoulders. Straight towards little girl, neither hurrying lingering, he trotted light elastic tread. Rosamond’s love animals broke perfect passion delight vision. She rushed meet pony haste, that, although clearly best trained animal sun, he started back, plunged, reared, struck his fore-feet ere he time observe sort creature startled him. When he perceived little girl, he dropped instantly upon fours, content avoiding her, resumed his quiet trot direction his mistress. Rosamond stood gazing miserable disappointment. When he reached child, he laid his head her shoulder, she put her arm round his neck; she talked little, he turned came trotting back princess. Almost beside herself joy, she began caressing rough way which, not-withstanding her love them, she habit using animals; she gentle enough, herself even, see he like it, putting sake his mistress. But when, she might jump upon his back, she laid hold one his wings, ruffled blue feathers, he wheeled suddenly about, gave his long tail sharp whisk threw her flat grass, and, trotting back his mistress, bent his head her asking excuse ridding unbearable. The princess furious. She forgotten her past life time she first saw child: her beauty made her forget, yet she borders hating her. What she might done, rather tried do, Peggy’s tail struck her force moment she could rise, I cannot tell. But she lay half-stunned, her eyes fell little flower them. It stared her face like living thing was, she could take her eyes face. It like primrose trying express doubt instead confidence. It seemed put her half mind something, she felt shame coming. She put her hand pluck it; moment her fingers touched it, flower withered up, hung dead stalks flame fire passed it. Then shudder thrilled heart princess, she thought herself, saying—“What sort creature I flowers wither I touch them, ponies despise tails? What wretched, coarse, ill-bred creature I must be! There lovely child giving life instead death flowers, moment ago I hating her! I made horrid, I shall horrid, I hate myself, yet I cannot help myself!” She heard sound galloping feet, pony, child seated betwixt his wings, coming straight full speed she lay. “I do not care,” she said. “They may trample feet like. I tired sick myself—a creature whose touch flowers wither!” On came winged pony. But yet distance off, he gave great bound, spread his living sails blue, rose yards yards her air, alighted gently bird, feet side her. The child slipped came kneeled her. “Did pony hurt you?” she said. “I sorry!” “Yes, he hurt me,” answered princess, “but I deserved, I took liberties him, he like it.” “Oh, dear!” said little girl. “I love talking Peggy. He good pony, though little playful sometimes. Would like ride upon him?” “You darling beauty!” cried Rosamond, sobbing. “I love so, good. How become sweet?” “Would like ride pony?” repeated child, heavenly smile her eyes. “No, no; he fit you. My clumsy body would hurt him,” said Rosamond. “You do not mind pony?” said child. “What! mind it?” cried Rosamond, almost indignantly. Then remembering certain thoughts moments passed her mind, she looked ground silent. “You do not mind it, then?” repeated child. “I glad pony, got pony,” said Rosamond, still looking ground. “But I wish flowers would die I touch them. I cross see make grow, I content I make wither.” As she spoke, she stroked little girl’s bare feet, her, half buried soft moss, she ended she laid her cheek kissed them. “Dear princess!” said little girl, “the flowers always wither touch. Try now—only pluck it. Flowers ought never plucked except give away. Touch gently.” A silvery flower, something like snow-drop, grew within her reach. Timidly she stretched her hand touched it. The flower trembled, neither shrank withered. “Touch again,” said child. It changed color little, Rosamond fancied grew larger. “Touch again,” said child. It opened grew large narcissus, changed deepened color till red glowing gold. Rosamond gazed motionless. When transfiguration flower perfected, she sprang her feet clasped hands, ecstasy joy stood speechless, gazing child. “Did never see before, Rosamond?” she asked. “No, never,” answered princess. “I never saw thing half lovely.” “Look me,” said child. And Rosamond looked, child began, like flower, grow larger. Quickly every gradation growth she passed, she stood her woman perfectly beautiful, neither old young; old age everlasting youth. Rosamond utterly enchanted, stood gazing without word movement she could endure delight. Then her mind collapsed thought—had pony grown too? She glanced round. There pony, grass, flowers, bright-birded forest—but cottage wise woman—and her, hearth it, goddess-child, thing unchanged. She gasped astonishment. “You must set father’s palace immediately,” said lady. “But wise woman?” asked Rosamond, looking about. “Here,” said lady. And Rosamond, looking again, saw wise woman, folded usual her long dark cloak. “And time?” she cried delight, kneeled her, burying her face her garments. “It always me, time,” said wise woman, smiling. “But real you?” asked Rosamond; “this that?” “Or thousand others?” returned wise woman. “But one seen likest real able see yet—but—. And could seen little ago.—But, darling child,” she went on, lifting her clasping her her bosom, “you must think, seen once, therefore capable seeing times. No; many things yet must changed be. Now, however, seek me. Every time feel want me, sign I wanting you. There yet many rooms house may go through; need them, able throw flowers like little girl saw forest.” The princess gave sigh. “Do think,” wise woman went on, “that things seen house mere empty shows. You know, cannot yet think, living true are.—Now must go.” She led her great hall, showed her picture her father’s capital, his palace brazen gates. “There home,” she said. “Go it.” The princess understood, flush shame rose her forehead. She turned wise woman said: “Will forgive _all_ naughtiness, _all_ trouble I given you?” “If I forgiven you, I would never taken trouble punish you. If I loved you, think I would carried away cloak?” “How could love ugly, ill-tempered, rude, hateful little wretch?” “I saw, all, going be,” said wise woman, kissing her. “But remember yet _begun_ I saw.” “I try remember,” said princess, holding her cloak, looking her face. “Go, then,” said wise woman. Rosamond turned away instant, ran picture, stepped frame it, heard door close gently, gave one glance back, saw behind her loveliest palace-front alabaster, gleaming pale-yellow light early summer-morning, looked eastward, saw faint outline her father’s city sky, ran reach it. It looked much seemed picture, sun yet up, she whole summer day her. XIV. The soldiers sent king, great difficulty finding Agnes’s father mother, demanded knew thing young princess described. The honest pair told truth every point—that, lost child found another, taken her home, treated her own; she indeed called herself princess, believed her, she look like one; that, even had, know could done differently, seeing poor people, could afford keep idle person place; done best teach her good ways, parted her her bad temper rendered impossible put her longer; that, king’s proclamation, heard little world’s news lonely hill, never reached them; had, know either could gone distance home, left sheep cottage, one other, uncared for. “You must learn, then, go, sheep must take care cottage,” said lawyer, commanded soldiers bind hand foot. Heedless entreaties spared indignity, soldiers obeyed, bore cart, set king’s palace, leaving cottage door open, fire burning, pot potatoes boiling upon it, sheep scattered hill, dogs knowing do. Hardly gone, however, wise woman walked up, Prince behind her, peeped cottage, locked door, put key her pocket, walked away hill. In minutes arose great battle Prince dog filled his former place—a well-meaning dull fellow, could fight better feed. Prince long showing he meant his master, then, his efforts, directions dogs, sheep soon gathered again, danger foxes bad dogs. As soon done, wise woman left charge Prince, she went next farm arrange folding sheep feeding dogs. When soldiers reached palace, ordered carry prisoners presence king queen, throne room. Their two thrones stood upon high dais one end, floor foot dais, soldiers laid helpless prisoners. The queen commanded unbound, ordered stand up. They obeyed dignity insulted innocence, bearing offended foolish majesties. Meantime princess, long day’s journey, arrived palace, walked sentry gate. “Stand back,” said sentry. “I wish go in, please,” said princess gently. “Ha! ha! ha!” laughed sentry, he one dull people form judgment person’s clothes, without even looking his eyes; princess happened rags, her request amusing, booby thought quite clever laughing her thoroughly. “I princess,” Rosamond said quietly. “_What_ princess?” bellowed man. “The princess Rosamond. Is another?” she answered asked. But man tickled wondrous idea princess rags, he scarcely heard she said laughing. As soon he recovered little, he proceeded chuck princess chin, saying— “You are pretty girl, dear, though are not princess.” Rosamond drew back dignity. “You spoken three untruths once,” she said. “I _not_ pretty, I _am_ princess, I dear you, I ought be, would laugh I badly dressed, stand aside, let go father mother.” The tone her speech, rebuke she gave him, made man look her; looking her, he began tremble inside his foolish body, wonder whether he might made mistake. He raised his hand salute, said— “I beg pardon, miss, I express orders admit child whatever within palace gates. They tell his majesty king says he sick children.” “He may well sick me!” thought princess; “but cannot mean he want home again.—I do not think well call child,” she said, looking sentry full face. “You are not big, miss,” answered soldier, “but say are not child, I will take risk. The king kill me, man must die once.” He opened gate, stepped aside, allowed her pass. Had she lost her temper, every one wise woman would expected her, he certainly would done so. She ran palace, door left open porter he followed soldiers prisoners throne-room, bounded stairs look her father mother. As she passed door throne-room she heard unusual noise it, running king’s private entrance, hung heavy curtain, she peeped past edge it, saw, her amazement, shepherd shepherdess standing like culprits king queen, moment heard king say— “Peasants, princess Rosamond?” “Truly, sire, know,” answered shepherd. “You ought know,” said king. “Sire, could keep her longer.” “You confess, then,” said king, suppressing outbreak wrath boiled him, “that turned her house.” For king informed swift messenger passed long arrival prisoners. “We did, sire; could keep her longer, knew she princess.” “You ought known, moment cast eyes upon her,” said king. “Any one know princess moment he sees her, ought his eyes put out.” “Indeed he ought,” said queen. To returned answer, none ready. “Why bring her palace,” pursued king, “whether knew her princess not? My proclamation left nothing judgment. It said _every child_.” “We heard nothing proclamation, sire.” “You ought heard,” said king. “It enough I make proclamations; read them. Are written letters gold upon brazen gates palace?” “A poor shepherd, majesty—how often must he leave his flock, go hundreds miles look whether may something letters gold upon brazen gates? We know majesty made proclamation, even princess lost.” “You ought known,” said king. The shepherd held his peace. “But,” said queen, taking word, “all nothing, I think misused darling.” The ground queen saying thus, Agnes told her princess dressed; her condition seemed queen miserable, she imagined sorts oppression cruelty. But shepherdess, yet spoken, could bear. “She would dead, _not_ buried, long ago, madam, I carried her home two arms.” “Why she say her _two_ arms?” said king himself. “Has she two? Is treason that?” “You dressed her cast-off clothes,” said queen. “I dressed her sweet child’s Sunday clothes. And I get it!” cried shepherdess, bursting tears. “And clothes took her? Sell them?” “Put fire, madam. They fit poorest child mountains. They ragged could see her skin twenty different places.” “You cruel woman, torture mother’s feelings so!” cried queen, her turn burst tears. “And I am sure,” sobbed shepherdess, “I took every pains teach her right her know. I taught her tidy house and”— “Tidy house!” moaned queen. “My poor wretched offspring!” “And peel potatoes, and”— “Peel potatoes!” cried queen. “Oh, horror!” “And black her master’s boots,” said shepherdess. “Black her master’s boots!” shrieked queen. “Oh, white-handed princess! Oh, ruined baby!” “What I want know,” said king, paying heed maternal duel, patting top his sceptre hilt sword he draw, “is, princess now.” The shepherd made answer, he nothing say he said already. “You murdered her!” shouted king. “You shall tortured till confess truth; shall tortured death, abominable wretches whole wide world.” “Who accuses crime?” cried shepherd, indignant. “I accuse you,” said king; “but shall see, face face, chief witness villany. Officer, bring girl.” Silence filled hall waited. The king’s face swollen anger. The queen hid behind her handkerchief. The shepherd shepherdess bent eyes ground, wondering. It difficulty Rosamond could keep her place, wise she already become she saw would far better let every thing come she interfered. At length door opened, came officer, followed Agnes, looking white death mean sin. The shepherdess gave shriek, darted towards her arms spread wide; shepherd followed, eagerly. “My child! lost darling! Agnes!” cried shepherdess. “Hold asunder,” shouted king. “Here villany! What! I scullery-maid house born parents? The parents child must capable thing. Take three rack. Stretch till joints torn asunder, give water. Away them!” The soldiers approached lay hands them. But, behold! girl rags, radiant countenance right lovely see, darted between, careless royal presence, flung herself upon shepherdess, crying,— “Do touch her. She good, kind mistress.” But shepherdess could hear see one her Agnes, pushed her away. Then princess turned, tears her eyes, shepherd, threw her arms his neck pulled his head kissed him. And tall shepherd lifted her his bosom kept her there, his eyes fixed his Agnes. “What meaning this?” cried king, starting his throne. “How ragged girl get here? Take her away rest. She one them, too.” But princess made shepherd set her down, one could interfere she run steps dais steps king’s throne like squirrel, flung herself upon king, begun smother kisses. All stood astonished, except three peasants, even see took place. The shepherdess kept calling her Agnes, she ashamed she dare even lift her eyes meet her mother’s, shepherd kept gazing her silence. As king, he breathless aghast astonishment, he feeble fling ragged child him, he tried do. But she left him, running steps one throne other, began kissing queen next. But queen cried out,— “Get away, great rude child!—Will nobody take her rack?” Then princess, hardly knowing she joy she come time, ran steps throne dais, placing herself shepherd shepherdess, took hand each, stood looking king queen. Their faces began change. At last began know her. But she altered—so lovelily altered, wonder known her first glance; fault pride anger injustice hearts filled, know her second. The king gazed queen gazed, half risen thrones, looking tumble upon her, could right sure ragged girl child. A mistake would dreadful thing! “My darling!” last shrieked mother, little doubtfully. “My pet pets?” cried father, interrogative twist tone. Another moment, half way steps dais. “Stop!” said voice command somewhere hall, and, king queen were, stopped half way, drew up, stared, began grow angry again, durst go farther. The wise woman coming slowly crowd filled hall. Every one made way her. She came straight she stood front king queen. “Miserable man woman!” she said, words alone could hear, “I took daughter away she worthy parents; I bring her back, unworthy her. That know her she came small wonder, blind soul lives: blind body better eyes unsealed.” She threw her cloak open. It fell ground, radiance flashed her robe snowy whiteness, her face awful beauty, her eyes shone like pools sunlight, smote blind. Rosamond saw give great start, shudder, waver fro, sit steps dais; she knew punished, knew how. She rushed them, catching hand said— “Father, dear father! mother dear! I ask wise woman forgive you.” “Oh, I blind! I blind!” cried together. “Dark night! Stone blind!” Rosamond left them, sprang steps, kneeling her feet, cried, “Oh, lovely wise woman! let see. Do open eyes, dear, good, wise woman.” The wise woman bent her, said, none else could hear, “I one day. Meanwhile must servant, I yours. Bring me, I make welcome.” Rosamond rose, went steps her father mother, sat like statues closed eyes, half-way top dais stood empty thrones, seated herself them, took hand each, still. All time room saw wise woman. The moment she threw her cloak she vanished sight almost present. The woman swept dusted hall brushed thrones, saw her, shepherd glimmering vision her; one else I know caught glimpse her. The shepherdess see her. Nor Agnes, she felt her presence upon her like beat furnace seven times heated. As soon Rosamond taken her place her father mother, wise woman lifted her cloak floor, threw around her. Then everybody saw her, Agnes felt soft dewy cloud come her torrid rays vertical sun. The wise woman turned shepherd shepherdess. “For you,” she said, “you sufficiently punished work hands. Instead making daughter obey you, left her slave herself; coaxed ought compelled; praised ought silent; fondled ought punished; threatened ought inflicted—and she stands, full-grown result foolishness! She crime punishment. Take her home you, live hour hour pale-hearted disgrace call daughter. What she is, worm her heart begun teach her. When life longer endurable, come me. “Madam,” said shepherd, “may I go now?” “You shall,” said wise woman. “Husband! husband!” cried shepherdess, “how two get home without you?” “I see that,” said wise woman. “But little home find come me. The king carried hither, he shall carry back. But husband shall go you. He cannot he would.” The shepherdess looked saw shepherd stood deep sleep. She went sought rouse him, neither tongue hands slightest avail. The wise woman turned Rosamond. “My child,” she said, “I shall never far you. Come will. Bring me.” Rosamond smiled kissed her hand, kept her place her parents. They also deep sleep like shepherd. The wise woman took shepherd hand, led away. And double story. How double is, care know, must find out. If think finished—I never knew story was. I could tell great deal concerning all, I already told good read foreheads, enough made look little solemn, sigh close book.
