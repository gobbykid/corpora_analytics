 RANALD BANNERMAN’S BOYHOOD CHAPTER I Introductory I intend carry story one month beyond hour I saw boyhood gone youth arrived; period determined first tail-coat, different sign. My reason wishing tell first portion history is, I look back upon it, seems pleasant, full meaning, that, I tell right, must prove rather pleasant quite unmeaning read it. It prove poor story care stirring adventures, like better pretty strong infusion impossible; history interesting--to whom, young may be, pleasant thing world--will not, I think, find experience boy born different position them, yet much boy them, wearisome ordinary. If I mention I, Ranald Bannerman, Scotchman, I found long kind thing I tell; although England Scotland essentials one, differences one could tell once, opening his eyes, he carried one night. I mean he might puzzled, except intention puzzle skilful selection place, air, colours would tell him; he kept his eyes shut, his ears would tell without his eyes. But I offend fastidious ears syllable rougher tongue. I tell story English, neither part country like worse that. I clear way mentioning father clergyman country parish north Scotland--a humble position, involving plain living plain ways altogether. There glebe church-farm attached manse clergyman’s house, father rented small farm besides, he needed he could make farming supplement smallness living. My mother invalid far back I remember. We four boys, sister. But I must begin beginning, is, far back possible begin. CHAPTER II The Glimmer Twilight I cannot tell better readers I began come awake, wakened me. I mean, I cannot remember I began remember, first got set memory worth remembering. Sometimes I fancy must tremendous flood first made wonder, made begin remember. At events, I remember one flood seems far anything--the rain pouring thick I put hand front try whether I could see veil falling water. The river, general seen glimpses house--for ran bottom hollow--was outspread like sea front, stretched away far either hand. It little stream, fills much memory regular recurrence autumnal floods, I confidence one reality oldest thing I remember. Indeed, I suspicion oldest memories dreams,--where dreamed, good One made knows. They vague now, almost made bright things. One I recall, I relate, properly describe, hardly anything done it. I dreamed often. It room I slept in, narrower dream, loftier, window gone. But ceiling ceiling indeed; sun, moon, stars lived there. The sun scientific sun all, one see penny picture-books--a round, jolly, jocund man’s face, flashes yellow frilling about, grand sunflower would look set countenance black seeds are. And moon one may see cow jumping pictured nursery rhyme. She crescent, course, she might face drawn hollow, turned towards sun, seemed her husband. He looked merrily her, she looked trustfully him, I knew got well together. The stars children, course, seemed run ceiling pleased; sun moon regular motions--rose set proper times, steady old folks. I not, however, remember ever seeing rise set; always near centre dream dawned me. It would always come one way: I thought I awoke middle night, lo! room sun moon stars pranks revels ceiling--Mr. Sun nodding smiling across intervening space Mrs. Moon, she nodding back knowing look, corners her mouth drawn down. I vague memories heard talk. At times I feel I could yet recall something said, vanishes moment I try catch it. It queer talk, indeed--about me, I fancied--but thread strong sense ran all. When dream vivid, I would sometimes think middle next day, look sun, saying myself: He is now, busy enough. I wonder he seeing talk his wife he comes night? I think sometimes made little careful conduct. When sun set, I thought he going back way; moon rose, I thought she going little stroll I go sleep, might come talk again. It odd that, although I never fancied sun, I thought I could make moon follow I pleased. I remember eldest brother giving great offence bursting laughter, I offered, seriousness, bring her side house wanted light go something about. But I must return dream; remarkable thing I yet told you. In one corner ceiling hole, hole came ladder sun-rays--very bright lovely. Where came I never thought, course could come sun, he was, his bright coat off, playing father his family homely Old-English-gentleman fashion possible. That ladder rays could, however, doubt: I could climb upon it! I often tried, fast I lifted feet climb, came upon boards floor. At length I succeed, time dream setting. I said four boys; time five--there little baby. He ill, however, I knew he expected live. I remember looking bed one night seeing mother bending her lap;--it one things I remember mother. I fell asleep, woke looked again. No one there. Not mother baby gone, cradle gone too. I knew little brother dead. I cry: I young ignorant cry it. I went sleep again, seemed wake more; dream time. There sun moon stars. But sun moon got close together talking earnestly, stars gathered round them. I could hear word said, I concluded talking little brother. “I suppose I ought sorry,” I said myself; I tried hard, I could feel sorry. Meantime I observed curious motion heavenly host. They kept looking me, corner ladder stood, talking on, I saw lips moving fast; I thought motion saying something ladder. I got bed went it. If I could get it! I would try more. To delight I found would bear me. I climbed climbed, sun moon stars looked pleased I got nearer them, till last sun’s face broad smile. But move places, head rose them, got hole ladder came in. What I saw there, I cannot tell. I know wind never blown upon waking hours, blew upon now. I care much kisses then, I learned good are; somehow I fancied afterwards wind made baby brother’s kisses, I began love little man lived long enough brother get sun moon stars ladder sun-rays. But this, I say, I thought afterwards. Now I remember dream I began weep delight something I forgotten, I fell ladder room awoke, one always fall dream. Sun, moon, stars gone; ladder light vanished; I lay sobbing pillow. I taken great deal room story dream, clung me, would often return. And time life chapter refers like one, dream comes well enough it. There twilight mind, things strange, memory beginning know got notebook, must put things it. It long mother died, I sorrier father myself--he looked sad. I said far back I remember, she invalid. Hence she unable much us. She beautiful memory, last months her life seldom saw her, desire keep house quiet her sake must beginning freedom enjoyed whole boyhood. So every day day long, finding meals pleased, that, I shall explain, without going home them. I remember her death clearly, I dwell upon that. It sad write much about, though she happy, least troubled us all. Her sole concern leaving her husband children. But God better thing her live them. My sorrow least soon over, God makes children grief cannot cleave them. They must begin life burden loss. He knows time. When I see mother again, she reproach tears soon dried. “Little one,” I think I hear her saying, “how could go crying poor mother God mothering time, breathing life you, making world blessed place you? You tell day.” Yes, shall tell mothers--shall not?--how sorry ever gave trouble. Sometimes naughty, sometimes know better. My mother good, I cannot remember single one many kisses she must given me. I remember her holding head her bosom she dying--that all. CHAPTER III My Father My father tall, staid, solemn man, walked slowly long strides. He spoke little, generally looked he pondering next Sunday’s sermon. His head grey, little bent, he gathering truth ground. Once I came upon garden, standing his face heaven, I thought he seeing something clouds; I came nearer, I saw his eyes closed, made feel solemn. I crept away I peeping I ought not. He talk much us. What he said gentle, seemed his solemnity made gentle. I seen look angry. He used walk much his fields, especially summer morning sun up. This mother’s death. I presume he felt nearer her fields house. There kind grandeur him, I sure; I never saw one his parishioners salute road, without look father passing like solemn cloud face man woman. For us, feared loved once. I remember ever punished him, Kirsty (of I shall speak by) told he punish us small children. Neither he teach us much himself, except occasions I mention; I cannot say I learned much his sermons. These gave entire satisfaction his parishioners I happened hear speak them; but, although I loved sound his voice, liked look his face he stood ancient pulpit clad his gown bands, I never cared much he said. Of course right, better sermon clergyman whatever could preached, consequence me. I may well confess I never least doubt father best man world. Nay, hour I opinion, notwithstanding son village tailor gave tremendous thrashing saying so, ground I altogether wrong, seeing _his_ father best man world--at least I learned modify assertion extent--that father best man I ever known. The church old one--had seen candles burning, heard little bell ringing, smelt incense old Catholic service. It old, seemed settling earth, especially one side, great buttresses built keep up. It leaned like weary old thing wanted go sleep. It short square tower, like many churches England; although one old cracked bell it, although organ give glorious sounds, although neither chanting responses, I assure English readers awe reverence fell upon I crossed worn threshold nowise inferior, far I judge, awe respect feel enter beautiful churches country. There hush demanded refraining foot, treading softly upon holy ground; church inseparably associated father. The pew sat square one, table middle books. My brother David generally used laying his head upon, he might go sleep comfortably. My brother Tom put his feet cross-bar it, leaned back his corner--for see corner apiece--put his hands his trousers pockets, stared hard father--for Tom’s corner well front pulpit. My brother Allister, whose back pulpit, used learn _paraphrases_ time sermon. I, happiest position, could look father, I pleased, little sideways; or, I preferred, I confess I often did, study--a rare sight Scotch churches--the figure armed knight, carved stone, lay top tomb Sir Worm Wymble--at least nearest I come spelling name gave him. The tomb close side pew, flagged passage between. It stood hollow wall, knight lay arch recess, silent, patient, folded palms, praying help he could name. From presence labour sculptor came certain element feeling place, could otherwise possessed: organ chant altogether needful carved knight lay face upturned, looking heaven. But gazing knight I began regard wall him, arch him; arch eye would seek roof, descending, rest pillars, wander windows, searching building place, discovering points strength, upheld. So father talking church company believers, describing held together faith, I trying understand stone lime old place kept falling asunder, thus beginning follow become profession since; I architect. But church led away father. He always spoke rather low voice, earnestly every eye, seemed me, mine two brothers, fixed upon him. I think, however, part fault certain teaching his own, better fitted understanding, paid little heed. Even Tom, his staring, knew little sermon us. But father question us much concerning it; he far better. On Sunday afternoons, warm, peaceful sunlight summer, honeysuckle filling air little arbour sat, his one glass wine set table middle, he would sit hour talking away us his gentle, slow, deep voice, telling us story story New Testament, explaining way I seldom heard equalled. Or, cold winter nights, he would come room I two younger brothers slept--the nursery was--and, sitting Tom his side fire burned bright frosty air, would open great family Bible table, turn his face towards two beds three lay wide awake, tell us story story Old Testament, sometimes reading verses, sometimes turning bare facts expanded illustrated narrative his own, which, Shakspere fashion, he presented modes ways country time. I shall never forget Joseph Egypt hearing pattering asses’ hoofs street, throwing window, looking out, seeing his brothers coming riding towards him; grand rush sea waves bewildered hosts Egyptians. We lay listened enjoyment, fire burning brightly, presence father filling room safety peace, wind howling outside, snow drifting window. Sometimes I passed land sleep his voice ears his love heart; perhaps land visions--once certainly dream sun moon stars making obeisance too-favoured son Jacob. CHAPTER IV Kirsty My father housekeeper, trusty woman, he considered her. We thought her _very_ old. I suppose she forty. She pleasant, she grim-faced censorious, straight back, long upper lip. Indeed distance her nose her mouth greater length her nose. When I think her first, always making complaint father us. Perhaps she meant speak truth, rather, perhaps took granted she always speak truth; certainly she would exaggerate things, give quite another look. The bones her story might true, she would put skin her fashion, one mildness charity. The consequence older grew, minds alienated her, came regard her enemy. If she really meant friend best fashion she knew, least uncomely kind friendship, showed constant opposition, fault-finding, complaint. The real mistake boys. There something her altogether antagonistic boy-nature. You would thought boy her eyes something wrong begin with; boys ought never made; must always, nature, something amiss. I occasionally wondered she would behaved girl. On reflection, I think little better; girl would worse off, she could escaped her did. My father would hear her complaints end without putting word, except ask her question, she finished, would turn his book his sermon, saying-- “Very well, Mrs. Mitchell; I speak it.” My impression he believe half she told him. At events, he sent us, he would ask version affair, listen he listened hers. Then he would set forth us wrong, wrong, send us away injunction provoke Mrs. Mitchell, could not help short her temper, poor thing! Somehow got heads shortness her temper mysteriously associated shortness her nose. She saving even stinginess. She would her best provide father liked, us she thought almost anything good enough. She would, instance, give us thinnest milk--we said she skimmed three times she thought blue enough us. My two younger brothers mind much I did, I always rather delicate, I took dislike anything, would rather go without eat drink it. But I told enough her make plain she could favourite us; enough likewise serve background description Kirsty. Kirsty Highland woman charge house farm servants lived. She cheerful, gracious, kind woman--a woman God’s making, one would say, that, however mysterious may look, cannot deny he made Mrs. Mitchell too. It puzzling, I confess. I remember youngest brother Davie, little fellow then, he could speak plainly, came running great distress Kirsty, crying, “Fee, fee!” he meant indicate flea rendering his life miserable. Kirsty undressed entered pursuit. After successful search, she putting his garments again, little Davie, looking solemn thoughtful time, said, questioning, concluding tone-- “God did not make fees, Kirsty!” “Oh yes, Davie! God made everything. God make fleas,” said Kirsty. Davie silent while. Then he opened his mouth spake like discontented prophet old: “Why does not he give something else eat, then?” “You must ask that,” said Kirsty, wisdom I since learned comprehend, though I remember shocked little time. All set thinking. Before dressing little Davie over, I _my_ question put Kirsty. It was, fact, question, important object eye it. “_Then_ I suppose God made Mrs. Mitchell, well rest us, Kirsty?” I said. “Certainly, Ranald,” returned Kirsty. “Well, I wish he had not,” remark, I imitated baby brother, always much cleverer I. “Oh! she is bad sort,” said Kirsty; “though I must say, I her, I would try little agreeable.” To return Kirsty: she constant resort. The farmhouse furlong manse, blood pouring cut finger, feet would devour furlong rather apply Mrs. Mitchell. Oh! she dear, good, kind, Kirsty! In person she short slender, keen blue eyes dark hair; uncommonly small foot, she claimed Highland folk; light step, sweet voice, bounteous hand--but I come moral nature her, mind makes hand bountiful. For her face, I think rather queer, truth I hardly tell, entirely sign good brothers; short, I loved her much I know now, even I care then, whether she nice-looking not. She quite old Mrs. Mitchell, never thought _her_ old. She refuge time trouble necessity. It she gave us something eat often much wanted. She used say cheating minister feed minister’s boys. And her stories! There nothing like countryside. It rather dreary country outward aspect, many bleak moorland hills, lay like slow-stiffened waves, great height much desolation; far imagination concerned, would seem minds former generations bleak country, left small store legends sort. But Kirsty come region hills hills indeed--hills mighty skeletons stone inside them; hills looked heaped huge monsters ever trying get up--a country every cliff, rock, well story--and Kirsty’s head full such. It delight indeed sit her fire listen them. That would men supper, early winter night, gone, two village, attend horses. Then herd, called boy attended cattle, whose work night, would sit fire, Kirsty would tell us stories, heaven. CHAPTER V I Begin Life I began life, pleasant fashion, near I guess, age six years. One glorious morning early summer I found led ungentle hand Mrs. Mitchell towards little school outside village, kept old woman called Mrs. Shand. In English village I think she would called Dame Shand: called her Luckie Shand. Half dragged along road Mrs. Mitchell, whose rough grasp I attempted vain extricate hand, I looked around shining fields blue sky, lark singing he found he could sing, something like despair man going gallows bidding farewell world. We cross little stream, reached middle foot-bridge, I tugged yet imprisoned hand, half-formed intention throwing brook. But efforts still unavailing. Over half-mile so, rendered weary unwillingness, I led cottage door--no cottage readers picture, roses honeysuckle hiding walls, dreary little house nothing green cover brown stones built, open ditch front stone slab bridge. Did I say nothing walls? This morning loveliest sunshine, I going leave behind. It bitter, especially I expected go elder brother spend day neighbouring farm. Mrs. Mitchell opened door, led in. It awful experience. Dame Shand stood her table ironing. She tall Mrs. Mitchell, enough prejudice her once. She wore close-fitting widow’s cap, black ribbon round it. Her hair grey, her face grey her hair, her skin gathered wrinkles her mouth, twitched twitched, she constantly meditating something unpleasant. She looked inquiringly. “I have brought new scholar,” said Mrs. Mitchell. “Well. Very well,” said dame, dubious tone. “I hope he is good boy, he must good he comes here.” “Well, he is middling. His father spares rod, Mrs. Shand, know comes that.” They went talk, which, far I recall it, complimentary none two women themselves. Meantime I making observations terror would allow. About dozen children seated forms along walls, looking tops spelling-books newcomer. In farther corner two kicking opportunity offered, looking angry, daring cry. My next discovery terribly disconcerting. Some movement drew eyes floor; I saw boy age all-fours, fastened string leg table dame ironing, while--horrible relate!--a dog, big ugly, big enough frightened at, lay table watching him. I gazed utter dismay. “Ah, may look!” said dame. “If you are good boy, shall served. The dog shall look after.” I trembled, speechless. After confabulation, Mrs. Mitchell took her leave, saying-- “I will come back one of the clock, I do not come, keep till I come.” The dame accompanied her door, I discovered she lame, hobbled much. A resolution arose full-formed brain. I sat form near door, kept quiet. Had intention I cherished, I sure I cried. When dame returned, she resumed her box-iron, heater went rattling about, as, standing one leg--the much shorter--she moved fro garment table. Then she called her name would-be pompous manner. I obeyed, trembling. “Can say letters?” she asked. Now, although I could read, I could repeat alphabet; I learned I know. I repeat it. “How many questions catechism say?” she asked next. Not knowing certainty she meant, I silent. “No sulking!” said dame; opening drawer table, she took catechism. Turning back cover she put hand, told learn first question. She even inquired whether I could read. I took catechism, stood before. “Go seat,” she said. I obeyed, book pondered plan. Everything depended whether I could open door she could reach me. Once house, I sure running faster she could follow. And soon I first experience helped help themselves. The ironing course required fire make irons hot, morning went on, sunshine walls, conspiring fire hearth, made place hot comfort old dame. She went set door wide open. I instantly alert, watching opportunity. One soon occurred. A class five six reading, reading could called, Bible. At length came turn one blundered dreadfully. It boy tied table, he released his lesson. The dame hobbled him, found he his book upside down; whereupon she turned wrath table, took drawer long leather strap, she proceeded chastise him. As his first cry reached ears I halfway door. On threshold I stumbled fell. “The new boy’s running away!” shrieked little sycophant inside. I heard horror, I moment. I not, however, got many yards cottage I heard voice dame screaming return. I took heed--only sped faster. But horror find her command enforced pursuing bark her prime minister. This paralysed me. I turned, fiendish-looking dog close heels. I could run longer. For one moment I felt I sink earth sheer terror. The next moment wholesome rage sent blood brain. From abject cowardice wild attack--I cannot call courage--was change instant. I rushed towards little wretch. I know fight him, desperation I threw upon him, dug nails him. They fortunately found way his eyes. He veriest coward his species. He yelped howled, struggling grasp ran his tail merged his person back his mistress, hobbling me. But renewed strength triumph I turned home, ran I never run before. When dame gave in, I know; I never turned head I laid Kirsty’s bosom, I burst sobbing crying. It utterance I left. As soon Kirsty succeeded calming me, I told her whole story. She said little, I could see she angry. No doubt she pondering could done. She got milk--half cream I believe, nice--and oatcake, went her work. While I ate I reflected moment Mrs. Mitchell might appear drag back disgrace horrible den. I knew Kirsty’s authority equal hers, she would compelled give up. So I watched opportunity escape hide myself, Kirsty might able say she know I was. When I finished, Kirsty left kitchen moment, I sped noiselessly door, looked farmyard. There one seen. Dark brown cool door barn stood open, inviting shelter safety; I knew darkest end lay great heap oat-straw. I sped across intervening sunshine darkness, began burrowing straw like wild animal, drawing handfuls laying carefully aside, disorder betray retreat. When I made hole large enough hold me, I got in, kept drawing straw behind me, filling hole front. This I continued I stopped entrance, placed good thickness straw outside. By time I burrowed far I thought necessary, I tired, lay full length hole, delighting sense safety I never experienced. I soon fast asleep. CHAPTER VI No Father I woke, creeping lair, peeping door barn, looked cornyard, found sun going down. I already discovered I getting hungry. I went door close farmyard, ran across house. No one there. Something moved climb form look little window, I could see manse road it. To dismay, Mrs. Mitchell coming towards farm. I possessed wits sufficiently run first Kirsty’s press secure good supply oatcake, I sped like hunted hare her form. I soon drawn stopper straw mouth hole, where, hearing one approach, I began eat oatcake, fell asleep I finished. And I slept I dreamed dream. The sun looking grave, moon reflected his concern. They satisfied me. At length sun shook his head; is, his whole self oscillated axis, moon thereupon shook herself response. Then nodded much say, “That entirely opinion.” At last began talk; men converse, once, yet listening spoke. I heard word, lips moved busily; eyebrows went down; eyelids winked winked, cheeks puckered relaxed incessantly. There absolute storm expression upon faces; noses twisted curled. It seemed if, agony talk, countenances would go pieces. For stars, darted hither thither, gathered groups, dispersed, formed new groups, faces yet, sort celestial tadpoles, indicated motions alone took active interest questions agitating parents. Some kept darting ladder rays, like phosphorescent sparks sea foam. I could bear longer, awoke. I darkness, bed. When I proceeded turn, I found hemmed sides. I could stretch arms, hardly room body feet head. I dreadfully frightened first, felt I slowly stifled. As brain awoke, I recalled horrible school, horrible schoolmistress, horrible dog, whose defeat, however, I rejoiced pride dragon-slayer. Next I thought would well look abroad reconnoitre more. I drew away straw entrance lair; dismay find even hand went space light came opening. What could mean? Surely I grown blind I lay asleep. Hurriedly I shot remainder stopper straw, crept hole. In great barn dullest glimmer light; I almost said clumsiest reduction darkness. I tumbled one doors rather ran it. I found fast, one I knew fastened inside wooden bolt bar, I could draw back. The open door revealed dark night. Before cornyard, called it, full ricks. Huge positive although dim, rose betwixt sky. Between tops I saw stars darkness. I turned looked back barn. It appeared horrible cave filled darkness. I remembered rats it. I dared enter again, even go opposite door: I forgot soundly peacefully I slept it. I stepped night grass corn-yard feet, awful vault heaven head, shadowy ricks around me. It relief lay hand one them, feel solid. I half groped way them, got open field, creeping stems hawthorn hedge, course hundred years grown grimmest, largest, grotesque trees I ever seen kind. I always little afraid them, even daytime, hurt, I stood vast hall silent night--alone: lay awfulness it. I never known night was. The real sting fear lay this--that nobody else it. Everybody besides asleep world, abandoned fate, whatever might come darkness seize me. When I got round edge stone wall, another side bounded corn-yard, moon--crescent, I saw her dream, low towards horizon, lying almost upon her rounded back. She looked disconsolate dim. Even she would take heed me, abandoned child! The stars high up, away heavens. They look like children sun moon all, _they_ took heed me. Yet grandeur desolation would elevated heart fear. If I one living creature nigh me--if stupid calf, whose dull sleepy low startled dreadfully I stood staring me! It dark open field, season year dark night long, sky unclouded. Away north Great Bear. I knew constellation, one men taught find pole-star. Nearly light sun, creeping round north towards spot east he would rise again. But I learned afterwards understand this. I gazed pale faded light, I remembered God near me. But I know God I know now, I thought then, neither much often, idea like him; merely confused mixture people’s fancies own. I learned beautiful God is; I learned he strong. I told he angry wrong; I understood he loved time, although he displeased them, must punish make good. When I thought silent starry night, yet greater terror seized me, I ran stumbling uneven field. Does reader wonder whither I fled? Whither I fly home? True, Mrs. Mitchell there, another well. Even Kirsty would terror. Home refuge, father there. I sped manse. But I approached new apprehension laid hold trembling heart. I sure, I thought door always locked night. I drew nearer. The place possible refuge rose me. I stood grass-plot front it. There light eyes. Its mouth closed. It silent one ricks. Above shone speechless stars. Nothing alive. Nothing would speak. I went rough-hewn granite steps led door. I laid hand handle, gently turned it. Joy joys! door opened. I entered hall. Ah! silent night. No footsteps echoed; voices there. I closed door behind me, and, almost sick misery comfort it, I groped way father’s room. When I hand his door, warm tide courage began flow heart. I opened door quietly, dragon asleep below? “Papa! papa!” I cried, eager whisper. “Are awake, papa?” No voice came reply, place yet silent night hall. He must asleep. I afraid call louder. I crept nearer bed. I stretched hands feel him. He must farther side. I climbed bed. I felt across it. Utter desertion seized soul--my father there! Was horrible dream? Should I ever awake? My heart sank totally within me. I could bear more. I fell bed weeping bitterly, wept asleep. Years after, I young man, I read Jean Paul’s terrible dream God, desolation night key dream. Once I awoke sense misery, stretched arms, crying, “Papa! papa!” The moment I found father’s arms around me; he folded close him, said-- “Hush, Ranald, boy! Here I am! You quite safe.” I nestled close I could go, wept blessedness. “Oh, papa!” I sobbed, “I thought I lost you.” “And I thought I lost you, boy. Tell it.” Between narrative replies his questionings he soon gathered whole story, I turn learned dismay household I appear. Kirsty told she knew. They searched everywhere, could find me; great misery been, father’s greater mine. While I stood forsaken desolate field, searching along banks river. But herd idea, although already searched barn every place could think of, he left ran back search farm. Guided scattered straw, he soon came upon deserted lair, sped back riverside news, father returned, failing find bed, his infinite relief found fast asleep his; fast, he undressed laid bed without opening eyes--the strange, I already slept long. But sorrow sleepy. Having thus felt awfulness majesty heavens night, long time I dreamed childish dream. CHAPTER VII Mrs. Mitchell Defeated After talk father I fell sleep perfect contentment, never thought might morrow till morrow came. Then I grew aware danger I carried school. Indeed, except father interfered, thing almost inevitable. I thought he would protect me, I assurance. He gone again, for, I mentioned already, he given going early mornings. It early now, however; I slept much longer usual. I got once, intending find him; but, horror, I half dressed, enemy, Mrs. Mitchell, came room, looking triumphant revengeful. “I am glad see you are getting up,” she said; “it is nearly school-time.” The tone, emphasis she laid word _school_, would sufficed reveal state her mind, even her eyes fierce suppressed indignation. “I have not porridge,” I said. “Your porridge waiting you--as cold stone,” she answered. “If boys lie bed late, expect?” “Nothing you,” I muttered, hardihood I yet shown her. “What is you are saying?” she asked angrily. I silent. “Make haste,” she went on, “and do not keep waiting day.” “You need not wait, Mrs. Mitchell. I dressing fast I can. Is papa his study yet?” “No. And need not think see him. He is angry enough you, I will warrant” She little knew passed father already. She could imagine talk had. “You need not think run away yesterday. I know Mrs. Shand told I should not wonder papa’s gone see her now, tell her sorry he naughty.” “I am going, school.” “We will see that” “I tell I will not go.” “And I tell we will see it” “I will not go till I have seen papa. If he says I am go, I course; I will not go you.” “You _will_, _won’t_!” she repeated, standing staring me, I leisurely, hands trembling partly fear, partly rage, fastening nether garments waistcoat. “That is fine, I know something good deal finer. Now wash face.” “I will not, long stand there,” I said, sat floor. She advanced towards me. “If touch me, I will scream,” I cried. She stopped, thought moment, bounced room. But I heard her turn key door. I proceeded dressing fast I could then; moment I ready, opened window, feet ground, scrambled out, dropped. I hurt little, much, fled harbour Kirsty’s arms. But I turned corner house I ran right Mrs. Mitchell’s, received soft embrace. In fact I rather severely scratched a. pin bosom her dress. “There! serves right,” she cried. “That is judgment trying run away again. After trouble gave us yesterday too! You bad boy.” “Why I bad boy?” I retorted. “It is bad told.” “I papa tells me.” “Your papa! There people papa world.” “I am bad boy I do not anybody like chooses tell me, I?” “None impudence!” This accompanied box ear. She dragging kitchen. There she set porridge me, I declined eat. “Well, will not eat good food, shall go school without it.” “I tell I will not go school.” She caught her arms. She strong, I could prevent her carrying house. If I bad boy she said I was, I could biting scratching soon compelled her set down; I felt I must that, I ashamed father. I therefore yielded time, fell planning. Nor I long coming resolution. I drew pin scratched her dress. I believed she would carry far; she set soon, I resolved make her glad so. Further I resolved, came foot-bridge, one rail it, I would run pin her make her let go, I would instantly throw river, I would run risk drowned rather go school. Were griefs yesterday, overcome point forgotten, frustrated fashion? My whole blood boiling. I convinced father want go. He could kind night, send place morning. But happily general peace, things arrive desperate pass. Before gate, heart leaped joy, I heard father calling, “Mrs. Mitchell! Mrs. Mitchell!” I looked round, seeing coming us his long slow strides, I fell struggling violently strength hope she glad set down. I broke her, ran father, burst crying. “Papa! papa!” I sobbed, “do not send horrid school. I learn read without old woman teach me.” “Really, Mrs. Mitchell,” said father, taking hand leading towards her, she stood visibly flaming rage annoyance, “really, Mrs. Mitchell, taking much upon you! I never said child go woman’s school. In fact I do not approve I hear her, I thought consulting brethren presbytery matter taking steps myself. I will not young people parish oppressed fashion. Terrified dogs too! It shameful.” “She is decent woman, Mistress Shand,” said housekeeper. “I do not dispute her decency, Mrs. Mitchell; I doubt much whether she fit charge children; she friend yours, her kindness give her hint effect. It _may_ save necessity taking unpleasant steps.” “Indeed, sir, leave, would hard lines take bread mouth lone widow woman, bring her upon parish bad name boot. She is supported herself years her school, trouble nobody.” “Except lambs flock, Mrs. Mitchell.--I like standing friend; woman, she lone widow, make Moloch herself, children sacrificed her way? It is enough make idiots them. She better see it. You tell her that--from me, like. And do not meddle school affairs. I will take young men,” he added smile, “to school I see fit.” “I am sure, sir,” said Mrs. Mitchell, putting her blue striped apron her eyes, “I asked opinion I took him.” “I believe I say something time he able read, I recollect nothing more.--You must misunderstood me,” he added, willing ease her descent valley her humiliation. She walked away without another word, sniffing air she went, carrying her hands folded her apron. From hour I believe she hated me. My father looked her smile, looked me, saying-- “She is short temper, poor woman! must not provoke her.” I well satisfied urge victory complaint. I could afford let well alone, I delivered fiery furnace, earth sky laughing around me. Oh! sunshine filled world! How glad larks, praisers amongst birds, blessed morning! The demon oppression hidden her head ashamed, fled her den! CHAPTER VIII A New Schoolmistress “But, Ranald,” father continued, “what reading? I fear I let go long. I did not want make learning burden you, I do not approve children learning read soon; really, age, know, time beginning. I time teach things, I cannot teach everything. I got read great deal think great deal, go parish good deal. And brother Tom heavy lessons learn school, I help him. So what is done, Ranald, boy? You cannot go parish school you have learned letters.” “There is Kirsty, papa,” I suggested. “Yes; there is Kirsty,” he returned sly smile. “Kirsty everything, cannot she?” “She speak Gaelic,” I said tone triumph, bringing her rarest accomplishment forefront. “I wish could speak Gaelic,” said father, thinking his wife, I believe, whose mother tongue was. “But want learn. Do think Kirsty could teach read English?” “Yes, I do.” My father meditated. “Let us go ask her,” he said length, taking hand. I capered delight, ceased capering till stood Kirsty’s earthen floor. I think I see her now, dusting one her deal chairs, white soap sand could make it, minister sit on. She never called _the master_, always _the minister_. She great favourite father, he always behaved visitor her house. “Well, Kirsty,” he said, first salutations over, “have objection turn schoolmistress?” “I make poor hand that,” she answered, smile showed she guessed father wanted. “But teach Master Ranald there, I like dearly try I could do.” She never omitted _Master_ names; Mrs. Mitchell chance prefixed it. The natural manners Celt Saxon almost diametrically opposed Scotland. And Kirsty’s speech coarse dialect Mrs. Mitchell, I confident father would allowed her teach me. But Kirsty speak word Scotch, although her English little broken odd, formed somewhat Gaelic idioms, her tone pure her phrases refined. The matter speedily settled them. “And want beat him, Kirsty, beat Gaelic, he will not feel it,” said father, trying joke, common occurrence him, whereupon Kirsty I laughed great contentment. The fact was, Kirsty come manse mother, father attached her sake his wife well her own, Kirsty would died minister one his boys. All devotion Highland woman chief her clan, Kirsty father, mention reverence due minister. After little chat cows calves, father rose, saying-- “Then I will make you, Kirsty. Do think manage without letting interfere work, though?” “Oh yes, sir--well that! I shall soon reading I am busy about. If he does not know word, he spell it, I shall know it--at least it is longer Hawkie’s tail.” Hawkie fine milker, bad temper, comically short tail. It got chopped accident she calf. “There is something else short Hawkie--is not there, Kirsty?” said father. “And Mrs. Mitchell,” I suggested, thinking help Kirsty father’s meaning. “Come, come, young gentleman! We do not want remarks,” said father pleasantly. “Why, papa, told yourself, came up.” “Yes, I did; I mean repeat it. What Kirsty go tell Mrs. Mitchell?” Kirsty made attempt protestation. She knew well enough father knew danger. She laughed, I, seeing Kirsty satisfied, satisfied also, joined laugh. The result many weeks over, Allister wee Davie Kirsty’s pupils also, Allister learning read, wee Davie sit still, hardest task within his capacity. They free come keep away, go: come, Kirsty insisted staying lesson. It soon became regular thing. Every morning summer might seen perched form, one tiny windows, delicious brown light seldom find old clay-floored cottage. In fir-wood I think it; I seen old castle; best house mourning Arab cemetery. In winter, seated round fire--as near Kirsty’s cooking operations, simple enough, admitted. It delightful us boys, would amusing anyone, see Kirsty behaved Mrs. Mitchell found occasion pay her visit lesson hours. She knew her step darted door. Not she permit her enter. She like hen her chickens. “No, you will come now, Mrs. Mitchell,” she would say, housekeeper attempted pass. “You know we are busy.” “I want hear they are getting on.” “You try home,” Kirsty would answer. We always laughed idea reading her. Once I believe she heard laugh, she instantly walked away, I remember she ever came again. CHAPTER IX We Learn Other Things We ever farm now. During summer, time got till time went bed, seldom approached manse. I heard hinted father neglected us. But hardly be, seeing his word law us, I regard his memory symbol love unspeakable. My elder brother Tom always his meals him, sat his lessons study. But father mind younger ones running wild, long Kirsty run to; indeed men also friendly us, careful us. No doubt rather savage, different appearance town-bred children, washed dressed every time go walk: considered merely hardship, indignity. To free notion perfect existence. But father’s rebuke awful indeed, he found even youngest guilty untruth, cruelty, injustice. At kinds escapades, involving disobedience, he smiled, except indeed much danger, he would warn limit. A town boy may wonder could find amuse us day long; fact almost everything amusement, seeing could take natural share going on, generally managed invent collateral employment fictitiously related it. But he must think farm like great farm he may happen know England; nothing done machinery place. There may great pleasure watching machine-operations, surely none equal pleasure had. If steam engine plough father’s fields, could ridden home back evening? To ride horses home plough triumph. Had thrashing-machine, could pleasures comparable lying straw watching grain dance sheaves skilful flails two strong men belaboured them? There winnowing-machine, quite tame one, wheel I could drive myself--the handle high head, low knee--and watch time storm chaff driven like drifting snowflakes wide mouth. Meantime oat-grain flowing silent slow stream shelving hole side, wind, rushing opposite doors, aided winnower catching expelled chaff, carrying yet farther apart. I think I see old Eppie now, filling her sack wind blew her; grain: Eppie covet that; she wanted her bed filled fresh springy chaff, she would sleep sound her rheumatism would let her, warm dry comfortable duchess land happened rheumatism too. For comfort inside outside; eider down, delicious is, less people fancy. How I wish poor people great cities could good chaff beds lie upon! Let see: machines now? More I tell. I saw one going fields day, use I could guess. Strange, wild-looking, mad-like machines, Scotch would call them, growling snapping, clinking clattering fields, seems old boy sweet poetic twilight things vanishing country; he reminds God going sleep, for, one greatest poets ever lived says, _he slumbereth sleepeth_; children earth his, he see imaginations feelings food enough spare. It his business this--not ours. So work must done well can. Then, indeed, fear poetry. I alluded pleasure riding horses, is, work-horses: upon Allister I began ride, far I remember, summer--not plough, ploughing end year spring. First allowed take watering-time, watched one men, stable long trough stood pump. There, going hurriedly stopping suddenly, would drop head neck shoulders like certain toy-bird, causing young riders vague fear falling height longer defended uplifted crest; drink drink till riders’ legs felt horses’ bodies swelling them; away quick refreshed stride trot towards paradise stalls. But us came first somewhat fearful pass stable door, never stopped, like better educated horses, let riders dismount, walked right in, room, stooping low, clear top door. As improved equitation, would go afield, ride home pasture, fastened chains short stakes iron driven earth. There adventure here, ride longer, horses frisky, would sometimes set gallop. Then chief danger door, lest dash in, knock knees posts heads lintels, halters hold with. But I thrown back neck, neck ground clumsy wild gallop extemporized Dobbin, I raised dignity bridle, I always carried went fetch them. It father’s express desire could sit well bare back allowed saddle. It whole year I permitted mount his little black riding mare, called Missy. She old, true--nobody quite knew old she was--but she felt light weight her back, either spirit youth contagious, she fancied herself young she thought nothing twelve stone, would dart like wind. In years I got found her, I would stand her side flacking flies her she grazed; I tired that, would clamber upon her back, lie reading book, she plucked ground mashed away grass nobody near her. Then choice, nothing else found attractive, going field cattle grazing. Oh! rich hot summer afternoons among grass clover, little lamb-daisies, big horse-daisies, cattle feeding solemnly, one another straying corn, turnips, recalled stern shouts, or, unavailing, vigorous pursuit even blows! If I able think mother home, I perfectly happy. Not I missed her then; I lost her young that. I mean memory time wants render perfect bliss. Even cold days spring, when, shut winter, cattle allowed revel springing grass venturesome daisies, pleasure enough company devices cowherd, freckle-faced, white-haired, weak-eyed boy ten, named--I forget his real name: always called Turkey, his nose colour turkey’s egg. Who Turkey knew mushrooms toadstools? Who Turkey could detect earth-nuts--and certainty truffle-hunting dog? Who Turkey knew note form nest eggs every bird country? Who Turkey, his little whip lash brass wire, would encounter angriest bull Christendom, provided he carried, like bulls Scotland, his sensitive part, nose, foremost? In eyes Turkey hero. Who Turkey could discover nests hens whose maternal anxiety eluded _finesse_ Kirsty? well he could roast egg she always rewarded discovery? Words feeble delight experienced occasion, Turkey, proceeding light fire one earthen walls divided fields, would send us abroad gather sticks straws whatever outcast combustibles could find, great scarcity, woods hedges within reach. Who like Turkey could rob wild bee’s nest? And could he distributing luscious prize? In fine, his accomplishments innumerable. Short flying, believed capable everything imaginable. What rendered yet dearer us, enmity Mrs. Mitchell. It came way. Although good milker, therefore necessity good feeder, Hawkie yet upon temptation subject inroads unnatural appetite. When she found piece old shoe field, she would, compelled drop delicious mouthful, go on, whole morning afternoon, impossibility final deglutition, chewing chewing savoury morsel. Should happened, vain Turkey hope escape discovery his inattention, milk-pail would evening next morning reveal fact Kirsty’s watchful eyes. But fortunately us, far well ally enemy, Hawkie’s morbid craving confined old shoes. One day cattle feeding close manse, she found holly-hedge surrounded it, Mrs. Mitchell’s best cap, laid bleach sun. It tempting morsel--more susceptible mastication shoe-leather. Mrs. Mitchell, gone another freight linen she sprinkling hedge, arrived time see end one long strings gradually disappearing Hawkie’s mouth way rest cap, gone length string farther. With wild cry despair she flew Hawkie, intent stolen delicacy open surprise usual, laying hold string, drew her throat deplorable mass pulp she reduced valued gaud. The moment Turkey, come running her cry, received full his face slimy sloppy extract. Nor all, Mrs. Mitchell flew her fury, outburst abuse boxed his ears soundly, he could recover his senses sufficiently run it. The degradation treatment converted Turkey enemy ever he knew also good grounds disliking her. His opinion concerning her freely expressed us one else, generally terms. He said she bad she ugly, always spoke her _the old witch_. But brought Turkey us together anything else, he fond Kirsty’s stories were; winter especially would sit together evening, I already said, round her fire great pot upon full delicious potatoes, Kirsty knitted away vigorously her blue broad-ribbed stockings, kept sort time her story sound her needles. When story flagged, needles went slower; animated passages would become invisible swiftness, save certain shimmering flash hovered her fingers like dim electric play; story approached crisis, motion would one time become perfectly frantic, another cease altogether, finding subject beyond power accompanying expression. When ceased, knew something awful indeed hand. In next chapter I give specimen her stories, choosing one bears little upon adventure. CHAPTER X Sir Worm Wymble It snowy evening depth winter. Kirsty promised tell us tale armed knight lay stone upon tomb church; snow deep, Mrs. Mitchell, always glad nature put her power exercise her authority way disagreeable us, refused let little ones go day. Therefore Turkey I, darkness began grow thick enough, went prowling watching manse found opportunity she way. The moment occurred darted nursery, ground floor, catching two brothers, I wee Davie, he Allister, hoisted backs rushed house. It snowing. It came huge flakes, although half-past four of the clock, show whiteness, light shine upon them. You might thought mud cloud came from, turned dark grey. How little ones enjoy it, spurring horses suppressed laughter, urging us lest old witch hear overtake us! But hard work one horses, myself. Turkey scudded away his load, made nothing it; wee Davie pulled hard his little arms round neck, especially he bobbing urge on, half delight, half terror, he nearly choked me; I went one foot scarcely beaten path, I sunk deep fresh snow. “Doe on, doe on, Yanal!” cried Davie; Yanal his best, halfway farm, Turkey came bounding back take Davie him. In moments shaken snow shoes Davie’s back, stood around Kirsty’s “booful baze”, Davie called fire. Kirsty seated herself one side Davie her lap, three got chairs near her could, Turkey, valiant man party, farthest centre safety, namely Kirsty, time source delightful horror. I may well say I believe Kirsty’s tale remotest historical connection Sir Worm Wymble, anything like name dead knight. It old Highland legend, she adorned flowers her Celtic fancy, swathed around form familiar us all. “There pot Highlands,” began Kirsty, “not far house, bottom little glen. It big, fearfully deep; deep say bottom it.” “An iron pot, Kirsty?” asked Allister. “No, goosey,” answered Kirsty. “A pot means great hole full water--black, black, deep, deep.” “Oh!” remarked Allister, silent. “Well, pot lived kelpie.” “What is kelpie, Kirsty?” interposed Allister, general asked necessary questions least many unnecessary. “A kelpie awful creature eats people.” “But like, Kirsty?” “It is something like horse, head like cow.” “How big it? As big Hawkie?” “Bigger Hawkie; bigger biggest ox ever saw.” “Has great mouth?” “Yes, terrible mouth.” “With teeth?” “Not many, dreadfully big ones.” “Oh!” “Well, shepherd many years ago, lived far pot. He knowing man, understood kelpies brownies fairies. And he put branch rowan-tree (_mountain-ash_), red berries it, door his cottage, kelpie could never come in. “Now, shepherd beautiful daughter--so beautiful kelpie wanted much eat her. I suppose he lifted his head pot day seen her go past, he could come pot except sun down.” “Why?” asked Allister. “I do not know. It nature beast. His eyes could not bear light, I suppose; he could see dark quite well.--One night girl woke suddenly, saw his great head looking her window.” “But could she see dark?” said Allister. “His eyes flashing lighted his head,” answered Kirsty. “But he could not get in!” “No; he could not get in. He looking in, thinking he _should_ like eat her. So morning she told her father. And her father frightened, told her she must never one moment sun down. And long time girl careful. And she need be; creature never made noise, came quiet shadow. One afternoon, however, she gone meet her lover little way glen; stopped talking long, one thing another, sun almost set she bethought herself. She said good-night once, ran home. Now she could reach home without passing pot, she passed pot, she saw last sparkle sun he went down.” “I think she ran!” remarked mouthpiece, Allister. “She run,” said Kirsty, “and got past awful black pot, terrible enough day night without beast it, when--” “But _was_ beast it,” said Allister. “When,” Kirsty went without heeding him, “she heard great _whish_ water behind her. That water tumbling beast’s back he came bottom. If she ran before, she flew now. And worst she could not hear behind her, tell whereabouts he was. He might opening his mouth take her every moment. At last she reached door, her father, gone look her, set wide open she might run once; breath her body, she fell flat she got inside.” Here Allister jumped his seat, clapping his hands crying-- “Then kelpie did not eat her!--Kirsty! Kirsty!” “No. But she fell, one foot left outside threshold, rowan branch could take care it. And beast laid hold foot his great mouth, drag her cottage eat her his leisure.” Here Allister’s face picture behold! His hair almost standing end, his mouth open, his face white paper. “Make haste, Kirsty,” said Turkey, “or Allister go fit.” “But her shoe came his mouth, she drew her foot safe.” Allister’s hair subsided. He drew deep breath, sat again. But Turkey must wise unimaginative Turkey, he broke with-- “I do not believe word it, Kirsty.” “What!” said Kirsty--“do not believe it!” “No. She lost her shoe mud. It wild duck she heard pot, beast her. She never saw it, know.” “She saw look her window.” “Yes, yes. That middle night. I have seen much I waked middle night. I took rat tiger once.” Kirsty looking angry, her needles going even faster she approached climax shoe. “Hold tongue, Turkey,” I said, “and let us hear rest story.” But Kirsty kept her eyes her knitting, resume. “Is all, Kirsty?” said Allister. Still Kirsty returned answer. She needed her force overcome anger she busy stifling. For would never one her position lose her temper unbelieving criticism herd-boy. It curious instance electricity flashed confluence unlike things--the Celtic faith Saxon works. For anger electric flash mind, requires conductor common sense ready hand. After moments she began she never stopped remarks made, her voice trembled little first. “Her father came home soon after, great distress, he found her lying within door. He saw was, his anger kindled her lover beast. Not he objection her going meet him; although he gentleman his daughter shepherd’s daughter, blood MacLeods.” This Kirsty’s clan. And indeed I since discovered original legend her story founded belongs island Rasay, she came. “But he angry gentleman?” asked Allister. “Because he liked her company better he loved herself,” said Kirsty. “At least shepherd said, he ought seen her safe home. But he did not know MacLeod’s father threatened kill ever he spoke girl again.” “But,” said Allister, “I thought Sir Worm Wymble--not Mr. MacLeod.” “Sure, boy, I going tell he got new name him?” returned Kirsty, eagerness showed her fear lest spirit inquiry spread. “He was not Sir Worm Wymble then. His name was--” Here she paused moment, looked full Allister. “His name Allister--Allister MacLeod.” “Allister!” exclaimed brother, repeating name incredible coincidence. “Yes, Allister,” said Kirsty. “There is many Allister, MacLeods, ought do, did not know fear was. And you will another, bonnie Allister, I hope,” she added, stroking boy’s hair. Allister’s face flushed pleasure. It long he asked another question. “Well, I say,” resumed Kirsty, “the father her angry, said she never go meet Allister again. But girl said she ought go let know she could come more; she complaint make Allister; she agreed meet certain day week after; post-office parts. And she meet him, told it. And Allister said nothing much then. But next day he came striding cottage, dinner-time, his claymore (_gladius major_) one side, his dirk other, his little skene dubh (_black knife_) his stocking. And he grand see--such big strong gentleman I And he came striding cottage shepherd sitting his dinner. “‘Angus MacQueen,’ says he, ‘I understand kelpie pot rude Nellie. I going kill him.’ ‘How that, sir?’ said Angus, quite short, he girl’s father. ‘Here is claymore I could put peck,’ said Allister, meaning good steel he could bend round till hilt met point without breaking; ‘and here is shield made hide old Rasay’s black bull; here is dirk made foot half old Andrew Ferrara; here is skene dubh I will drive door, Mr. Angus. And we are fitted, I hope.’ ‘Not all,’ said Angus, I told wise man knowing; ‘not one bit,’ said Angus. ‘The kelpie’s hide thicker three bull-hides, none weapons would mark it.’ ‘What I then, Angus, kill I somehow?’ ‘I will tell do; needs brave man that.’ ‘And think I am brave enough that, Angus?’ ‘I know one thing brave enough for.’ ‘And what is that?’ said Allister, his face grew red, he want anger Nelly’s father. ‘You are brave enough marry girl face clan,’ said Angus. ‘But shall not go way. If Nelly’s good enough talk glen, she is good enough lead hall ladies gentlemen.’ “Then Allister’s face grew redder still, anger, he held his head old man, moments. When he lifted again, pale, fear resolution, he made his mind like gentleman. ‘Mr. Angus MacQueen,’ he said, ‘will give daughter wife?’ ‘If kill kelpie, I will,’ answered Angus; he knew man could would worthy his Nelly.” “But kelpie ate him?” suggested Allister. “Then he would go without girl,” said Kirsty, coolly. “But,” she resumed, “there is always way difficult thing; Allister, gentleman, Angus, shepherd, teach him. “So Angus took Allister pot, began. They tumbled great stones together, set two rows little distance other, making lane rows big enough kelpie walk in. If kelpie heard them, he could see them, took care get cottage dark, could finish preparations one day. And sat night, saw huge head beast looking one window, another, night long. As soon sun up, set work again, finished two rows stones way pot top little hill cottage stood. Then tied cross rowan-tree twigs every stone, beast avenue stones he could get end. And Nelly’s part job. Next gathered quantity furze brushwood peat, piled end avenue next cottage. Then Angus went killed little pig, dressed ready cooking. “‘Now go brother Hamish,’ he said Mr. MacLeod; ‘he is carpenter, know,--and ask lend his longest wimble.’” “What is wimble?” asked little Allister. “A wimble long tool, like great gimlet, cross handle, turn like screw. And Allister ran fetched it, got back half hour sun went down. Then put Nelly cottage, shut door. But I ought told built great heap stones behind brushwood, lighted brushwood, put pig roast fire, laid wimble fire halfway handle. Then laid behind heap stones waited. “By time sun sight, smell roasting pig got avenue side pot, kelpie always got out. He smelt moment he put his head, he thought smelt nice he would go see was. The moment he got he stones, he never thought that, straight way pig. So avenue he came, dark, his big soft web feet made noise, men could see he came light fire. ‘There he is!’ said Allister. ‘Hush!’ said Angus, ‘he hear well enough.’ So beast came on. Now Angus meant he busy pig Allister attack him; Allister thought pity he pig, he put his hand got hold wimble, drew gently fire. And wimble hot white whitest moon ever saw. The pig hot also brute afraid touch it, ever he put his nose Allister thrust wimble his hide, behind left shoulder, boring away his might. The kelpie gave hideous roar, turned away run wimble. But he could get row crossed stones, he turn right round narrow space he could run. Allister, however, could run well kelpie, he hung handle wimble, giving another turn every chance beast went floundering on; he reached his pot wimble reached his heart, kelpie fell dead edge pot. Then went home, pig properly done supper. And Angus gave Nelly Allister, married, lived happily ever after.” “But did not Allister’s father kill him?” “No. He thought better it, did not. He angry while, he got time. And Allister became great man, he done, he called Allister MacLeod more, Sir Worm Wymble. And he died,” concluded Kirsty, “he buried tomb father’s church. And look close enough, you will find wimble carved stone, I am afraid it is worn time.” CHAPTER XI The Kelpie Silence followed close Kirsty’s tale. Wee Davie taken harm, he fast asleep his head her bosom. Allister staring fire, fancying he saw whorls wimble heating it. Turkey cutting his stick blunt pocket-knife, silent whistle his puckered lips. I sorry story over, growing stupid reaction excitement. I was, however, meditating strict search wimble carved knight’s tomb. All came sound latch lifted vain, followed thundering outer door, Kirsty prudently locked. Allister, Turkey, I started feet, Allister cry dismay, Turkey grasping his stick. “It is kelpie!” cried Allister. But harsh voice old witch followed, something deadened intervening door. “Kirsty! Kirsty!” cried; “open door directly.” “No, no, Kirsty!” I objected. “She will shake wee Davie bits, haul Allister snow. She is afraid touch me.” Turkey thrust poker fire; Kirsty snatched out, threw down, boxed his ears, rough proceeding he took pleasantest laugh world. Kirsty could she pleased, she tyrant. She turned us. “Hush!” she said, hurriedly, twinkle her eyes showed spirit fun predominant--“Hush!--Do not speak, wee Davie,” she continued, she rose carried kitchen passage outer door. He scarcely awake. Now, passage, wide, indeed like hall proportion cottage, stood end time immemorial huge barrel, Kirsty, housewifely intent other, lately cleaned out. Setting Davie down, she Turkey lifted first popped it, Allister, caught design once. Finally she took wee Davie, telling lie still mouse, dropped arms. I happened find open bung-hole near eye, peeped out. The knocking continued. “Wait bit, Mrs. Mitchell,” screamed Kirsty; “wait till I get potatoes fire.” As she spoke, she took great bow-pot one hand carried door, pour away water. When she unlocked opened door, I saw bung-hole lovely sight; moon shining, snow falling thick. In midst stood Mrs. Mitchell, one mass whiteness. She would rushed in, Kirsty’s advance pot made her give way, behind Kirsty Turkey slipped round corner without seen. There he stood watching, busy time kneading snowballs. “And may please want to-night, Mrs. Mitchell?” said Kirsty, great civility. “What I want poor children? They ought bed hour ago. Really, Kirsty, ought sense years encourage goings on.” “At years!” returned Kirsty, give sharp retort, checked herself, saying, “Are not bed then, Mrs. Mitchell?” “You know well enough not.” “Poor things! I would recommend put bed once.” “So I will. Where they?” “Find yourself, Mrs. Mitchell. You better ask civil tongue help you. I am going it.” They standing inside door. Mrs. Mitchell advanced. I trembled. It seemed impossible she see well I saw her. I vague impression looking her I draw her eyes upon me; I could withdraw mine bung-hole. I fascinated; nearer she came, less could I keep watching her. When she turned kitchen, great relief; last long, she came moment, searching like hound. She taller Kirsty, standing her tiptoes could looked right barrel. She approaching intent--those eyes overshadow us baleful light. Already her apron hid vision one eye, whizz, dull blow, shriek Mrs. Mitchell came ears together. The next moment, field vision open, I saw Mrs. Mitchell holding her head hands, face Turkey grinning round corner open door. Evidently he wanted entice her follow him; she much astonished snowball back her neck even look direction whence blow come. So Turkey stepped out, poising delivery second missile, she turned sharp round. The snowball missed her, came great bang barrel. Wee Davie gave cry alarm, danger now, Mrs. Mitchell Turkey. In moment, Kirsty lowered barrel side, crept out. I wee Davie back instantly, Kirsty caught Allister, manse. As soon yard, however, met Turkey, breathless. He given Mrs. Mitchell slip, left her searching barn him. He took Allister Kirsty, sped away, downhill now. When Mrs. Mitchell got back farmhouse, Kirsty busy nothing happened, when, fruitless search, she returned manse, snug bed, door locked. After passed school, Mrs. Mitchell dare make disturbance. From night she always went name _the Kelpie_. CHAPTER XII Another Kelpie In summer slept large room wide sloping roof. It dormer window, great distance eaves. One day something ivy, covered gable half front house, ladder using left leaning back. It reached little eaves, right dormer window. That night I could sleep, unfrequently case me. On occasions I used go wandering upper part house. I believe servants thought I walked sleep, so, I always knew I well enough. I remember whether began dreadful night I woke barn, I think enjoyment gave rooted starry loneliness I found myself. I wonder I explain feelings. The pleasure arose sort sense protected danger. On memorable night, I naked silence, alone vast universe, kept looking full something knew would speak. Now, wandering sleepless, I could gaze nest safety upon beautiful fear. From window window I would go middle night, staring blank darkness came, signs being, raindrops bespattered hailstones berattled panes; gazing deeps blue vault, gold-bespangled worlds; or, again, mysteries soft clouds, gathered opal tent centre-clasp moon, thinking her light shining shadowy folds. This, I said, one nights I could sleep. It summer winter-story kelpie, I believe; past confused, chronology worthless, continuous _now_ childhood. The night hot; little brothers sleeping loud, wee Davie called _snoring_; great moth got within curtains somewhere, kept fluttering whirring. I got up, went window. It night! The moon full, rather low, looked she thinking--“Nobody heeding me: I may well go bed.” All top sky covered mackerel-backed clouds, lying like milky ripples blue sea, stars shot, there, sharp little rays like sparkling diamonds. There awfulness it, night gulfy sky stood me, flashing heavenly host, nothing farthest world. The clouds like veil hid terrible light Holy Holies--a curtain God’s love, dim loveliness grandeur being, make his children able bear it. My eye fell upon top rounds ladder, rose edge roof like invitation. I opened window, crept through, and, holding ledge, let slates, feeling feet top ladder. In moment I upon it. Down I went, oh, tender bare feet cool grass I alighted! I looked up. The dark housewall rose me. I could ascend I pleased. There hurry. I would walk little. I would put place refuge yet little farther off, nibble danger, were--a danger existed imagination. I went outside high holly hedge, house hidden. A grassy field me, beyond field rose farm buildings. Why I run across wake Turkey? I like shot, expectation companion delight overcoming remnants lingering apprehension. I knew one bolt, manageable one, Turkey, he slept little wooden chamber partitioned loft barn, he climb ladder. The fearful part crossing barn-floor. But I man enough that. I reached crossed yard safety, searched found key barn, always left hole wall door,--turned lock, crossed floor fast darkness would allow me. With outstretched groping hands I found ladder, ascended, stood Turkey’s bed. “Turkey! Turkey! wake up,” I cried. “It is beautiful night! It is shame lie sleeping way.” Turkey’s answer immediate. He wide awake bed his wits moment. “Sh! sh!” he said, “or you will wake Oscar.” Oscar colley (_sheep dog_) slept kennel cornyard. He much watch-dog, great occasion watching, he knew it, slept like human child; he knowing dogs. Turkey proceeding dress. “Never mind clothes, Turkey,” I said. “There is nobody up.” Willing enough spare trouble, Turkey followed his shirt. But cornyard, instead finding contentment sky moon, I did, he wanted know going do. “It is bad sort night,” he said; “what shall it?” He always wanting something. “Oh, nothing,” I answered; “only look us bit.” “You did not hear robbers, you?” he asked. “Oh dear, no! I could not sleep, got ladder, came wake you--that is all.” “Let us walk, then,” he said. Now I Turkey, scarcely terror night day. I consented once. That shoes least consequence Scotch boys. I often, Turkey always, went barefooted summer. As left barn, Turkey caught his little whip. He never seen without either his club, called stick he carried he herding cattle. Finding thus armed, I begged give his club. He ran fetched it, and, thus equipped, set nowhere middle night. My fancy full fragmentary notions adventure, shadows The Pilgrim’s Progress predominated. I shouldered club, trying persuade imagination unchristian weapon pagan giant, therefore unfittingly carried. But Turkey far better armed his lash wire I club. His little whip like fearful weapon called morning star hand stalwart knight. We took way towards nearest hills, thinking little went motion. I guess story I related must, notwithstanding his unbelief, working Turkey’s brain night, walked mile along road, arrived foot wooded hill, well known children neighbourhood bilberries, he turned hollow broken track, lost field yet half-redeemed moorland. It plain Turkey goal his view; I followed his leading, asked questions. All he stopped, said, pointing yards front him: “Look, Ranald!” I look, moon behind hill, night dim I keep looking several moments ere I discovered he pointing dull gleam dark water. Very horrible seemed. I felt flesh creep instant I saw it. It lay hollow left digging peats, drained thither surrounding bog. My heart sank fear. The almost black glimmer surface bad enough, could tell lay unknown depth? But, I gazed, almost paralysed, huge dark figure rose opposite side pool. For one moment scepticism Turkey seemed fail him, he cried out, “The kelpie! The kelpie!” turned ran. I followed fast feet utterly unconscious ground trod upon could bear me. We gone many yards great roar filled silent air. That moment Turkey slackened his pace, burst fit laughter. “It is nothing Bogbonny’s bull, Ranald!” he cried. Kelpies unknown creatures Turkey, bull dog sheep, domestic animal. I, however, share his equanimity, never slackened pace till I got him. “But he is rather ill-natured,” he went on, instant I joined him, “and better make hill.” Another roar fresh spur speed. We could better trim running. But uphill, ground distance us animal boggy, he go round good way, one us least would evil case. “He is caught sight shirts,” said Turkey, panting he ran, “and he wants see are. But we will fence he comes us. I would not mind myself; I could dodge well enough; he might go you, Ranald.” What fear exertion I unable reply. Another bellow sounded nearer, could hear dull stroke his hoofs soft ground he galloped us. But fence dry stones, larch wood within it, close hand. “Over you, Ranald!” cried Turkey, his last breath; turned bay, brute close behind him. But I spent, I could climb wall; I saw Turkey turn face bull, I turned too. We shadow hill, I could see Turkey lift his arm. A short sharp hiss, roar followed. The bull tossed his head pain, left Turkey, came towards me. He could charge great speed, ground steep uneven. I, too, kept hold weapon; although I dreadfully frightened, I felt courage rise Turkey’s success, lifted club hope might prove good need Turkey’s whip. It well me, however, Turkey quick bull. He got me, second stinging cut brass wire drew second roar his throat, doubt second red streamlet his nose, club descended one his horns bang jarred arm elbow, sent weapon flying fence. The animal turned tail moment--long enough place us, enlivened success, side wall, crouched he could see us. Turkey, however, kept looking line wall sky; he looked, came nose bull, within yard his head. Hiss went little whip, bellow went bull. “Get among trees, Ranald, fear he come over,” said Turkey, whisper. I obeyed. But he could see nothing his foes, animal enough it, heard him. After while, Turkey left his lair joined me. We rested little, would clambered top hill, gave attempt awkward getting furze bush. In condition, dark. I began grow sleepy, also, thought I like exchange hillside bed. Turkey made objection, trudged home again; without sundry starts quick glances make sure bull neither us road, watching us behind bush hillock. Turkey never left till he saw safe ladder; nay, I bed, I spied his face peeping window topmost round it. By time east begun begin glow, Allister, painfully exact, would said; I fairly tired now, and, falling asleep once, never woke Mrs. Mitchell pulled clothes me, indignity I keenly felt, yet know render impossible future. CHAPTER XIII Wandering Willie At time good many beggars going country, lived upon alms charitable. Among half-witted persons, who, although relied upon, seldom extent mischievous. We much afraid them, home-neighbourhood charmed spot round drawn magic circle safety, seldom roamed far beyond it. There was, however, one occasional visitor class, stood degree awe. He commonly styled Foolish Willie. His approach manse always announced wailful strain upon bagpipes, set he inherited his father, piper Highland nobleman: least said. Willie never went without his pipes, attached living creature. He played well, too, though corner he kept amount intellect necessary mastery puzzle. The probability seemed his wits decayed he become measure proficient use chanter, call pipe means whose perforations notes regulated. However may be, Willie could certainly play pipes, great favourite it--with children especially, notwithstanding mixture fear his presence always occasioned them. Whether Highland blood Kirsty’s stories, I know, always delighted far-off sound his pipes reached us: little Davie would dance shout glee. Even Kelpie, Mrs. Mitchell is, benignantly inclined towards Wandering Willie, people called old song; much Turkey, always tried account things, declared his conviction Willie must Mrs. Mitchell’s brother, she ashamed would not him. I believe he smallest atom corroboration conjecture, therefore bold worthy inventor. One thing knew, she would ostentatiously fill canvas bag he carried his side, broken scraps she could gather, would give much milk drink he pleased, would speak kind, almost coaxing, words poor _natural_--words sounded stranger ears, quite unused like sounds lips Kelpie. It impossible describe Willie’s dress: agglomeration ill-supplied necessity superfluous whim never exceeded. His pleasure pin his person whatever gay-coloured cotton handkerchiefs he could get hold of; that, one behind one before, spread across back chest, he always looked like ancient herald come message knight nobleman. So incongruous his costume I could never tell whether kilt trousers original foundation upon constructed. To his tatters add bits old ribbon, list, coloured rag he attached his pipes wherever room, see he looked flags pennons--a moving grove raggery, came screaming chant drone his instrument. When he danced, he like whirlwind caught contents old-clothes-shop. It wonder he produced minds indescribable mixture awe delight--awe, one could tell he might next, delight his oddity, agility, music. The first sensation always slight fear, gradually wore became anew accustomed strangeness apparition. Before visit over, wee Davie would playing dangles his pipes, laying his ear bag he thought music came ready-made. And Willie particularly fond Davie, tried make agreeable hundred grotesque fashions. The awe, however, constantly renewed his absence, partly threats Kelpie, that, so, she would give one Foolish Willie take away him--a threat fell almost powerless upon me, still told upon Allister Davie. One day, early summer--it I begun go school--I came home usual five of the clock, find manse great commotion. Wee Davie disappeared. They looking everywhere without avail. Already farmhouses thoroughly searched. An awful horror fell upon me, frightful ideas Davie’s fate arose mind. I remember giving howl dismay moment I heard catastrophe, I received sound box ear Mrs. Mitchell. I miserable, however, show active resentment, sat upon grass cried. In minutes, father, away visiting his parishioners, rode his little black mare. Mrs. Mitchell hurried meet him, wringing her hands, crying-- “Oh, sir! oh, sir! Davie’s away Foolish Willie!” This first I heard Willie connection affair. My father turned pale, kept perfectly quiet. “Which way he go?” he asked. Nobody knew. “How long ago?” “About hour half, I think,” said Mrs. Mitchell. To news relief. Now I could least something. I left group, hurried away find Turkey. Except father, I trusted Turkey anyone. I got rising ground near manse, looked I found cattle feeding afternoon, darted full speed. They distance home, I found Turkey heard nothing mishap. When I succeeded conveying dreadful news, he shouldered his club, said-- “The cows must look themselves, Ranald!” With words he set good swinging trot direction little rocky knoll hollow half mile away, he knew favourite haunt Wandering Willie, often he came neighbourhood. On knoll grew stunted trees, gnarled old, mossy stems. There moss stones too, grew lovely harebells, foot knoll always season tall foxgloves, imparted certain fear spot fancy. For call _Dead Man’s Bells_, I thought murdered man buried somewhere thereabout. I liked alone even broad daylight. But Turkey I would gone hour, even without impulse urged follow best speed. There marshy ground us knoll, floundered it; Turkey, distance ahead me, dropped walk, began reconnoitre knoll caution. I soon got him. “He is there, Ranald!” he said. “Who? Davie?” “I do not know Davie; Willie’s there.” “How know?” “I heard his bagpipes grunt. Perhaps Davie sat upon them.” “Oh, run, Turkey!” I said, eagerly. “No hurry,” he returned. “If Willie him, he will not hurt him, may not easy get away. We must creep see done.” Half dead trees were, foliage enough upon hide Willie, Turkey hoped would help hide approach. He went his hands knees, thus crept towards knoll, skirting partly, little way round steeper. I followed his example, found I his match crawling four-footed fashion. When reached steep side, lay still listened. “He is there!” I cried whisper. “Sh!” said Turkey; “I hear him. It is right. We will soon hold him.” A weary whimper child worn hopeless crying reached ears. Turkey immediately began climb side knoll. “Stay are, Ranald,” he said. “I go quieter you.” I obeyed. Cautious deer-stalker, he ascended, still his hands knees. I strained eyes his every motion. But he near top he lay perfectly quiet, continued till I could bear longer, crept him. When I came behind him, he looked round angrily, made emphatic contortion his face; I dared climb level him, lay trembling expectation. The next moment I heard call low whisper: “Davie! Davie! wee Davie!” But reply. He called little louder, evidently trying reach degrees pitch would pierce Davie’s ears arrive Wandering Willie’s, I rightly presumed farther off. His tones grew louder louder--but yet risen sharp whisper, length small trembling voice cried “Turkey! Turkey!” prolonged accents mingled hope pain. There sound bushes me--a louder sound rush. Turkey sprang his feet vanished. I followed. Before I reached top, came despairing cry Davie, shout gabble Willie. Then followed louder shout louder gabble, mixed scream bagpipes, exulting laugh Turkey. All passed moment I spent getting top, last step difficult. There Davie alone thicket, Turkey scudding opposite slope bagpipes his arm, Wandering Willie pursuing foaming fury. I caught Davie arms he lay sobbing crying “Yanal! Yanal!” stood moment knowing do, resolved fight teeth nails Willie take again. Meantime Turkey led Willie towards deepest boggy ground, soon floundering, Turkey, lighter, advantage. When I saw that, I resolved make home. I got Davie back, slid farther side skirt bog, I knew I stick Davie’s weight added own. I gone far, however, howl Willie made aware he caught sight us; looking round, I saw turn Turkey come us. Presently, however, he hesitated, stopped, began looking way one his treasures, evil hands. Doubtless his indecision would ludicrous anyone stake turn scale. As was, he made his mind far soon, he chose follow Davie. I ran best strength despair distance, but, seeing soon I chance, I set Davie down, telling keep behind me, prepared, like Knight Red Cross, “sad battle darrayne”. Willie came fury, his rags fluttering like ten scarecrows, he waving his arms air, wild gestures grimaces cries curses. He terrible bull, Turkey behind him. I just, like negro, preparing run head pit his stomach, upset I could, I saw Turkey running towards us full speed, blowing bagpipes he ran. How he found breath I cannot understand. At length, he put bag his arm, forth issued combination screeching grunting howling, Wandering Willie, full career his rage, turned cries his companion. Then came Turkey’s masterpiece. He dashed bagpipes ground, commenced kicking like football, pipes cried every kick. If Turkey’s first object utter demolition, he could treated unmercifully. It time gentle measures: life hung balance. But Willie could bear. He turned us, pursued his pipes. When he nearly overtaken him, Turkey gave last masterly kick, sent flying air, caught fell, sought bog, I, hoisting Davie back, hurried, haste speed, towards manse. What took place I left them, I Turkey’s report, I never looked behind till I reached little green house, where, setting Davie down, I threw grass. I remember nothing till I came bed. When Turkey reached bog, got Wandering Willie well middle it, he threw bagpipes far beyond he could, made his way out. Willie followed pipes, took them, held sky appealing heaven cruelty, sat middle bog upon solitary hump, cried like child. Turkey stood watched him, first feelings triumph, slow degrees cooled length passed compassion, he grew heartily sorry poor fellow, although room repentance. After Willie cried while, he took instrument mangled corpse his son, proceeded examine it. Turkey declared his certainty none pipes broken; length Willie put mouthpiece his lips, began blow bag, alas! would hold wind. He flung anger cried again. Turkey left crying middle bog. He said pitiful sight. It long Willie appeared part country again; but, six months after, neighbours fair twenty miles off, told father seen looking much usual, playing his pipes energy ever. This great relief father, could bear idea poor fellow’s loneliness without his pipes, wanted much get repaired him. But ever father showed great regard Turkey. I heard say that, he chance, Turkey would made great general. That he judged capable much, surprising me; yet he became consequence still greater eyes. When I set Davie down, fell grass, nobody near. Everyone engaged new search Davie. My father rode without dismounting, inquire neighbouring toll-gate whether Willie passed through. It likely, wanderers seldom take hard high road; he could think nothing else, better something. Having failed there, he returned ridden along country road passed farm towards hills, leaving Willie Davie far behind him. It twilight he returned. How long, therefore, I lay upon grass, I know. When I came myself, I found sharp pain side. Turn I would, was, I could draw short breath it. I father’s bed, one room. I lay time increasing pain; little father came in, I felt be. Seeing awake, he approached anxious face. “Is Davie right, father?” I asked. “He quite well, Ranald, boy. How feel now?” “I have asleep, father?” “Yes; found grass, Davie pulling trying wake you, crying, ‘Yanal will not peak me. Yanal! Yanal!’ I afraid terrible run him. Turkey, call him, told it. He is fine lad Turkey!” “Indeed he is, father!” I cried gasp betrayed suffering. “What matter, boy?” he asked. “Lift little, please,” I said, “I _such_ pain side!” “Ah!” he said, “it catches breath. We must send old doctor.” The old doctor sort demigod place. Everybody believed trusted him; nobody could die peace without without father. I delighted thought his patient. I think I see standing his back fire, taking his lancet his pocket, preparations made bleeding arm, far commoner operation now. That night I delirious, haunted bagpipes. Wandering Willie nowhere, atmosphere full bagpipes. It unremitting storm bagpipes--silent, assailing bodily quarters--now small motes sun, hailing upon me; large feather-beds, ready bang us about, never touched us; huge Mount Ætna, threatening smother us beneath ponderous bulk; time I toiling little Davie back. Next day I little better, weak, many days I able get bed. My father soon found would let Mrs. Mitchell attend upon me, I always worse she room time; he got another woman take Kirsty’s duties, set her nurse me, illness became almost luxury. With Kirsty near, nothing could go wrong. And growing better pure enjoyment. Once, Kirsty absent little while, Mrs. Mitchell brought gruel. “The gruel’s nice,” I said. “It is perfectly good, Ranald, there is merit complaining everybody’s trying make comfortable can,” said Kelpie. “Let taste it,” said Kirsty, moment entered room.--“It is fit anybody eat,” she said, carried away, Mrs. Mitchell following her her nose horizontal. Kirsty brought basin back full delicious gruel, well boiled, supplemented cream. I sure way she transformed basin gruel lesson ever since quality work I did. No boy girl much better lesson than--to must done well done. Everything, commonest, well done, something progress world; is, lessens, smallest hair’s-breadth, distance God. Oh, delight first glowing summer afternoon upon I carried field Turkey herding cattle! I could yet walk. That morning, I dressed Kirsty, I insisted I could walk quite well, Kirsty over-persuaded letting try. Not feeling steady legs, I set running, tumbled knees first chair I came near. I light wasting illness, Kirsty herself, little woman she was, able carry me. I remember well I saw everything double day, found first amusing. Kirsty set plaid grass, next moment, Turkey, looking awfully big, portentously healthy, stood side. I wish I might give conversation dialect native country, loses much translation; I promised, I keep promise. “Eh, Ranald!” said Turkey, “it is yourself?” “It is me, Turkey,” I said, nearly crying pleasure. “Never mind, Ranald,” he returned, consoling disappointment; “we will rare fun yet.” “I am frightened cows, Turkey. Do not let come near me.” “No, I will not,” answered Turkey, brandishing his club give confidence, “_I_‘ll give them, look ugly horns.” “Turkey,” I said, I often pondered matter illness, “how Hawkie behave away me--that day, know?” “She ate half rick green corn,” answered Turkey, coolly. “But she worst it. They make hole her side, she would died. There she turnips!” He her shout flourish. Hawkie heard obeyed, turning round her hind-legs sudden start, she knew his voice he dangerously energetic mood. “You will right soon,” he said, coming quietly back me. Kirsty gone farmhouse, leaving injunctions Turkey concerning me. “Oh yes, I am nearly well now; I cannot walk yet.” “Will come back?” he said. When Kirsty returned take home, I following cows Turkey’s back, riding wherever I chose; horse obedient dog, horse, servant love be. From day I recovered rapidly. CHAPTER XIV Elsie Duff How boys girls stared me, timidly, yet sense importance derived distinction ill, I entered parish school one morning, ten of the clock! For I said before, I gone school months I taken ill. It different affair Dame Shand’s tyrannical little kingdom. Here boys ages, girls likewise, ruled energetic young man, touch genius, manifested chiefly enthusiasm teaching. He spoken kindly first day I went, secured attachment never wavered, even when, once, supposing guilty certain breach orders committed next neighbour, he called up, and, severity usual, ordered hold hand. The lash stung dreadfully, I able smile his face notwithstanding. I could done I guilty. He dropped his hand, already lifted second blow, sent back seat. I suppose either his heart interfered, he saw I need punishment. The greatest good he me, one I shall ever grateful, rousing love English literature, especially poetry. But I cannot linger upon present, tempting although be. I led busy life world since, one greatest comforts work day over--dry work I do--to return books, live company greater myself, higher work life mine. The master used say man fit company man he could understand, therefore I hope often day, future condition existence, I may look upon faces Milton Bacon Shakspere, whose writings given much strength hope throughout life here. The moment he saw me, master came took hand, saying he glad see able come school again. “You must try much first,” he added. This set mettle, I worked hard success. But morning I grew tired, fell fast asleep head desk. I informed afterwards master interfered one class-fellows trying wake me, told let sleep. When one of the clock came, I roused noise dismissal two hours dinner. I staggered out, still stupid sleep, I find watching door-post Turkey! “Turkey!” I exclaimed; “you here!” “Yes, Ranald,” he said; “I have put cows hour two, hot; Kirsty said I might come carry home.” So saying he stooped me, took his strong back. As soon I well settled, he turned his head, said: “Ranald, I like go look mother. Will come? There is plenty time.” “Yes, please, Turkey,” I answered. “I have never seen mother.” He set slow easy trot, bore street lane arrived two-storey house, roof his mother lived. She widow, Turkey. What curious place her little garret was! The roof sloped one side floor, little window it, I could see away manse, mile off, far beyond it. Her bed stood one corner, check curtain hung rafter front it. In another chest, contained spare clothes, including Turkey’s best garments, he went home put every Sunday morning. In little grate smouldered fire oak-bark, astringent virtue extracted pits lanyard, given poor nothing. Turkey’s mother sitting near little window, spinning. She spare, thin, sad-looking woman, loving eyes slow speech. “Johnnie!” she exclaimed, “what brings here? who is you have brought you?” Instead stopping her work she spoke, she made her wheel go faster before; I gazed admiration her deft fingering wool, thread flowed continuous line, something plastic, towards revolving spool. “It is Ranald Bannerman,” said Turkey quietly. “I am his horse. I am taking home school. This first time he is since he ill.” Hearing this, she relaxed her labour, hooks revolving fast invisible mist motion, began dawn form, length revealed shape, last stood quite still. She rose, said: “Come, Master Ranald, sit down. You will tired riding rough horse that.” “No, indeed,” I said; “Turkey rough horse; he is best horse world.” “He always calls Turkey, mother, nose,” said Turkey, laughing. “And brings here?” asked his mother. “This road manse.” “I wanted see better, mother.” “But becomes cows?” “Oh! they are safe enough. They know I am here.” “Well, sit rest both,” she said, resuming her place wheel. “I am glad see you, Johnnie, work neglected. I must go mine.” Thereupon Turkey, stood waiting his mother’s will, deposited upon her bed, sat beside me. “And how is papa, good man?” she said me. I told her he quite well. “All better you are restored grave, I do not doubt,” she said. I never known I danger. “It is sore time too,” she added. “You must good son him, Ranald, he great way you, tell me.” Turkey said nothing, I much surprised know say; often father come room, he always looked cheerful, I idea he uneasy me. After little talk, Turkey rose, said must going. “Well, Ranald,” said his mother, “you must come see time you are tired school, lie rest bit. Be good lad, Johnnie, mind work.” “Yes, mother, I will try,” answered Turkey cheerfully, he hoisted upon his back. “Good day, mother,” he added, left room. I mention little incident led things afterwards. I rode home upon Turkey’s back; father’s leave, instead returning school day, spent afternoon fields Turkey. In middle field cattle day, large circular mound. I often thought since must barrow, dead men’s bones heart it, suspicion crossed mind. Its sides rather steep, covered lovely grass. On side farthest manse, without one human dwelling sight, Turkey I lay afternoon, bliss enhanced me, I afraid, contrasted thought close, hot, dusty schoolroom, class-fellows talking, laughing, wrangling, perhaps trying work spite difficulties after-dinner disinclination. A fitful little breeze, subject influence heat, would wake moments, wave heads horse-daisies, waft strains odour blossoms white clover, die away fatigued effort. Turkey took his Jews’ harp, discoursed soothing eloquent strains. At feet, yards mound, ran babbling brook, divided farm next. Those readers whose ears open music Nature, must observed different songs sung different brooks. Some mere tinkling, others sweet silver bells, tone besides bell ever had. Some sing careless, defiant tone. This one sung veiled voice, contralto muffled hollows overhanging banks, low, deep, musical gurgle stony eddies, straw would float days nights till flood came, borne round round funnel-hearted whirlpool. The brook deep size, good deal say solemn tone small stream. We lay side hillock, I say, Turkey’s Jews’ harp mingled sounds brook. After he laid aside, silent time. At length Turkey spoke. “You have seen mother, Ranald.” “Yes, Turkey.” “She is I have got look after.” “I have not got mother look after, Turkey.” “No. You have father look you. I must it, know. My father was not good mother. He used get drunk sometimes, he rough her. I must make her well I can. She is well off, Ranald.” “Is not she, Turkey?” “No. She works hard her spinning, one spins better mother. How could they? But it is poor pay, know, she will getting old by.” “Not to-morrow, Turkey.” “No, to-morrow, day after,” said Turkey, looking surprise see I meant remark. He discovered eyes led thoughts astray, he saying his mother got farther ears. For opposite side stream, grass, like shepherdess old picture, sat young girl, age, midst crowded colony daisies white clover, knitting her needles went fast Kirsty’s, nearly invisible thing hooked teeth looked dangerous ran sight upon Turkey’s mother’s spinning-wheel. A little way her fine cow feeding, long iron chain dragging her. The girl far see her face distinctly; something her shape, her posture, hang her head, I know what, attracted me. “Oh! there is Elsie Duff,” said Turkey, forgetting his mother sight--“with her granny’s cow! I did not know she coming to-day.” “How it,” I asked, “that she feeding her old James Joss’s land?” “Oh! they are good Elsie, see. Nobody cares much her grandmother; Elsie’s her grandmother, although cow belongs old woman, yet Elsie’s sake, one one gives her bite it--that is day’s feed generally. If look cow, you will see she is like one feeds roadsides. She is plump needful, good udderful milk besides.” “I will run tell her she may bring cow field to-morrow,” I said, rising. “I would _mine_” said Turkey, marked tone, I understood. “Oh! I see, Turkey,” I said. “You mean I ought ask father.” “Yes, sure, I mean that,” answered Turkey. “Then it is good done,” I returned. “I ask to-night.” “She is good girl, Elsie,” Turkey’s reply. How happened I cannot remember, I know that, all, I ask father, Granny Gregson’s cow bite either glebe farm. And Turkey’s reflections concerning mother he take care interrupted, end moving remained present unuttered. I soon grew quite strong again, neither plea desire exemption school labours. My father also begun take hand well brother Tom; arithmetic Latin together, mention geography history, I quite enough do, quite much also good me. CHAPTER XV A New Companion During summer, I made acquaintance school boy called Peter Mason. Peter clever boy, whose merry eye sparkle always ready break. He seldom knew his lesson well, but, _kept in_ knowing it, always learned rest got half through. Amongst his standing he acknowledged leader playground, besides often invited take share amusements older boys, he petted his cleverness obliging disposition. Beyond school hours, he spent his time manner pranks. In hot summer weather he would bathe twenty times day, much home water dabchick. And I came good me. There small river far father’s house, certain point dammed back weir large stones turn part aside mill-race. The mill stood little way down, steep bank. It almost surrounded trees, willows water’s edge, birches larches bank. Above dam fine spot bathing, could get depth liked--from two feet five six; boys village bathed, I them. I cannot recall memory summer days without gush delight gurgling heart, water used gurgle stones dam. It quiet place, particularly side father’s farm went down, sheltered little wood farther surrounded mill. The field bordered river kept natural grass, thick short fine, bank grew well, although grass common part country: upon parts farm, grass sown every year along corn. Oh summer days, hot sun drawing odours feathery larches white-stemmed birches, when, getting water, I would lie warm soft grass, tenderest little breeze would creep skin, sun baking pleasant, I would rouse effort, running fringe rushes bordered full-brimmed river, plunge headlong quiet brown water, dabble swim till I weary! For innocent animal delight, I know nothing match days--so warm, yet pure-aired--so clean, glad. I often think God must love his little children invented delights! For, course, he love children delight pleasure, he would invented two brought together. Yes, child, I know would say,--“How many pleasures!” I grant sorrowfully; must remember God done yet; and, besides, pleasures world I know anything about. And _all_ pleasure, I know I care much better, I would rather made good pleasure world; would you, though perhaps know yet. One day, good many us water together. I somebody amongst estimation I bathed father’s ground, piece bank side regarded common village. Suddenly upon latter spot, undressed, already water, appeared man lately rented property part, accompanied dog, flesh-coloured nose villainous look--a mongrel bull predominated. He ordered everyone his premises. Invaded terror, all, except big boy trusted dog would frightened his naked figure he dog, plunged river, swam waded inhospitable shore. Once embrace stream, thoughtlessly turned mocked enemy, forgetting much still his power. Indignant tyrant, I stood “limpid wave”, assured aquatic company welcome opposite bank. So far well. But clothes! They, alas! upon bank left! The spirit host upon me, I regarded guests. “You come ashore like,” I said; “I see done clothes.” I knew dam lay little boat built miller’s sons. It clumsy enough, eyes marvel engineering art. On opposite side stood big boy braving low-bred cur barked growled ugly head stretched like serpent’s; his owner, probably unkind thought him, stood enjoying fun all. Reckoning upon big boy’s assistance, I scrambled water, sped, like Achilles swift foot, boat. I jumped seized oars, intending row across, get big boy throw clothes party boat. But I never handled oar life, middle passage--how happened I cannot tell--I found floundering water. Now, although might expect water dammed back here, would shallow dam, opposite. Had bottom hard, would shallow; bottom soft muddy, rush water dam winter-floods made great hollow. There besides another weir little way dammed water back; depth greater almost part within ken village boys. Indeed horrors afloat concerning depth. I poor swimmer, swimming natural gift, equally distributed all. I might done better, however, stories awful gulf beneath me. I struggling floundering, half-blind, quite deaf, sense water constantly getting stopping me, whatever I wanted do, I felt laid hold leg, dragged water, moment landed safe bank. Almost moment I heard plunge, getting up, staggering bewildered, saw, haze dream, boy swimming boat, gone slow current. I saw overtake it, scramble midstream, handle oars manner born. When he brought back spot I stood, I knew Peter Mason deliverer. Quite recovered time slight attack drowning, I got boat, leaving oars Peter, rowed across landed. There difficulty. The man, alarmed, I suppose, danger I run, recalled his dog; bundled clothes; Peter rowed across; Rory, big boy, took water boat, I plunged dam. For whole summer part following winter, Peter hero, forgetting even friend Turkey. I took every opportunity joining his games, partly gratitude, partly admiration, either simple human attraction boy. It time he led real mischief, came last. CHAPTER XVI I Go Down Hill It came following winter. My father begun teach well Tom, I confess I value privilege. I got much fond society Peter Mason, time I could command I spent him. Always full questionable frolic, spirit mischief gathered dark nights drew on. The sun, wind, green fields, flowing waters summer kept within bounds; ice snow came, sky grey one cloud, wind full needle-points frost ground hard stone, evenings dark, sun noon shone low far away south, demon mischief awoke bosom Peter Mason, and, winter, I ashamed say, drew also net. Nothing bad result incident I relate. There must been, however, gradual declension towards it, although pain followed upon almost obliterated recollection preceding follies. Nobody anything bad once. Wickedness needs apprenticeship well difficult trades. It January, long shortest day, sun setting half-past three of the clock. At three school over, coming out, Peter whispered me, one his merriest twinkles his eyes: “Come across dark, Ranald, we will fun.” I promised, arranged meet. It Friday, I Latin prepare Saturday, therefore father want me. I remember feeling jolly I went home dinner, made sun set ten times least, running earthen wall parted fields road; often I ran I saw shoulder hill, behind he going down. When I dinner, I impatient join Peter Mason I could rest, idleness began tease wee Davie. A great deal nasty teasing, common among boys, comes idleness. Poor Davie began cry last, I, getting wicked, went teasing him, length he burst howl wrath misery, whereupon Kelpie, tenderness him, burst room, boxed ears soundly. I fury rage revenge, I near anything I could caught up, something serious would result. In spite resistance, she pushed room locked door. I would complained father, I perfectly aware that, although _she_ right strike me, I deserved chastisement behaviour brother. I still boiling anger I set village join Mason. I mention show I bad state mind, thus prepared wickedness followed. I repeat, boy never disgraces once. He tumble top bottom cellar stair. He goes steps till he comes broken one, he goes bottom rush. It also serve show enmity Mrs. Mitchell nowise abated, however excusable she might case mentioned, she remained evil element household. When I reached village, I found people about. The night cold, black frost. There thaw day carried away snow, corners lay remnants dirty heaps swept there. I waiting near one these, happened spot Peter arranged meet me, little shop near girl came walked quickly street. I yielded temptation arising mind grown darkness slimy things crawling it. I kicked hole frozen crust heap, scraped handful dirty snow, kneaded snowball, sent girl. It struck her back head. She gave cry ran away, her hand her forehead. Brute I was, I actually laughed. I think I must nearer devil I since. At least I hope so. For see worse-trained boys. I knew quite well I wrong, refused think it. I felt bad inside. Peter might done thing without half wicked I was. He feel wickedness kind thing I did. He would laughed merrily. But vile dregs wrath Kelpie fermenting bosom, horrid pleasure I found annoying innocent girl wicked Kelpie made angry, could never expressed merry laugh like Mason’s. The fact is, I displeased anybody else, though I allow it, would take trouble repent right thing. If I even said wee Davie I sorry, I think I done wicked things followed; means. In little Peter joined me. He laughed, course, I told girl run like frighted hare, poor fun his eyes. “Look here, Ranald,” he said, holding something like piece wood. “What it, Peter?” I asked. “It is stalk cabbage,” he answered. “I have scooped inside filled tow. We will set fire one end, blow smoke keyhole.” “Whose keyhole, Peter?” “An old witch’s I know of. She will rage! It will fun hear her cursing swearing. We would serve every house row, would could get with. Come along. Here is rope tie her door first.” I followed him, without inward misgivings, I kept well I could. I argued myself, “_I_ it; I going Peter: business anybody’s long I do not touch thing myself?” Only minutes more, I helping Peter tie rope latch-handle poor little cottage, saying myself, “This does not matter. This will not her harm. This is not smoke. And all, smoke will not hurt nasty old thing. It will make her angry. It may her cough good: I dare say she is got cough.” I knew I saying false, yet I acted it. Was wicked wickedness could be? One moment more, Peter blowing hollow cabbage stalk keyhole his might. Catching breath stifling smoke himself, however, he began cough violently, passed wicked instrument me. I put mouth it, blew might. I believe far objectionable stuff mingled tow. In moments heard old woman begin cough. Peter, peeping window, whispered-- “She is rising. Now we will catch it, Ranald!” Coughing she came, I heard her shuffling steps approach door, thinking open air. When she failed opening it, found besides smoke coming from, she broke torrent fierce vengeful reproaches, mingled epithets means flattering. She curse swear Peter led expect, although her language certainly far enough refined; therein I, being, great measure, guilty because, blame she. I laughed I would unworthy companion, genuinely amused; I was, reality, shocked tempest I raised. I stopped blowing, aghast I done; Peter caught tube hand recommenced assault fresh vigour, whispering keyhole, every blasts, provoking, irritating, even insulting remarks old woman’s personal appearance supposed ways living. This threw her paroxysms rage coughing, increasing violence; war words grew, she tugging door she screamed, he answering merrily, pretended sympathy her sufferings, I lost remaining delicacy humour wicked game, laughed loud heartily. Of sudden scolding coughing ceased. A strange sound silence followed. Then came shrill, suppressed scream; heard voice girl, crying: “Grannie! grannie! What is matter you? Cannot speak me, grannie? They have smothered grannie!” Sobs moans heard now. Peter taken fright last, busy undoing rope. Suddenly he flung door wide fled, leaving exposed full gaze girl. To horror Elsie Duff! She approaching door, her eyes streaming tears, her sweet face white agony. I stood unable move speak. She turned away without word, began busy herself old woman, lay ground two yards door. I heard heavy step approaching. Guilt awoke fear restored powers motion. I fled full speed, find Mason, leave everything behind me. When I reached manse, stood alone starry blue night. Somehow I could help thinking time I came home waking barn. That, too, time misery, but, oh! different this! Then I cruelly treated myself; I actually committed cruelty. Then I sought father’s bosom one refuge; I dreaded sight father, I could look face. He father, I his son. A hurried glance late life revealed I behaving badly, growing worse worse. I became miserable I stood, I could tell. The cold length drove house. I generally sat father his study winter night now, I dared go near it. I crept nursery, I found bright fire burning, Allister reading blaze, Davie lay bed side room. I sat warmed myself, warmth could reach lump ice heart. I sat stared fire. Allister much occupied his book take heed me. All I felt pair little arms neck, Davie trying climb upon knees. Instead comforted, however, I spoke crossly, sent back his bed whimpering. You see I miserable; I repentant. I eating husks swine, relish them; I said, “I arise go father”. How I got rest evening I hardly know. I tried read, could not. I rather fond arithmetic; I got slate tried work sum; moments I sick it. At family prayers I never lifted head look father, over, I said good night him, I felt I sneaking room. But I small sense protection safety bed beside little Davie, sound asleep, looked innocent little Samuel voice God going call him. I put arm round him, hugged close me, began cry, crying brought sleep. It long time since I dreamt old childish dream; night returned. The old sunny-faced sun looked upon solemnly. There smile his big mouth, twinkle corners his little eyes. He looked Mrs. Moon much say, “What done? The boy going wrong way: must disown him?” The moon neither shook her head moved her lips, turned pivot, stood her back her husband, looking miserable. Not one star-children moved place. They shone sickly small. In little faded out; moon paled paled she vanished without ever turning her face her husband; last sun began change, instead paling he drew his beams, shrunk smaller smaller, bigger candle-flame. Then I found I staring candle table; Tom kneeling side bed, saying his prayers. CHAPTER XVII The Trouble Grows When I woke morning, I tried persuade I made great deal much whole business; dignified thing do, worst boy’s trick; I would say Peter Mason, betrayed last moment without even temptation benefit himself. I went school usual. It day Shorter Catechism. None failed Peter me; two kept alone, left schoolroom together. I seated far I could. In half hour he learned his task, I mastered half mine. Thereupon he proceeded, regardless entreaties, prevent learning it. I begged, prayed, appealed his pity, he would pull book away me, gabble bits ballads ear I struggling _Effectual Calling_, tip form I seated, and, short, annoy twenty different ways. At last I began cry, Mason bigger stronger boy I, I could help him. Lifting head first vexation over, I thought I saw shadow pass window. Although I could positively say I saw it, I conviction Turkey, heart began turn towards him. Emboldened fancied proximity, I attempted lesson more, moment Peter upon like spider. At last, however, growing suddenly weary sport, he desisted, said: “Ran, stay like. I have learned catechism, I do not see I wait _his_ time.” As he spoke he drew picklock his pocket--his father ironmonger--deliberately opened schoolroom door, slipped out, locked behind him. Then he came one windows, began making faces me. But vengeance nigher he knew. A deeper shadow darkened page, I looked up, Turkey towering Mason, his hand his collar, his whip lifted. The whip look formidable. Mason received threat joke, laughed Turkey’s face. Perceiving, however, Turkey looked dangerous, sudden wriggle, he adept, he broke free, and, trusting his tried speed foot, turned his head made grimace he took his heels. Before, however, he could widen space sufficiently, Turkey’s whip came upon him. With howl pain Peter doubled up, Turkey fell upon him, and, heedless his yells cries, pommelled severely. Although distance, great distinguishing words, I could hear Turkey mingled admonition punishment. A little longer, Peter crept past window, miserable mass collapsed unstrung impudence, his face bleared crying, his knuckles dug his eyes. And boy I chosen leader! He false me, I said myself; noble Turkey, seeing his behaviour window, watched give his deserts. My heart full gratitude. Once Turkey drew near window. What dismay indignation hear utter following words: “If were not father’s son, Ranald, old friend, I would serve same.” Wrath pride arose idea Turkey, used call horse, behaving fashion; and, evil ways half made sneak me, I cried out: “I will tell father, Turkey.” “I wish would, I tell-tale he asked why, I told it. You young blackguard! You are gentleman! To sneak streets hit girls snowballs! I scorn you!” “You must watching, then, Turkey, business that,” I said, plunging defence. “I watching you. But I been, would right watching Hawkie. You ill-behaved creature! You are true minister’s son.” “It is mean thing do, Turkey,” I persisted, seeking stir anger blow self-approval. “I tell I it. I met Elsie Duff crying street hit her dirty snowball. And go smoke her her poor grannie, till old woman fell faint fit, I do not know which! You deserve good pommelling yourself, I tell you, Ranald. I am ashamed you.” He turned go away. “Turkey, Turkey,” I cried, “is not old woman better?” “I do not know. I am going see,” he answered. “Come back tell me, Turkey,” I shouted, he disappeared field vision. “Indeed I will not. I do not choose keep company you. But ever I hear touching again, shall you will like, may tell father please.” I indeed sunk low Turkey, friend, would nothing say more. In minutes master returned, finding crying, touched compassion. He sent home once, well me, I could repeated single question. He thought Peter crept one panes opened ventilation, interrogate his disappearance. The whole rest day miserable enough. I even hazarded one attempt making friends Mrs. Mitchell, she repelled rudely I try again. I could bear company either Allister Davie. I would gone told Kirsty, I said Turkey must already prejudiced her me. I went bed moment prayers over, slept troubled sleep. I dreamed Turkey gone told father, he turned house. CHAPTER XVIII Light Darkness I woke early Sunday morning, dreary morning was. I could lie bed, and, although one yet, rose dressed myself. The house waste sepulchre. I opened front door went out. The world better. The day hardly begun dawn. The dark dead frost held chains iron. The sky dull leaden, cindery flakes snow thinly falling. Everywhere life looked utterly dreary hopeless. What worth living for? I went road, ice ruts crackled feet like bones dead things. I wandered away house, keen wind cut bone, I put plaid cloak. I turned field, stumbled along uneven surface, swollen hard frozen lumps, like walking upon stones. The summer gone winter here, heart colder miserable winter world. I found length hillock Turkey I lain lovely afternoon year before. The stream dumb frost. The wind blew wearily sharply across bare field. There Elsie Duff, head drooping her knitting, seated summer grass side singing brook. Her head aching her pillow I struck her vile lump; instead odour white clover she breathing dregs hateful smoke I filled cottage. I sat down, cold was, frozen hillock, buried face hands. Then dream returned upon me. This I sat dream father turned out-of-doors. Oh dreadful would be! I lie die. I could sit long cold. Mechanically I rose paced about. But I grew wretched body made forget trouble mind, I wandered home again. The house stirring. I crept nursery, undressed, lay beside little Davie, cried his sleep cold feet touched him. But I sleep again, although I lay till rest gone parlour. I found seated round blazing fire waiting father. He came soon after, breakfast, Davie gave his crumbs usual robins sparrows came hopping window-sill. I fancied father’s eyes often turned direction, I could lift mine make sure. I never known misery was. Only Tom I went church day: cold. My father preached text, “Be sure sin shall find out”. I thought he found sin, preparing punish it, I filled terror well dismay. I could scarcely keep seat, wretched I. But many instances punishment come upon evil-doers least expected it, spite every precaution fortify it, he proceeded say man’s sin might find long punishment overtook him, drew picture misery wicked man fled none pursued him, trembled rustling leaf, I certain he knew I done, seen face conscience. When last went home, I kept waiting whole day storm break, expecting every moment called his study. I enjoy mouthful food, I felt his eyes upon me, tortured me. I like shy creature woods whose hole stopped up: I place refuge--nowhere hide head; I felt naked! My soul naked. After tea I slunk away nursery, sat staring fire. Mrs. Mitchell came several times scolded sitting there, instead Tom rest parlour, I miserable even answer her. At length she brought Davie, put bed; minutes after, I heard father coming stair Allister, chatting away him. I wondered he could. My father came big Bible his arm, his custom Sunday nights, drew chair table, rang candles, Allister his side seated opposite him, began find place read us. To yet stronger conviction, he began read without word remark parable Prodigal Son. When he came father’s delight back, robe, shoes, ring, I could repress tears. “If I could go back,” I thought, “and set right! I have never gone away.” It foolish thought, instantly followed longing impulse tell father it. How could I thought before? I waiting time sin find out; I frustrate sin, find father first? As soon he done reading, he opened his mouth make remark, I crept round table his side, whispered his ear,-- “Papa, I want speak you.” “Very well, Ranald,” he said, solemnly, I thought, usual; “come study.” He rose led way, I followed. A whimper disappointment came Davie’s bed. My father went kissed him, said he would soon back, whereupon Davie nestled satisfied. When reached study, he closed door, sat fire, drew towards him. I burst crying, could speak sobs. He encouraged kindly. He said-- “Have anything wrong, boy?” “Yes, papa, wrong,” I sobbed. “I am disgusted myself.” “I glad hear it, dear,” he returned. “There hope you, then.” “Oh! I do not know that,” I rejoined. “Even Turkey despises me.” “That is serious,” said father. “He is fine fellow, Turkey. I like despise me. But tell it.” It great difficulty I could begin, help questioning me, father length understood whole matter. He paused plunged thought; rose, saying,-- “It is serious affair, dear boy; told me, I shall able help you.” “But knew before, did not you, papa? Surely did!” “Not word it, Ranald. You fancied sin found out. I must go see poor woman is. I do not want reproach all, sorry, I like think helping make poor old woman wicked. She naturally sour disposition, made sourer still, doubt made her hate everybody she already inclined do. You working God parish.” I burst fresh tears. It dreadful. “What _am_ I do?” I cried. “Of course must beg Mrs. Gregson’s pardon, tell her sorry ashamed.” “Yes, yes, papa. Do let go you.” “It is late find her up, I am afraid; go see. We have done wrong, grievous wrong, boy, I cannot rest till I least know consequences it.” He put his long greatcoat muffler haste, seen I properly wrapped up, he opened door stepped out. But remembering promise he made Davie, he turned went nursery speak again, I awaited doorsteps. It would quite dark stars, snow give back shine. The earth swallowed rays, brighter it. But oh, change frightful morning! When father returned, I put hand his almost fearlessly Allister wee Davie might done, away walked together. “Papa,” I said, “why say _we_ done wrong? You it.” “My dear boy, persons near are, must bear consequences together wrong done one them, must, sense, bear other’s iniquities even. If I sin, must suffer; sin, boy, I must suffer. But all: lies upon us get rid wrong done; thus bear other’s sin. I accountable make amends far I can; also I get sorry make amends far can.” “But, papa, is not hard?” I asked. “Do think I like leave get sin best could, sink deeper deeper it? Should I grudge anything take weight sin, wrong others, you? Do think I want troubled it? Or I anything wrong, would think hard help good, set things right? Even people looked upon me, would say hard? Would rather say, ‘I am glad bear anything father: I will share him’?” “Yes, indeed, papa. I would rather share not, whatever was.” “Then see, boy, kind God tying us one bundle way. It grand beautiful thing fathers suffer children, children fathers. Come along. We must step out, I fear shall able make apology to-night. When we have got this, Ranald, must good deal careful company keep.” “Oh, papa,” I answered, “if Turkey would forgive me!” “There is fear. Turkey sure forgive you have done make amends. He is fine fellow, Turkey. I high opinion Turkey--as call him.” “If he would, papa, I wish company his.” “A boy wants various kinds companions, Ranald, I fear neglecting Turkey. You owe much.” “Yes, indeed I do, papa,” I answered; “and I neglecting him. If I kept Turkey, I never got dreadful scrape this.” “That light word use it, boy. Do not call wickedness scrape; wickedness certainly was, though I willing believe adequate idea time _how_ wicked was.” “I will not again, papa. But I relieved already.” “Perhaps poor old Mrs. Gregson relieved, though. You ought forget her.” Thus talking, hurried arrived cottage. A dim light visible window. My father knocked, Elsie Duff opened door. CHAPTER XIX Forgiveness When entered, sat old woman farther side hearth, rocking herself fro. I hardly dared look up. Elsie’s face composed sweet. She gave shy tremulous smile, went heart humbled dreadfully. My father took stool Elsie sitting. When he lowered upon it, his face nearly level old woman, took notice him, kept rocking herself fro moaning. He laid his hand hers, which, old withered clean, lay her knee. “How find to-night, Mrs. Gregson?” he asked. “I am ill-used woman,” she replied groan, behaving father maltreated her, whose duty make apology it. “I aware mean, Mrs. Gregson. That brought inquire you. I hope seriously worse it.” “I am ill-used woman,” she repeated. “Every man’s hand’s me.” “Well, I hardly think that,” said father cheerful tone. “_My_ hand’s now.” “If bring sons, Mr. Bannerman, mock poor, find amusement driving aged infirm death’s door, cannot say hand’s poor lone woman like me.” “But I do not bring sons so. If I I should not now. I willing bear part blame, Mrs. Gregson, say I bring sons kind wickedness, lay share, good deal.--Come here, Ranald.” I obeyed bowed head shame-stricken heart, I saw wrong I done father, although would unjust old woman, many would yet blame best man world wrongs his children. When I stood father’s side, old woman lifted her head cast scowling look, went rocking herself. “Now, boy,” said father, “tell Mrs. Gregson come to-night.” I use dreadful effort make speak. It like resisting dumb spirit forcing words lips. But I hesitate moment. In fact, I dared hesitate, I felt hesitation would defeat. “I came, papa----” I began. “No no, man,” said father; “you must speak Mrs. Gregson, me.” Thereupon I make fresh effort. When day I see child say words required him, I feel I felt then, think difficult he told; oh, I wish he would it, he might conqueror I I know he make effort, grow difficult make effort. I cannot thankful I able overcome now. “I came, Mrs. Gregson,” I faltered, “to tell I sorry I behaved ill you.” “Yes, indeed,” she returned. “How would like anyone come serve grand house? But poor lone widow woman like nothing thought of. Oh no! all.” “I ashamed myself,” I said, almost forcing confession upon her. “So ought days life. You deserve drummed town minister’s son are! Hoo!” “I will never again, Mrs. Gregson.” “You would better not, shall hear it, there is sheriff county. To insult honest people fashion!” I drew back, ever conscious wrong I done rousing unforgiving fierceness heart woman. My father spoke now. “Shall I tell you, Mrs. Gregson, made boy sorry, made willing come tell it?” “Oh, I have got friends all. The young prodigal!” “You coming pretty near it, Mrs. Gregson,” said father; “but have not touched quite. It friend spoke boy made unhappy he done, telling shame was, wicked him. Do know friend was?” “Perhaps I do, perhaps I do not. I guess.” “I fear do not guess quite correctly. It best friend ever ever have. It God talking poor boy’s heart. He would heed he said day, evening reading prodigal son went back his father, father forgave him; he could not stand longer, came told it.” “It was not he go to. It was not he smoked death--was now? It easy enough go you.” “Not easy perhaps. But he come now.” “Come made him!” “I did not make him. He came gladly. He saw he could make wrong he done.” “A poor amends!” I heard her grumble; father took notice. “And know, Mrs. Gregson,” he went on, “when prodigal son go back his father, his father forgave once.” “Easy enough! He his father, fathers always side sons.” I saw father thinking moment. “Yes; true,” he said. “And he himself, he always wants his sons daughters do. So he tells us do not forgive one another, he forgive us. And want forgiven, better mind we are told. If do not forgive boy, done great wrong, sorry it, God forgive you--and that is serious affair.” “He is never begged pardon yet,” said old woman, whose dignity required utter humiliation offender. “I beg pardon, Mrs. Gregson,” I said. “I shall never rude again.” “Very well,” she answered, little mollified last. “Keep promise, we will say it. It is father’s sake, mind, I forgive you.” I saw smile trembling father’s lips, he suppressed it, saying, “Will not shake hands him, Mrs. Gregson?” She held poor shrivelled hand, I took gladly; felt strange mine I frightened it: like something half dead. But moment, behind another hand, rough little hand, warm firm alive, slipped left hand. I knew Elsie Duff’s, thought I behaved her rushed upon cold misery shame. I would knelt her feet, I could speak sorrow witnesses. Therefore I kept hold her hand led her end cottage, friendly gloom, light place coming glow--not flame--of fire peat bark. She came readily, whispering I time open mouth-- I am sorry grannie’s hard make up.” “I deserve it,” I said. “Elsie, I am brute. I could knock head wall. Please forgive me.” “It is me,” she answered. “You did not hurt me. I did not mind it.” “Oh, Elsie! I struck horrid snowball.” “It back neck. It did not hurt much. It frightened me.” “I did not know you. If I known, I sure I should not done it. But wicked contemptible anyhow, girl.” I broke again, half shame, half happiness cast sin confessing it. Elsie held hand now. “Never mind; never mind,” she said; “you will not again.” “I would rather hanged,” I sobbed. That moment pair strong hands caught hold mine, next I found hoisted somebody is back, succession heaves pitches, cease I firmly seated. Then voice said-- “I am his horse again, Elsie, I will carry home night.” Elsie gave pleased little laugh; Turkey bore fireside, father talking away low tone old woman. I believe he turned tables upon her, trying convince her her unkind grumbling ways. But he let us hear word reproof. “Eh! Turkey, lad! you? I did not know there,” he said. I never heard father address Turkey. “What great boy upon back?” he continued. “I am going carry home, sir.” “Nonsense! He walk well enough.” Half ashamed, I began struggle get down, Turkey held tight. “But see, sir,” said Turkey, “we are friends now. _He’s_ done he could, _I_ want I can.” “Very well,” returned father, rising; “come along; it is time going.” When he bade her good night, old woman actually rose held her hand us. “Good night, Grannie,” said Turkey. “Good night, Elsie.” And away went. Never conqueror his triumphal entry happier I, starry night I rode home Turkey’s back. The stars seemed rejoicing head. When I think now, words always come it, “There joy presence angels God one sinner repenteth,” I cannot believe rejoiced then, ever I repented life I repented then. When length I bed beside Davie, seemed could nobody world blessed I was: I forgiven. When I woke morning, I new born new world. Before getting I rare game Davie, whose shrieks laughter length brought Mrs. Mitchell angry face; I found kindly disposed even towards her. The weather much same; dreariness vanished. There glowing spot heart drove cold, glorified black frost bound earth. When I went breakfast, saw red face sun looking mist like bright copper kettle, he seemed know it, friends he never before; I quite well satisfied sun dream given friendly nod forgiveness. CHAPTER XX I Have Fall Dream Elsie Duff’s father farm-labourer, large family. He called cottar Scotland, name implies large farm upon he worked yearly wages he little bit land cultivate his use. His wife’s mother Grannie Gregson. She old she needed someone look her, she cottage her village, would go live her daughter, and, indeed, anxious her, she means pleasant person. So help it: Elsie must go her companion. It great trial her first, her home happy one, her mother unlike her grandmother; and, besides, she greatly preferred open fields streets village. She grumble, however, good grumbling duty plain, even thing cannot helped? She found lonely though, especially her grannie one her gloomy moods. Then she would answer question, leave poor girl she thought best, complain afterwards. This partly reason her parents, towards close spring, sent little brother, delicate much use home, spend months his grannie, go school. The intention Elsie herself go school, cow her grandmother together she able begin. Of course grannie grumbled proposal, but, Turkey, informant points, explained, she afraid lest, she objected, take Elsie away send younger sister her place. So little Jamie Duff came school. He poor little white-haired, red-eyed boy, found much his element there. Some bigger boys imagined good fun tease him; whole he rather favourite, he looked pitiful, took everything patiently. For part, I delighted chance showing Elsie Duff kindness her brother. The girl’s sweetness clung me, rendered impossible rude girl, kept awake occurrence opportunity something her sake. Perceiving one day, master arrived, Jamie shivering cold, I made way I stood fire; found he next nothing upon his little body, soles his shoes hanging half off. This month March north Scotland bad enough, even he cough. I told father I went home, he sent tell Mrs. Mitchell look old garments Allister’s him; she declared none. When I told Turkey he looked grave, said nothing. When I told father, he desired take boy tailor shoemaker, get warm strong clothes shoes made him. I proud enough commission, I act grand benefactor little, I yet finished penance it, never comes mind without bringing shame it. Of many people shall I beg precious forgiveness I meet world! For sake penal shame, I confess I let little fellow walk behind me, I took streets. Perhaps I may say myself, I never thought demanding service return mine: I bad that. And I true heart notwithstanding pride, I real affection him. I seen his sister--to speak I mean--since Sunday night. One Saturday afternoon, game something like hare hounds, I running hard village, I set foot loose stone, violent fall. When I got up, I saw Jamie Duff standing side, face utter consternation. I discovered afterwards he way following about. Finding blood streaming face, remarking I came little I near house Turkey’s mother lived, I crawled thither, stairs her garret, Jamie following silence. I found her busy usual her wheel, Elsie Duff stood talking her, she run moment must sit down. Elsie gave little cry she saw state I in, Turkey’s mother got made take her chair she hastened get water. I grew faint, lost consciousness. When I came I leaning Elsie, whose face white sheet dismay. I took little water soon began revive. When Turkey’s mother tied head, I rose go home, she persuaded lie while. I unwilling comply. What sense blissful repose pervaded me, weary running, perhaps faint loss blood, I stretched bed, whose patchwork counterpane, let say Turkey’s mother, clean quilt chambers rich. I remember well single ray sunlight fell floor little window roof, foot kept turning spinning-wheel. Its hum sounded sleepy ears. I gazed sloping ray light, ceaseless rotation swift wheel kept motes dancing busily, length half-closed eyes became huge Jacob’s ladder, crowded innumerable company ascending descending angels, I thought must ladder I used see dream. The drowsy delight follows loss blood possessed me, little garret slanting roof, sloping sun-ray, whirr wheel, form patient woman span, begun gather hues Paradise slowly fading senses, I heard voice sounded miles away, yet close ear: “Elsie, sing little song, you?” I heard reply. A pause followed, voice, clear melodious brook, began sing, ceased, I indeed kind paradise. But I must pause. Shall I breaking promise word Scotch story, I give song? True part story exactly, it. If reader would like song, he must Scotch all. I going spoil turning natural clothes finer garments born--I mean translating Scotch English. The best way this: I give song something extra--call footnote slipped middle page. Nobody needs read word understand story; smaller type shape own, passed without least trouble. SONG Oh! bonny, bonny dell, whaur yorlin[1] sings, Wi’ clip sunshine atween his wings; Whaur birks[2] a’ straikit wi’ fair munelicht, And broom hings lamps day nicht; Whaur burnie comes trottin’ ower shingle stane, Liltin’ [3] bonny havers[4] til ‘tsel alane; And sliddery[5] troot, wi’ ae soop tail, Is awa’ ‘neath green weed’s swingin’ veil!

[Footnote 1: The Yellow-hammer.] [Footnote 2: Birch-trees.] [Footnote 3: Singing.] [Footnote 4: Nonsense.] [Footnote 5: Slippery.] Elsie’s voice went every corner brain: singing chambers. I could hear words song well enough understand quite; Turkey gave copy afterwards. They schoolmaster’s work. All winter, Turkey going evening school, master greatly pleased him, done his best get various ways. A friendship sprung them; one night he showed Turkey verses. Where air came from, I know: Elsie’s brain full tunes. I repeated father once, he greatly pleased them. On first acquaintance, however, put sleep; little Jamie Duff sent tell father happened. Jamie gave message Mrs. Mitchell, she, full her importance, must needs set see much matter. I dreaming unutterably delicious dream. It summer evening. The sun tremendous size, splendid rose-colour. He resting his lower edge horizon, dared go farther, flowers would sing instead giving proper scents, he left them, he feared utter anarchy his kingdom he got back morning. I woke saw ugly face Mrs. Mitchell bending me. She pushing me, calling wake up. The moment I saw her I shut eyes tight, turned away, pretended fast asleep again, hope she would go away leave friends. “Do let his sleep out, Mrs. Mitchell,” said Turkey’s mother. “You have let sleep long already,” she returned, ungraciously. “He will he can, waking sleeping, make troublesome. He is never-do-well, Ranald. Little good’ll ever come him. It is mercy his mother mould, he would broken her heart.” I come quite time, I least inclined acknowledge Mrs. Mitchell. “You are wrong there, Mrs. Mitchell,” said Elsie Duff; reader must remember required good deal courage stand woman much older herself, occupying important position housekeeper minister. “Ranald good boy. I am sure he is.” “How dare say so, he served poor old grandmother wicked trick? It is little children care parents nowadays. Do not speak me.” “No, do not, Elsie,” said another voice, accompanied creaking door heavy step. “Do not speak her, Elsie, you will worst it. Leave her me.--If Ranald say, Mrs. Mitchell, I do not deny it, he least sorry afterwards, begged grannie’s pardon; that is sort thing _you_ never life.” “I never occasion, Turkey; hold tongue.” “Now do not call _Turkey_. I will not stand it. I christened well you.” “And _you_ speak like that? Go home cows. I dare say they are standing supperless stalls you are gadding about. I will call _Turkey_ long I please.” “Very well, Kelpie--that is name you are known by, though perhaps one polite enough use face, you are great woman, doubt--I give warning I know you. When you are found out, do not say I did not give chance beforehand.” “You impudent beggar!” cried Mrs. Mitchell, rage. “And you are one pack,” she added, looking round two others. “Get up, Ranald, come home directly. What lying shamming for?” As she spoke, she approached bed; Turkey quick her, got front it. As he great strong lad, she dared lay hands upon him, she turned rage stalked room, saying, “Mr. Bannerman shall hear this.” “Then it will sides it, Mrs. Mitchell,” I cried bed; she vanished, vouchsafing reply. Once Turkey got his back carried home. I told father whole occurrence. He examined cut plastered me, saying he would go thank Turkey’s mother once. I confess I thought Elsie Duff her wonderful singing, put sleep, given strange lovely dream rough hands harsh voice Kelpie waked soon. After this, although I never dared go near her grandmother’s house alone, I yet, loitering watching, got many peep Elsie. Sometimes I went Turkey his mother’s evening, father objection, somehow Elsie sure there, spent happy hour two together. Sometimes she would sing, sometimes I would read Milton--I read whole Comus degrees way; although much I could understand, I perfectly certain ennobling effect upon every one us. It necessary intellect define separate heart soul derive nourishment. As well say bee get nothing flower, she understand botany. The music stately words poem enough generate better mood, make one feel air higher regions, wish rise “above smoke stir dim spot”. The best influences bear upon us vague sort--powerful upon heart conscience, although undefined intellect. But I find I forgetting I write young--too young understand this. Let remain, however, older persons odd moment, waiting dinner, going bed, may take little one’s book, turn leaves. Some readers, virtue hearts young old once, discern children’s books children themselves. CHAPTER XXI The Bees’ Nest It twelve of the clock delicious Saturday height summer. We poured school gladness holiday hearts. I sauntered home full summer sun, summer wind, summer scents filled air. I know often I sat perfect bliss upon earthen walls divided fields road, basked heat. These walls covered grass moss. The odour certain yellow feathery flower, grew rather plentifully, used give special delight. Great humble-bees haunted walls, poking constantly. Butterflies also found pleasant places, I delighted butterflies, though I seldom succeeded catching one. I remember I ever killed one. Heart conscience that. I got loan Mrs. Trimmer’s story family Robins, every reading page unspeakable delight. We books children days far out-of-the-way place, get dearly prized. It almost dinner-time I reached home. Somehow grand weather, welcome dinner always was, possess amount interest cold bitter winter. This day I almost hurried mine get broad sunlight. Oh, stately hollyhocks towered borders shrubbery! The guelder-roses hung like balls snow wilderness green leaves; damask roses, dark almost blackness, soft velvety surface, enriched sunny air colour scent. I never see roses now. And little bushes polyanthus gemmed dark earth varied hues. We know anything flowers except delight gave us, I dare say I putting together would time, picture comes back memory. I leaning utter idleness gate separated little lawn surroundings road, troop children passed, little baskets tin pails hands; amongst Jamie Duff. It least necessary ask he going. Not far, mile house, rose certain hill famed country round store bilberries. It Turkey I fled refuge bull. It called Ba’ Hill, tradition lingered neighbourhood many years ago battle there, battle conquerors played football heads vanquished slain, hence name hill; fought conquered, shadow record. It wild country, conflicting clans often wrought wild work it. In summer hill course haunt children gathering bilberries. Jamie shyly suggested whether I would join them, much younger myself; besides I felt drawn seek Turkey field cattle--that is, I get quite tired nothing. So little troop streamed on, I remained leaning gate. I suppose I sunk dreamy state, I suddenly startled sound beside me, looking about, saw old woman, bent nearly double within old grey cloak, notwithstanding heat. She leaned stick, carried bag like pillow-case her hand. It one poor people village, going her rounds her weekly dole handful oatmeal. I knew her well sight name--she old Eppie--and kindly greeting passed us. I thank God frightful poor-laws invaded Scotland I boy. There degradation honest poverty then, burden supplied wants; every person known, kindly feelings nourished sides. If I understand anything human nature now, comes partly known respected poor father’s parish. She passed gate went usual kitchen door, I stood drowsily contemplating green expanse growing crops valley me. The day grown sleepy myself. There noises except hum unseen insects, distant rush water dams bathing-place. In minutes old woman approached again. She honest worthy soul, civil her manners. Therefore I surprised hear her muttering herself. Turning, I saw she angry. She ceased her muttering she descried observing her, walked silence--was even pass little wicket side larger gate without salutation. Something vexed her, instinctively I put hand pocket, pulled halfpenny father given morning--very came way--and offered her. She took half-ashamed glance, attempt courtesy, murmured blessing. Then moment she looked say something, changing her mind, she added another grateful word, hobbled away. I pondered feeble fashion moment, came conclusion Kelpie rude her, forgot her, fell a-dreaming again. Growing length tired nothing, I roused myself, set seek Turkey. I lingered almost foolishly day. But I recall childhood, day always comes back type best it. I remember I visited Kirsty, find Turkey was. Kirsty welcomed usual, she always loving kind us; although I visit her often now, she knew I father, lessons learn she could assist me. Having nothing else talk about, I told her Eppie, her altered looks she came house. Kirsty compressed her lips, nodded her head, looked serious, made reply. Thinking strange, I resolved tell Turkey, otherwise I might done. I pursue matter Kirsty, I knew her well enough know her manner indicated mood nothing could drawn. Having learned he was, I set find him--close scene adventure Wandering Willie. I soon came sight cattle feeding, see Turkey. When I came near mound, I caught glimpse head old Mrs. Gregson’s cow quietly feeding top wall side, like outcast Gentile; father’s cows, like favoured greedy Jews, busy short clover inside. Grannie’s cow managed live notwithstanding, I dare say gave good milk, though perhaps quite much it, ill-tempered Hawkie. Mrs. Gregson’s granddaughter, however, eat grass, inside wall, seated stone Turkey doubt dragged her. Trust her Turkey, cow mouthful without leave father. Elsie usual busy her knitting. And I caught sight Turkey, running neighbouring cottage spade his shoulder. Elsie minding cows him. “What is ado, Turkey?” I cried, running meet him. “Such wild bees’ nest!” answered Turkey. “I am glad you are come! I thinking whether I would not run fetch you. Elsie I watching going last half-hour.--Such lots bees! There is store honey _there_.” “But is not soon take it, Turkey? There will great deal weeks.--Not I know anything bees,” I added deferentially. “You are quite right, Ranald,” answered Turkey; “but several things considered. In first place, nest roadside, somebody else might find it. Next, Elsie never tasted honey her life, _is_ nice, she is, ready eat some. Thirdly, lastly, father says--though often,” added Turkey slyly, meaning _lastly_ seldom came _thirdly_,--“if take honey now, bees plenty time gather enough winter flowers gone, whereas leave long starve.” I satisfied reasoning, made objection. “You must keep sharp look-out though, Ranald,” he said; “for they will mad enough, must keep cap.” He took his own, gave Elsie, saying: “Here, Elsie: must look out, keep bees. I tell sting joke. I have three myself.” “But _you_ do, Turkey?” asked Elsie, anxious face. “Oh, Ranald keep too. I shall not heed them. I must dig away, get honey.” All things thus arranged, Turkey manfully approached _dyke_, call kind wall-fence there. In midst grass moss one little hole, bees kept going coming busily. Turkey put his finger felt direction hole went, thence judging position hoard, struck his spade firm foot dyke. What bees came rushing fear rage, I quite enough keep bare heads cap. Those returning, laden were, joined defence, I best, tolerable success. Elsie little distance, comparatively still, less object resentment. In moments Turkey reached store. Then he began dig carefully keep spoiling honey. First he took quantity cells nothing grub-like things--the cradles young bees were. He threw away, went digging coolly he gardening. All defence he left me, I assure I enough it, thought mine harder work two: hand eye rest, mind stretch anxiety time. But Turkey stooped nest, cleared away earth his hands, much care drew great piece honeycomb, well put together comb educated bees garden-hive, know working critics. Its surface even yellow, showing cells full brim rich store. I think I see Turkey weighing his hand, turning pick away bits adhering mould ere he presented Elsie. She sat her stone like patient, contented queen, waiting her subjects would bring her. “Oh, Turkey! piece!” she said she took it, opened her pretty mouth white teeth bite treasure. “Now, Ranald,” said Turkey, “we must finish job ourselves.” He went carefully removing honey, piling bank. There great deal, early year, another comb equal he given Elsie. But he got out-- “They will soon find another nest,” he said. “I do not think it is use leaving open them. It spoils dyke too.” As he spoke he began fill hole, beat earth hard. Last all, he put sod first dug away, grass flowers still growing upon it. This done, he proceeded divide remained honey. “There is piece Allister Davie,” he said; “and here is piece you, me, Elsie take rest home herself Jamie.” Elsie protested, insisted. Turkey got nice clover, laid bits honeycomb it. Then sat ate shares, chatted away long time, Turkey I getting every look cattle, Elsie sometimes follow her cow, she threatened inroad upon neighbouring field away. But plenty time between, Elsie sung us two three songs earnest request, Turkey told us one two stories history books he reading, I pulled story Robins read them. And hot sun went glowing west, threw longer longer shadows eastward. A great shapeless blot darkness, legs it, accompanied every cow, calf, bullock wherever went. There new shadow crop grass, huge patch long tree-shapes end it, stretched away foot hillock. The weathercock top church glistening bright gold, wonder could keep breaking crow would rouse cocks neighbourhood, even although beginning get sleepy, thinking going roost. It time cattle, Elsie’s cow included, go home; for, although latter plenty eat rest, she day, come upon several nice little patches clover, overflowed edges fields levels dry ditches sides road. But rose break assembly, spied little girl come flying across field, winged news. As she came nearer recognized her. She lived near Mrs. Gregson’s cottage, one little troop I seen pass manse way gather bilberries. “Elsie! Elsie!” she cried, “John Adam taken Jamie. Jamie fell, John got him.” Elsie looked frightened, Turkey laughed, saying: “Never mind, Elsie. John better he looks. He will not least harm. He must mind his business, know.” The Ba’ Hill covered young plantation firs, which, hardy were, yet measure coaxed growing inclement region. It amongst small stems coveted bilberries grew, company cranberries crowberries, dwarf junipers. The children village thus attracted place doubt careless young trees, might sometimes even amuse damage. Hence keeper, John Adam, whose business look them, found his duty wage war upon annual hordes invaders; eyes Adam terrible man. He long lean, flattish yet Roman nose, rather ill-tempered mouth, his face dead-white much pitted small-pox. He wore corduroy breeches, blue coat, nightcap striped horizontally black red. The youngsters pretended determine, direction tassel hung, mood owner in; deny inductions may led conclusions quite correct scientific observers. At events tassel warning, terror, hope. He could run fast, fortunately, lean legs within ribbed grey stockings subject rheumatism, could take long rapid strides; children tolerable start, misfortune choose terror impassable direction, pretty sure get off. Jamie Duff, harmless conscientious creature, would injured young fir upon temptation, take wrong direction, caught his foot hole, fell furze bush, and, nearly paralysed terror, seized long fingers Adam, ignominiously lifted portion his garments vast aërial space ground white, pock-pitted face keeper. Too frightened scream, conscious trespass make resistance, he borne warning rest improbable fate awaited them. But character Adam means frightful eyes Turkey; he soon succeeded partially composing trepidation Elsie, assuring her soon he put cattle, he would walk Adam’s house try get Jamie off, whereupon Elsie set home her cow, disconsolate hopeful. I think I see her yet--for I recall every picture lovely day clear light red sunset--walking slowly her head bent half trouble, half attention her knitting, her solemn cow, seemed take twice long get ground she two pairs legs instead one shuffle across it, dragging her long iron chain short stake end her gentle clatter hard dry road. I accompanied Turkey, helped fasten bed cows, went shared his hasty supper potatoes oatcake milk, set refreshed, nowise apprehensive his company, seek abode redoubtable ogre, John Adam. CHAPTER XXII Vain Intercession He small farm his foot hill he charge. It poor little place, low thatched cottage dwelling. A sister kept house him. When approached one seen. We advanced door along rough pavement round stones, parted house dunghill. I peeped little window passed. There, astonishment, I saw Jamie Duff, I thought, looking happy, act lifting spoon his mouth. A moment after, however, I concluded I must mistaken, for, Turkey lifted latch walked in, awful John his long sister seated table, poor Jamie corner, basin his hand, face looked dismal dreary enough. I fancied I caught glimpse Turkey laughing his sleeve, felt mildly indignant him--for Elsie’s sake more, I confess, Jamie’s. “Come in,” said Adam, rising; but, seeing was, he seated again, adding, “Oh, it is you, Turkey!”--Everybody called Turkey. “Come take spoon.” “No, thank you,” said Turkey; “I supper. I came inquire young rascal there.” “Ah! see him! There he is!” said Adam, looking towards awful expression his dead brown eyes. “Starving. No home supper him! He will sleep hay-loft rats mice, stray cat two.” Jamie put his cuffs, perennial handkerchief poor little brothers, his eyes. His fate full horrors. But I thought I saw Turkey laughing his sleeve. “His sister anxious him, Mr. Adam,” he said. “Could not let once?” “On account. I trust, I must duty. The duke gives forest charge me. I got look it.” I could help thinking poor thing forest. All I knew forests story-books, full ever grand trees. Adam went on-- “And wicked boys break trees--” “I pulled bilberries,” interposed Jamie, whine went howl. “James Duff!” said Adam, awful authority, “I saw tumble young larch tree, two feet high.” “The worse me!” sobbed Jamie. “Tut! tut! Mr. Adam! larch tree was not baby,” said Turkey. “Let Jamie go. He could not help it, see.” “It _was_ baby, _is_ baby,” said Adam, solitary twinkle determined dead brown his eyes. “And I will intercession here. Transgressors must prosecuted, board says. And prosecuted he shall be. He shall not get school-time to-morrow morning. He shall late, too, I hope master give well. We must make examples, see, Turkey. It is use saying anything. I do not say Jamie’s worse boy rest, he is bad, else he come tumbling babies? Answer that, Master Bannerman.” He turned fixed his eyes upon me. There question his mouth, neither question speculation his eyes. I could meet awful changeless gaze. My eyes sank his. “Example, Master Bannerman, everything. If serve trees young man done--” The idea James Duff young man! “--I will serve I serve him--and that is sweet service, I will warrant.” As keeper ended, he brought his fist table bang, poor Jamie almost fell stool he sat corner. “But let once,” pleaded Turkey, “and I will surety he will never again.” “Oh, him, I am afraid him,” returned keeper; “but surety fifty boys that will make game I do not make example him? I am luck caught him. No, no, Turkey; will not do, man. I am sorry his father his mother, his sister Elsie, they are good people; I must make example him.” At mention his relatives Jamie burst another suppressed howl. “Well, will not hard upon anyhow: now?” said Turkey. “I will not pull his skin _quite_ his ears,” said Adam; “and that is promise you will get me.” The tall thin grim sister sat time she right aware anything going on, her nose, hooked her brother’s, larger, looked if, absence eyes ears, taking cognizance everything, would inform rest senses afterwards. I suspicion keeper’s ferocity assumed occasion, he ogre I considered him. Still, prospect poor little Jamie spending night alone loft amongst cats rats sufficiently dreadful I thought midnight awaking barn. There seemed help, however, especially Turkey rose say good night. I felt disconsolate, well pleased Turkey’s coolness. I thought he done his best. When got road-- “Poor Elsie!” I said; “she will miserable Jamie.” “Oh no,” returned Turkey. “I will go straight tell her. No harm come Jamie. John Adam’s bark good deal worse his bite. Only I liked take home I could.” It twilight, glimmering dusk walked back manse. Turkey left gate strode towards village; I turned in, revolving new scheme arisen brain, first time sense rivalry Turkey awoke bosom. He everything Elsie Duff, I nothing. For her he robbed bees’ nest day, I partaken spoil. Nay, he stung her service; for, care--and I think whole I done best--he received threatened bad sting back his neck. Now he going comfort her her brother he failed rescue; I succeed he failed, carry poor boy home triumph! As left keeper’s farm, Turkey pointed me, across yard, small rick two standing, loft Jamie would sleep. It cart-she would, approach ladder. But reported rats, would hardship sleep weather like this, especially one brought Jamie been. But I knew he timid boy, I would lain horror night. Therefore I way turning mind I could release him. But whatever I must unaided, I could reckon upon Turkey, indeed heart share honour enterprise opened me. CHAPTER XXIII Knight-Errantry I must mention father never objected riding his little mare Missy, called her. Indeed, I great liberty regard her, took her trot gallop often I pleased. Sometimes press work she would go cart drag harrow, she handy could anything her; happen often, her condition seasons year testified she knew little hard work. My father fond her, used tell wonderful stories her judgment skill. I believe he never quite without hope somehow he find her next world. At events I certain hard believe much wise affection created uncreated. I cannot say I ever heard give utterance anything sort; whence else I firm conviction, dating period farther back memory reach, whatever might become horses, Missy sure go heaven? I kind notion that, bearer father upon his missions doctrine mercy, she belonged clergy, and, sharing privileges, must chance animals her kind. I believe right instinct glad foolish reason. I wiser now, extend hope rest horses, I cannot believe God nothing vain ever creates order destroy. I made haste learn lessons Monday, although fashion, mind full adventure me. As soon prayers supper over--that is, ten of the clock--I crept house away stable. It lovely night. A kind grey peace filled earth air sky. It dark, although rather cloudy; dim dusk, like vapour darkness, floated around everything. I fond night, I never contemplated going far alone. I not, however, feel alone Missy me, she I best terms, although sometimes she would take fit obstinacy, refuse go direction she pleased. Of late, however, she asserted herself less frequently manner. I suppose she aware I grew stronger determined. I soon managed open door stable, I knew key lay. It dark, I felt way through, talking time horses might startled I came upon one unexpectedly, stable narrow, sometimes lay good bit stalls. I took care, however, speak low tone man slept wooden partition stable might hear. I soon bridle upon Missy, would lose time putting saddle. I led her out, got her back help stone stable door, rode away. She scarcely day, rather mood ride. The voice Andrew, noise her feet aroused, came me, calling know was. I called reply, I feared he might rouse place; he went back composed, contented. It use, events, follow me. I gone far extreme stillness night began sink soul make quiet. Everything seemed thinking me, nothing would tell thought. Not feeling, however, I wrong, I awed frightened stillness. I made Missy slacken her speed, rode gently, better harmony night. Not sound broke silence except rough cry land-rail fields clatter Missy’s feet. I like noise she made, got upon grass, fence. But moment she felt soft grass, she went sudden gallop. Her head I least warning her intention. She tore away field quite another direction I taking her, gallop quickened she going her utmost speed. The rapidity motion darkness together--for seemed darkness now--I confess made frightened. I pulled hard reins, without avail. In minute I lost reckoning, could tell I field, pretty large one; soon finding galloping hill steep I trouble retaining seat, I began, comfort, surmise direction mare carrying me. We approaching place sat afternoon, close mound trees upon it, scene adventure Wandering Willie, fancied murder. I scarcely thought either shadows begun fall long, night, shadow, reflections made horrible. Besides, Missy get bog! But she knew better that, wild her mood was. She avoided it, galloped past, bore far frightful goal, suddenly dropping canter, standing stock-still. It cottage half ruins, occupied old woman I dimly recollected gone father see--a good many years ago, appeared now. She still alive, however, old, bedridden. I recollected top her wooden bed hung rope her pull herself she wanted turn, she rheumatic, rope filled horror. But sort. The cottage smithy, bellows left place. Now nothing particularly frightful pair bellows, however large may be, yet recollection huge structure leather wood, great iron nose projecting contracting cheeks it, head old woman’s bed, capable yet useless, return upon terror dusk lonely night. It mingled vague suspicion old woman bit witch, doubtful memory she seen one occasion night-farer, frightful storm raging, blowing away bellows hard her skinny arms lean body could work lever, almost great storm wind her little room outside it. If truth story, easily accounted fact poor old woman little her mind many years,--and wonder, she nearly hundred, said. Neither wonder Missy stopped almost suddenly, her fore-feet her neck stretched forward, her nose pointed straight door cottage yards’ distance, I felt queer indeed. Whether hair stood end I know, I certainly feel skin creep me. An ancient elder-tree grew one end cottage, I heard lonely sigh little breeze wander branches. The next instant frightful sound within cottage broke night air seemed universal shriek. Missy gave plunge, turned round her hind-legs, tore place. I nearly lost seat, terror made cling faster companion, _ventre-à-terre_ she flew home. It take her minute reach stable-door. There she stop, I shut I brought her out. It mortifying find instead John Adam’s hayloft, rescuer Jamie Duff. But I think while. Shaken terror, afraid dismount next ground, I called upon Andrew well fear would permit; voice nearly unmanageable, I could little howl it. In minutes, time awful duration--for could tell might following hollow?--Andrew appeared half-dressed, best tempers, remarking odd thing go riding honest people beds, except, he added, I meant take highway. Thereupon, rendered communicative trial I gone through, I told whole story, I intended I frustrated. He listened, scratched his head, saying someone ought see anything matter old woman, turned put rest his clothes. “You better go home bed, Ranald,” he said. “Will not frightened, Andrew?” I asked. “Frightened? What I frightened at? It is waste frightened know whether thing worth it.” My courage reviving fast warm presence human being. I still seated Missy. To go home done nothing Jamie, therefore nothing Elsie, grand ideas rescue restoration, mortifying. I feel small I woke morning! And yet suppose something gave fearful cry cottage roaming fields looking mel I courage enough, however, remain I till Andrew came again, I sat still mare’s back, courage gradually rose. Nothing increases terror much running away. When he reappeared, I asked him: “What think could be, Andrew?” “How I tell?” returned Andrew. “The old woman queer cock, I know, always roosts top her bed, crows like cock I ever heard crow. Or might Wandering Willie--he goes see her sometimes, demented creature might strike his pipes unearthly hour.” I satisfied either suggestion; sound I heard already grown indistinct memory, anything I could tell might either. The terror woke mind rendered incapable making observations setting facts regard it. I could remember I heard frightful noise, like I could scarcely bear smallest testimony. I begged Andrew put saddle me, I command Missy. He went got it, appearing, I thought, over-anxious old Betty; I meantime buckled old rusty spur lay stable window, leathers crumbling flakes. Thus armed, mounted feet stirrups, therefore good pull Missy’s mouth, I found courage equal task me. Andrew I parted right angles; he across field old Betty’s cottage, I along road direction John Adam’s farm. CHAPTER XXIV Failure It must eleven of the clock. The clouds cleared off, night changed brown grey blue sparkling gold. I could see much better, fancied I could hear better too. But neither advantage much me. I ridden far stable, I found much alone unprotected, wide, silent fields me, wider silent sky head. The fear began return. I fancied something strange creeping along every ditch--something shapeless, terrible cry it. Next I thought I saw scarcely visible form--now like creature all-fours, like man, far off, coming rapidly towards across nearest field. It always vanished, however, came close. The worst was, faster I rode, frightened I became; speed seemed draw terrors faster me. Having discovered this, I changed plan, I felt frightened, drew rein went slower. This throw sort defiance fear; certainly often I abated. Fear worse thing danger. I pass nigh pool Turkey I gone night adventure Bogbonny’s bull. That story far past, I relish dull shine water hollow, notwithstanding. In fact I owed greater part courage I possessed--and little enough needs--to Missy. I dared gone two legs. It I could easily run away four instead, somehow I lifted ordinary level fear upon her back. I think many men draw courage horses. At length I came sight keeper’s farm; moment moon peeped behind hill, throwing long shadows setting sun, direction. The shadows different too. Somehow liker light made sun-shadows sunlight. Both light shadows moon strange fearful me. The sunlight shadows strong real friendly, seem know them; belong house, sweep fear dismay honest people’s hearts. But moon shadows different indeed. The fact is, moon trying she cannot do. She trying dispel great sun-shadow--for night gathering one mass shadows sun. She able this, her light her own; second-hand sun himself; her shadows therefore also second-hand shadows, pieces cut great sun-shadow, coloured little moon’s yellowness. If I writing grown people I tell understand things think them, ask God teach them, walk sunlight; others, take things people tell so, always walking strange moonlight, subject end stumbles terrors, hardly know light darkness. Well, first, moon frightened little--she looked knowing, yet she said round strange. But I rode quietly back yard ricks stood, got Missy fastened bridle gate, walked across cart-she would, moon shining upon ladder leading loft. I climbed ladder, several failures succeeded finding door fastened. When I opened it, moonlight got me, poured upon heap straw farthest corner, Jamie lying asleep rug him. I crossed floor, knelt him, tried wake him. This easy. He far sound asleep troubled rats; sleep armour--yes, castle--against many enemies. I got hold one his hands, lifting pull found cord tied his wrist. I indignant: actually manacled like thief! I gave cord great tug anger, pulled knife, cut it; then, hauling Jamie up, got half-awake last. He stared fright first, began cry. As soon he awake enough know me, he stopped crying staring, his eyes seemed nothing better moonlight them. “Come along, Jamie,” I said. “I am come take home.” “I do not want go home,” said Jamie. “I want go sleep again.” “That is ungrateful you, Jamie,” I said, full importance, “when I have come far, night too, set free.” “I am free enough,” said Jamie. “I better supper great deal I home. I do not want go morning.” And he began whimper again. “Do call free?” I said, holding his wrist remnant cord hanging. “Oh!” said Jamie, “that is only--” But ere he got farther moonlight loft darkened. I looked hurriedly towards door. There stood strangest figure, moon behind it. I thought first Kelpie come me, tall woman. My heart gave great jump up, I swallowed down. I would disgrace Jamie. It Kelpie, however, keeper’s sister, great, grim, gaunt woman I seen table supper. I attempt describe her appearance. It peculiar enough, she got bed thrown old shawl her. She pleasant look at. I raised apparition, for, Jamie explained afterwards, cord tied his wrist, instead meant keep prisoner, device her kindness keep frightened. The end tied her wrist, anything happened he might pull her, she would come him. “What is matter, Jamie Duff?” she said gruff voice she advanced along stream moonlight. I stood bravely I could. “It is me, Miss Adam,” I said. “And you?” she returned. “Ranald Bannerman,” I answered. “Oh!” she said puzzled tone. “What time night?” “I came take Jamie home, he will not go.” “You are silly boy think brother John would harm,” she returned. “You are comfortable enough, are not you, Jamie Duff?” “Yes, thank you, madam, quite comfortable,” said Jamie, wide-awake. “But, please madam, Ranald did not mean harm.” “He is housebreaker, though,” she rejoined grim chuckle; “and he would better go home fast he can. If John Adam come out, I do not exactly know might happen. Or perhaps he would like stop keep company.” “No, thank you, Miss Adam,” I said. “I go home.” “Come along, then, let shut door you.” Somewhat nettled Jamie Duff’s indifference well-meant exertions his behalf, I followed her without even bidding good night. “Oh, you have got Missy, you?” she said, spying her she stood. “Would like drink milk piece oatcake go?” “No, thank you,” I said. “I shall glad go bed.” “I think so,” she answered. “Jamie quite comfortable, I assure you; I will take care he is time school morning. There is harm _him_, poor thing!” She undid bridle me, helped mount kindest way, bade good night, stood looking till I distance off. I went home good gallop, took saddle bridle laid cart she would, turned Missy loose stable, shut door, ran across field manse, desiring nothing bed. When I came near house back, I saw figure entering gate front. It full light moon, good way. Before reached door I got behind next corner, peeping round saw first impression correct: Kelpie. She entered, closed door behind her softly. Afraid locked out, danger scarcely occurred before, I hastened her; finding door already fast, I called keyhole. She gave cry alarm, presently opened door, looking pale frightened. “What doors time night?” she asked, without quite her usual arrogance, for, although she tried put on, her voice trembled much. I retorted question. “What yourself?” I said. “Looking you, course.” “That is locked door, I suppose--to keep out.” She answer ready, looked she would struck me. “I shall let father know goings on,” she said, recovering herself little. “You need take trouble. I shall tell breakfast to-morrow morning. I nothing hide. You better tell too.” I said I believe she look me, I thought she locked door annoy me, I wanted take revenge rudeness. For doors seldom locked summer nights part country. She made reply, turned left me, even shutting door. I closed it, went bed weary enough. CHAPTER XXV Turkey Plots The next day, breakfast, I told father previous day’s adventures. Never since he kindly rescued misery wickedness I concealed anything him. He, his part, he gave us every freedom, expected us speak frankly concerning doings. To unwilling let know proceedings would simply argued already disapproved ourselves, second instance yet occurred me. Hence came still I grew older I seemed come nearer father. He us like wiser beautiful self us,--a enlightened conscience, were, ever lifting us towards higher level. This Sunday; he strict his ideas concerning day his parishioners. So long sedate orderly, neither talked laughed loud, he seldom interfered behaviour, sought alter current conversation. I believe he not, like people, require expect us care religious things much he did: could yet know he really were. But doings week referred Sunday, he strict, I think, days, bringing them, involved smallest question, standard right, judged, approved condemned thereby. I believe he thought order ways best preparation receiving higher instruction afterwards. For one thing, then, upon failure, feel burden more, ready repent seek forgiveness God, best help his length makes man good within himself. He listened attentively story, seemed puzzled cry I heard cottage, said nothing could gone wrong, heard it, especially Andrew inquire, laughed apparition Miss Adam, failure rescuing Jamie Duff. He said, however, I right interefere constituted authority--that Adam put protect trees, he got hold harmless person, yet Jamie certainly trespassing, I ought satisfied Turkey’s way looking matter. I saw father right, little reflection convinced that, although conduct root regard Jamie Duff, deeper root regard his sister, one yet deeper regard myself--for I longed show her eyes? I suspect almost silly actions root selfishness, whether take form vanity, conceit, greed, ambition. While I telling tale, Mrs. Mitchell kept coming room oftener, lingering longer, usual. I think till afterwards. I said nothing her, I saw occasion; I doubt she afraid I would, wished hand defend herself. She little friendly church day: she always sat beside little Davie. When came out, I saw Andrew, hurried hear he sped night before. He told he found perfectly quiet cottage, except old woman’s cough, troublesome, gave proof she alive, probably well usual. He suggested noise fancy mine--at I duly indignant, desired know also Missy’s fancy made her go like mad creature. He returned his former idea cock, insult dignity, I let pass, leaning however notion Wandering Willie’s pipes. On following Wednesday half holiday, dinner I went find Turkey farm. He met yard, took barn. “I want speak you, Ranald,” he said. I remember well barn looked day. The upper half one doors hole it, long pencil sunlight streamed in, fell like pool glory upon heap yellow straw. So golden grew straw beneath it, spot looked source shine, sent slanting ray hole door. We sat beside it, I wondering Turkey looked serious important, his will not. “Ranald,” said Turkey, “I cannot bear master bad people him.” “What mean, Turkey?” I rejoined. “I mean Kelpie.” “She is nasty thing, I know,” I answered. “But father considers her faithful servant.” “That is is. She faithful. I have suspected her long time. She is rough ill-tempered she looks honest; I shall able show her yet. You would not call honest cheat poor, would you?” “I think not. But mean?” “There must something put old Eppie ill-temper Saturday, do not think?” “I suppose she sting Kelpie’s tongue.” “No, Ranald, that is it. I heard whispers going about; last Saturday, came home John Adam’s, I told Elsie Jamie, I ran street old Eppie. You would got nothing her, she would liked tell you; she told it.” “What creature are, Turkey! Everybody tells everything.” “No, Ranald; I do not think I gossip that. But chance, ought set right whatever can. Right’s thing, Ranald.” “But are not afraid they will call meddler, Turkey? Not _I_ think so, I am sure anything _against_ anybody, it is _for_ body.” “That would justification I was not right,” said Turkey. “But I am, I am willing bear blame comes it. And I would not meddle anybody could take care himself. But neither old Eppie father that: one’s poor, good.” “I _was_ wondering meant saying father could not take care himself.” “He is good; he is good, Ranald. He believes everybody. _I_ would not kept Kelpie _my_ house half time.” “Did ever say anything Kirsty her?” “I once; she told mind business. Kirsty snubs I laugh her stories. But Kirsty good gold, I would not mind she boxed ears--as indeed she is done--many’s time.” “But what is Kelpie old Eppie?” “First all, Eppie playing her trick.” “Then she must not complain.” “Eppie’s lawful trick, though. The old women laying old heads together--but begin beginning: time growing conviction amongst poor folk Kelpie never gives honest handful meal go rounds. But hard prove, although suspected it, absolutely certain it. So resolved go empty bags. Every one found full handful bottom. Still satisfied. They said she one take care she about. Thereupon old Eppie resolved go something bottom her bag look like good quantity meal already gathered. The moment door closed behind her--that last Saturday--she peeped bag. Not one grain meal discovered. That she passed muttering herself looking angry. Now never manse, places, one poor people cheated dues. But roust yet better proof say anything.” “Well, mean do, Turkey?” I asked. “Why she it, suppose? It is sake saving father’s meal, I think.” “No, she something it, and, I suppose, flatters herself she stealing--only saving poor, making right herself. I cannot help thinking her night something it. Did ever know her go see old Betty?” “No, she does not like her. I know that.” “I am sure. She pretends perhaps. But we will try. I think I outwit her. She is fair game, know.” “How? What? Do tell me, Turkey,” I cried, right eagerly. “Not to-day. I tell by.” He got went his work. CHAPTER XXVI Old John Jamieson As I returned house I met father. “Well, Ranald, about?” he said, his usual gentle tone. “Nothing particular, father,” I answered. “Well, I am going see old man--John Jamieson--I do not think know him: he able come church long time. They tell he dying. Would like go me?” “Yes, father. But will not take Missy?” “Not walk me. It is three miles.” “Very well, father. I like go you.” My father talked various things way. I remember particular remarks he made reading Virgil, I begun Æneid. For one thing, he told I must scan every line I could make sound like poetry, else I neither enjoy properly, fair author. Then he repeated lines Milton, saying first prose, lines ought sounded, making mark difference. Next he opening lines Virgil’s great poem, made feel difference there. “The sound shape it, know, Ranald,” he said, “for poem ear eye. The eye sees sense it; ear sees shape it. To judge poetry without heeding sound it, nearly bad judge rose smelling eyes shut. The sound, besides beautiful thing itself, sense helps out. A psalm tune, it is right one, helps see beautiful psalm is. Every poem carries tune heart, read aloud way bring tune.” I liked Virgil ever much better this, always tried get tune it, every poem I read. “The right way anything,” said father, “may called tune it. We find tune lives. Some people do not seem ever find out, lives broken uncomfortable thing them--full ups downs disappointments, never going meant go.” “But right tune body’s life, father?” “The God, boy.” “But person know that, father?” “By trying he knows already. Everybody different kind tune his life, one find another’s tune him, though he _may_ help find himself.” “But are not read Bible, father?” “Yes, it is order obey it. To read Bible thinking please God mere reading it, think like heathen.” “And are not say prayers, father?” “We ask God want. If do not want thing, acting like pagans speak did, call prayer, think pleasing him.” I silent. My father resumed. “I fancy old man going see found tune _his_ life long ago.” “Is he wise man then, father?” “That depends mean _wise_. _I_ call wise man, find tune truest wisdom. But he is learned man all. I doubt he ever read book Bible, except perhaps Pilgrim’s Progress. I believe he always fond that. _You_ like that--do not you, Ranald?” “I have read good many times, father. But I little tired I got last time.” “But read through--did you--the last time, I mean?” “Oh yes, father. I never like leave loose end thing hanging about.” “That is right, boy; that is right. Well, I think you would better open book long time--say twenty years least. It is great deal good book let get tired of. By time I trust able understand great deal better present.” I felt little sorry I look Pilgrim’s Progress twenty years; I glad now. “We must spoil good books reading much,” father added. “It often better think read them; best never either tired them. We get tired sunlight itself, beautiful is, God send away every night. We are even fit moonlight always. The moon buried darkness every month. And bear nothing length time together, sent sleep every night, may begin fresh morning.” “I see, father, I see,” I answered. We talked came sight John Jamieson’s cottage. What poor little place look at--built clay, hardened sun till one brick! But better place live looked, wind could come walls, although plenty wind about. Three little windows looked eastward rising sun, one south: more. It stood side heathy hill, rose steep behind it, bending round sheltered north. A low wall loose stones enclosed small garden, reclaimed hill, grew greens cabbages potatoes, flower between. In summer pleasant enough, warm sun makes place pleasant. But winter must cold dreary place indeed. There house within sight it. A little brook went cantering hill close end cottage, singing merrily. “It long way sea, nature water find last,” said father, pointing stream crossed single stone bridge. He bend his head low enter cottage. An old woman, sick man’s wife, rose side chimney greet us. My father asked John was. “Wearing away,” her answer. “But he will glad see you.” We turned direction her eyes guided us. The first thing I saw small withered-looking head, next withered-looking hand, large bony. The old man lay bed closed boards, little light fell upon him; his hair glistened silvery gloom. My father drew chair beside him. John looked up, seeing was, feebly held his hand. My father took stroked it, said: “Well, John, man, you have hard life it.” “No harder I could bear,” said John. “It is grand thing able say that,” said father. “Oh sir! matter, I would go again, _his_ will, willingly. I his, sir.” “Well, John, I wish could say same. When man comes that, Lord let us he wants. What want now, John?” “To depart Lord. It would not true, sir, say I was not weary. It seems me, it is Lord’s will, I have enough life. Even death long sleep, people say, till judgment, I think I would rather sleep, I am weary. Only there is old woman there! I do not like leaving her.” “But trust God her too, cannot you?” “It would poor thing I could not, sir.” “Were ever hungry, John--dreadfully hungry, I mean?” “Never longer I could bear,” he answered. “When think it is God, hunger does not get much hold you, sir.” “You must excuse me, John, asking many questions. You know God better I do, I want young man know strong God makes man, old young. He need not care anything else, need he?” “There is nothing else care about, sir. If God done, everything’s right, know. I believe, sir, God cares old woman herself does, she is good wife ever was. Young gentleman, know says God numbers hairs heads? There is many mine left number,” he added faint smile, “but there is plenty yours. You mind God, he will look you. That is way he divides business life.” I saw father’s talk came, view prepare John Jamieson would say. I cannot pretend, however, understood old man time, his words often come back since, helped trials pretty severe, although, like old man, I never found hard bear. “Have child come help wife wait upon you?” father asked. “I ten, sir, three left alive. There will plenty welcome home I go. One three’s Canada, cannot come. Another’s Australia, he cannot come. But Maggie’s far off, she is got leave her mistress come week--only do not want her come till I am nearer end. I like her see last her old father, I shall young next time she sees me, please God, sir. He is all--is not he, sir?” “True, John. If God, things; things his his. But must not weary much. Thank good advice.” “I beg pardon, sir; I intention speaking like that. I never could give advice life. I always found much I could take good advice given me. I like prayed church next Sunday, sir, please.” “But cannot pray yourself, John?” “Yes, sir; I would like spiritual gift friends asked me. Let pray faith me. I want that. The have, want. Do not you, sir? And I might not ask enough myself, I am old tired. I sleep great deal, sir.” “Then do not think God take care give enough, even should not ask enough?” said father. “No doubt that. But see I able think now, I must put things train time I shall not able think it.” Something like John said; although I could understand then, father spoke several times afterwards, I came see old man wanted provide evil time starting prayers heavenward beforehand, were. My father prayed his bedside, pulled parcel two his pocket his wife, walked home together silence. My father man heap words upon words smother thought lay them. He taken sake lesson I might receive, he left strike root mind, he judged likely remained undisturbed. CHAPTER XXVII Turkey’s Trick When came farm way home, looked see Kirsty, found key door, indicating she gone out. As left yard, saw strange-looking woman, appearance beggar, approaching. She wallet her shoulder, walked stooping her eyes ground, lifted greet us--behaviour rarely showed parish. My father took notice, I could help turning look woman. To surprise she stood looking us, moment I turned, she turned also walked on. When I looked she vanished. Of course she must gone farm-yard. Not liking look her, remembering Kirsty out, I asked father whether I better see men stable. He approved, I ran back house. The door still locked. I called Turkey, heard his voice reply one farthest cow-houses. When I reached told story, he asked father knew I come back. When he heard he know, he threw his pitchfork, hastened me. We searched every house place, could find sign whatever woman. “Are sure was not fancy own, Ranald?” said Turkey. “Quite sure. Ask father. She passed near us now.” Turkey hurried away search hayloft more, without success; last I heard father calling me. I ran him, told woman seen. “That is odd,” he said. “She must passed straight yard got side went in. While looking her, she plodding away sight. Come along, let us tea.” I could feel quite satisfied it, but, explanation, I persuaded father right. The next Saturday evening I nursery brothers. It growing dusk, I heard knocking. Mrs. Mitchell seem hear it, I went opened door. There beggar woman. Rather frightened, I called aloud, Mrs. Mitchell came. When she saw beggar, she went back reappeared wooden basin filled meal, she took handful she came apparent preparation dropping it, customary way, woman’s bag. The woman never spoke, closed mouth her wallet, turned away. Curiosity gave courage follow her. She walked long strides direction farm, I kept little distance behind her. She made yard. She escape time. As soon she entered it, I ran fast I could, caught sight her back she went one cow-houses. I darted her. She turned round upon me--fiercely, I thought, judge surprise she held open mouth bag towards me, said-- “Not one grain, Ranald! Put hand feel.” It Turkey. I stared amazement, unable time get rid apparition see reality. Turkey burst laughing perplexed countenance. “Why did not tell before, Turkey?” I asked, able length join laugh. “Because would tell father, I want troubled it, least got things clear. I always _did_ wonder he could keep creature him.” “He does not know her do, Turkey.” “No. She never gives chance. But now, Ranald, could not manage find whether she makes store meal she pretends give away?” A thought struck me. “I heard Davie day asking her she two meal-tubs: perhaps something it.” “You must find out. Do not ask Davie.” For first time occurred Kelpie upon night terror business her own, looking all. “Then she old Betty’s cottage,” said Turkey, I communicated suspicion, “and Wandering Willie too, Andrew right pipes. Willie has not house ever since he took Davie, she gone meet Betty’s. Depend it, Ranald, he is her brother, nephew, something, I used say. I believe she gives meal take home her family somewhere. Did ever hear anything her friends?” “I never heard her speak any.” “Then I do not believe they are respectable. I do not, Ranald. But great trouble minister turn her away. I wonder could not contrive make her go herself. I wish could scare her country. It is nice either woman like innocents Allister Davie.” “She is fond Davie.” “So she is. That is good thing I know her. But hold tongue, Ranald, till find more.” Acting hint Davie given me, I soon discovered second meal-tub. It small, carefully stowed away. It nearly full, every day I watched hope she emptied it, I able find she meal. But Turkey’s suggestion frightening her away kept working brain. CHAPTER XXVIII I Scheme Too I began series persecutions Kelpie account. I doubtful whether Turkey would approve them, I tell time; I ambitious showing I could something without him. I doubt whether worth relate silly tricks I played her--my father made sorry enough afterwards. My excuse is, I hoped drive Kelpie away. There closet hall, floor directly Kelpie’s bed, ceiling between. With gimlet I bored hole floor, I passed piece string. I already got bit black cloth, sewed stuffed something shape rat. Watching opportunity, I tied end string head, hid her bolster. When she going bed, I went closet, and, laying mouth floor, began squeaking like rat, scratching nails. Knowing exclamation she made I attracted her attention, I tugged string; lifted bolster little, course came rat. I heard her scream, open her door. I pulled rat tight ceiling. Then door nursery, slept winter, opened shut, I concluded she gone bed avoid rat. I could hardly sleep pleasure success. As she waited us breakfast next morning, she told father she seen her bed biggest rat she ever saw her life, wink sleep consequence. “Well,” said father, “that comes liking cats. You get pussy take care you.” She grumbled something retired. She removed her quarters nursery. But yet easier plague her. Having observed bed she lay, I passed string rat end middle bar ran across her head, took string along top bed, little hole door. As soon I judged her safe bed, I dropped rat plump. It must fallen near her face. I heard her give loud cry, she could reach door, I fastened string nail got way. It easy days get light, earliest form lucifer match making appearance part country, dear: she go kitchen, fire never went summer winter. Afraid lest her return she search bed, find harmless animal suspended neck, descend upon wrath generated needless terror, I crept room, got rat, pulled away string, escaped. The next morning she said nothing rat, went neighbour’s brought home fine cat. I laughed sleeve, thinking little her cat could protect her rat. Once more, however, she changed her quarters, went sort inferior spare room upper part house, suited operations still better, bed I could manage drop pull rat, drawing away beyond danger discovery. The next night she took cat room her, one I judged prudent leave her alone, next, secured Kirsty’s cat, I turned room she bed: result frightful explosion feline wrath. I thought I might boast successes Turkey, he pleased. “She sure find out, Ranald,” he said, “and whatever else failure. Leave her alone till her quite.” I care linger part story. I little ashamed it. We found length her private reservoir quite full meal. I kept close watch still, finding one night she house, discovered also meal-tub empty. I ran Turkey, together hurried Betty’s cottage. It cloudy night glimpses moonlight. When reached place, heard voices talking, satisfied Kelpie Wandering Willie there. “We must wait till she comes out,” said Turkey. “We must able say saw her.” There great stone standing ground far door, opposite elder-tree, path lay them. “You get behind tree--no, smaller object--you get behind stone, I will get behind tree,” said Turkey; “and Kelpie comes out, make noise like beast, rush her all-fours.” “I am good pig, Turkey,” I said. “Will pig do?” “Yes, well enough.” “But she know me, catch me, Turkey?” “She start away side; I shall rush like mad dog, she will run it.” We waited long time--a long time, seemed me. It well summer. We talked little across, helped beguile weary time; last I said whisper: “Let us go home, Turkey, lock doors, keep her out.” “You go home then, Ranald, I will wait. I do not mind till to-morrow morning. It enough sure ourselves; must able make people sure.” “I will wait long do, Turkey; I am sleepy, she might come I asleep.” “Oh, I shall keep awake!” replied Turkey; settled while. At long last latch door lifted. I falling asleep, sound brought wide awake once. I peeped behind shelter. It Kelpie, empty bag--a pillow-case, I believe--in her hand. Behind her came Wandering Willie, follow her door. The moment favourable, moon thick cloud. Just she reached stone, I rushed hands knees, grunting squeaking like wild pig indeed. As Turkey foretold, she darted aside, I retreated behind stone. The instant Turkey rushed her canine fury, imitation startled even me, expected it. You would thought animal ready tear whole army pieces, complication fierce growls barks squeals he dart unfortunate culprit. She took her heels once, daring make cottage, enemy behind her. But I hardly ensconced behind stone, repressing laughter might, I seized behind Wandering Willie, fear either pig dog. He began pommelling me. “Turkey! Turkey!” I cried. The cry stopped his barking pursuit Kelpie. He rose his feet rushed aid. But he saw state affairs, he turned cottage, crying: “Now kick bagpipes!” Wandering Willie much fool remember understand. He left instantly, made cottage. Turkey drew back let enter, closed door, held it. “Get away bit, Ranald. I run faster Willie. You will sight yards.” But instead coming us, Wandering Willie began playing triumphant tune upon his darling bagpipes. How poor old woman enjoyed it, I know. Perhaps she liked it. For us, set outstrip Kelpie. It matter Turkey, she might lock again. I almost bed I heard her come in. She went straight her room. CHAPTER XXIX A Double Exposure Whether Kelpie recognized us I could tell, much next morning passed doubt over. When she set porridge table, she stood up, and, her fists her sides, addressed father: “I am sorry, sir, make complaints. It is thing I do not like, I am given to. I am sure I try duty Master Ranald well everyone else house.” I felt little confused, I saw clearly enough father could approve proceedings. I whispered Allister-- “Run fetch Turkey. Tell come directly.” Allister always whatever I asked him. He set once. The Kelpie looked suspicious he left room, she pretext interference. I allowed her tell her tale without interruption. After relating exactly served her night before, she gone visit mercy, she represented it, she accused former tricks--that cat having, I presume, enlightened her others; ended saying she protected Turkey, she must leave place. “Let her go, father,” I said. “None us like her.” “I like her,” whimpered little Davie. “Silence, sir!” said father, sternly. “Are things true?” “Yes, father,” I answered. “But please hear _I_‘ve got say. She is told _her_ side it.” “You confessed truth she alleges,” said father. “I think,” he went on, sorrow anger, though good deal both, “that turned bad ways. To think taking death-bed holy man, finding soon playing tricks!--more like mischievousness monkey human being!” “I do not say right, father; I am sorry I offended you.” “You _have_ offended me, deeply. You unkind indeed cruel good woman done her best many years!” I much abashed take notice Kelpie bridled this. “I cannot say I am sorry I have done her,” I said. “Really, Ranald, impertinent. I would send room once, must beg Mrs. Mitchell’s pardon first, something say, I fear.” “But, father, heard story yet.” “Well--go on. It fair, I suppose, hear sides. But nothing justify conduct.” I began trembling voice. I gone mind night I would say, knowing better tell tale beginning circumstantially. Before I ended, Turkey made his appearance, ushered Allister. Both breath running. My father stopped me, ordered Turkey away I finished. I ventured look Kelpie twice. She grown white, grew whiter. When Turkey left room, she would gone too. But father told her she must stay hear end. Several times she broke out, accusing telling pack wicked lies, father told her she opportunity defending herself, she must interrupt me. When I done, he called Turkey, made tell story. I need hardly say that, although he questioned us closely, he found discrepancy accounts. He turned last Mrs. Mitchell, who, her rage, would abject condition. “Now, Mrs. Mitchell!” he said. She nothing reply beyond asserting Turkey I always hated persecuted her, told pack lies agreed upon, ruin her, poor lone woman, friends take her part. “I think likely could wicked,” said father. “So I am wicked person world! Very well, sir! I leave house day.” “No, no, Mrs. Mitchell; will not do. One party _is_ wicked--that clear; greatest consequence find which. If go, I shall know you, taken tried stealing. Meantime I shall go round parish. I think poor people combined lie you.” “They hate me,” said Kelpie. “And why?” asked father. She made answer. “I must get truth it,” said father. “You go now.” She left room without another word, father turned Turkey. “I surprised you, Turkey, lending silly pranks. Why come tell me.” “I sorry, sir. I afraid would troubled finding wicked she was, I thought might frighten her away somehow. But Ranald began his tricks without letting know, I saw mine could use, she would suspect his. Mine would better, sir.” “I doubt it, equally unjustifiable. And well he acted part four-footed animal last night.” “I confess I yielded temptation then, I knew could good. It pleasure frightening her. It foolish me, I beg pardon, sir.” “Well, Turkey, I confess vexed me, trying find wrong she whole parish, taking whole thing hands. It worse you, inasmuch older far wiser Ranald. It worse Ranald I his father. I try show wrong done.--Had told without anything yourselves, I might succeeded bringing Mrs. Mitchell repentance. I could reasoned her matter, shown her she merely thief, thief worst kind, Judas robbed poor, robbed God. I could shown her cruel she was--” “Please, sir,” interrupted Turkey, “I do not think she herself. I believe,” he went on, father listened, “that Wandering Willie relation hers. He poor person, almost person except Davie, I ever saw her behave kindly to. He last night, also, I fancy, time, Ranald got fright. She poor relations somewhere, sends meal Willie. You remember, sir, old clothes Allister’s found wanted Jamie Duff.” “You may right, Turkey--I dare say right. I hope are, though bad enough, would quite bad herself.” “I sorry, father,” I said; “I beg pardon.” “I hope lesson you, boy. After done, rousing every bad angry passion her, I fear use try make her sorry repent. It her, me, done wrong. I nothing complain myself--quite contrary. But dreadful thing throw difficulties way repentance turning evil works.” “What I make it?” I sobbed. “I do not see moment do. I turn mind. You may go now.” Thereupon Turkey I walked away, I school, he his cattle. The lecture father given us forgotten. Turkey looked sad, I felt subdued concerned. Everything father heard confirmed tale told him. But Kelpie frustrated whatever he may resolved upon regard her: he returned she disappeared. How she managed get her chest away, I cannot tell. I think she must hid outhouse, fetched next night. Many little things missed house afterwards, nothing great value, neither she Wandering Willie ever appeared again. We satisfied poor old Betty knew nothing her conduct. It easy enough deceive her, she alone her cottage, waited upon neighbour visited her certain times day. My father, I heard afterwards, gave five shillings his pocket every one poor people Kelpie defrauded. Her place house was, endless happiness, taken Kirsty, faithfully she carried father’s instructions that, along sacred handful meal, penny given every one parish poor time forward, long he lived manse. Not even little Davie cried he found Mrs. Mitchell really gone. It his affection her kindness attached her. Thus last delivered Kelpie. CHAPTER XXX Tribulation After expulsion Kelpie, accession Kirsty, things went peaceably, whole time rests memory like summer evening sundown. I therefore little say concerning home-life. There two schools little town--the first, parish school, master appointed presbytery; second, one chiefly upheld dissenters place, master appointed parents scholars. This difference, however, indicated little distinction separation would involved England. The masters licentiates established church, order vague resemblance deacons English church; scholars whose fees paid parish, others preparing University; many pupils second school whose parents took established church Sundays, yearly examined presbytery--that is, clergymen certain district; father friendly terms parents, come his church thought expenses religion met offerings prized ministrations, others regarded unity nation, thought religion, like necessities, ought care chosen government. I think second school would ever come existence except requirements population, one school insufficient. There little real schism matter, except boys themselves. They made far parents, occasional outbreak consequence. At time second school certain rough lad, least developed beyond brute, perhaps, scholars village. It amazing see close brute man may remain see far he may leave brute behind. How began I cannot recall; youth, lad seventeen, whether moved dislike mere fascination injury, habit teasing beyond verge endurance often he chance. I like complain father, though would better hate I did. I ashamed impotence self-defence; therein I little blame, I half his size, certainly half his strength. My pride forbidding flight, probability was, met out-of-the-way quarter, he would block path half hour least, pull hair, pinch cheeks, everything annoy me, short leaving marks violence upon me. If met street, people sight, he would pass wink grin, much say--_Wait_. One short fierce wars rival schools broke out. What originated individual quarrel I cannot tell. I doubt anyone knew. It endured day, however, came pitched battle school hours. The second school considerably smaller, advantage perched top low, steep hill bottom lay ours. Our battles always began missiles; I wonder, often I recall fact, serious accidents consequence. From disadvantages ground, little chance stone-showers descended upon us like hail, except charged right hill, face inferior well-posted enemy. When favour moment, I employed collecting stones supplying companions, seemed every boy, smallest either school, skilful throwing them, except myself: I could throw halfway hill. On occasion, however, I began fancy unworthy exercise fighting powers, made first attempt organizing troop up-hill charge. I tall boy, influence amongst age. Whether enemy saw intent proceeded forestall it, I cannot say, certainly charge never took place. A house importance building, top hill, sort hand-wagon, lorry low wheels, use moving large stones employed, chips dressing us formidable missiles. Our adversaries laid hold chariot, turned engine war. They dragged top hill, jumped upon it, many would hold, and, drawn weight, came thundering upon troops. Vain storm stones assailed advance: could stopped would. My company open make way advancing prodigy, conspicuous upon towered personal enemy Scroggie. “Now,” I called men, “as soon thing stops, rush seize them: they are half number. It endless disgrace let go.” Whether courage carry design fortune favoured us, I cannot tell. But soon chariot reached part hill slope less, turned little one side, Scroggie fell off, drawing half load him. My men rushed shouts defiant onset, arrested non-resistance foe. I sprung seize Scroggie. He tried get up, fell back groan. The moment I saw his face, mood changed. My hatred, without wish effort mine, turned pity something better. In moment I knees beside him. His face white, drops stood upon his forehead. He lay half upon his side, one hand he scooped handfuls dirt road threw again. His leg broken. I got lean his head me, tried make lie comfortably; moment I sought move leg he shrieked out. I sent one swiftest runners doctor, meantime best I could him. He took matter course, even thank me. When doctor came, got mattress neighbouring house, laid wagon, lifted Scroggie top, dragged hill home his mother. I said little, little, concerning master, Mr. Wilson. At last examination I had, compliance request one clergymen, read aloud metrical composition own, sent way essay given subject, _Patriotism_, he shown great increase favour. Perhaps he recognized germ literary faculty--I cannot tell: never come much he did, he must greatly disappointed me, seeing I labour living words, dead stones. I certain, though, whether I build good bad houses, I built worse I insight he gave literature nature literary utterance. I read Virgil Horace him, scanned every doubtful line came across. I sometimes think now, certain successful men want make real artists, simply knowledge literature--which essence possible art--of country. My brother Tom left school, gone county town, receive final preparation University; consequently, far school concerned, I longer position younger brother. Also Mr. Wilson discovered I faculty imparting knowledge I possessed, begun make use teaching others. A good deal done way Scotch schools. Not least attempt system it: master, moment, would choose one he thought fit, set teach class, he attended individuals, taught another class himself. Nothing better verification knowledge, discovery ignorance, attempt teach. In case led unforeseen results well. The increasing trust master reposed me, increasing favour openly accompanied it, stimulated growth natural vanity, length appeared form presumption, and, I little doubt, although I unaware time, influenced whole behaviour school-fellows. Hence arose complaint I favourite master, accusation I used underhand means recommend him, I yet aware I ever guilty. My presumption I confess, wonder master take earlier measures check it. When teaching class, I would unfrequently, Mr. Wilson vacated his chair, climb it, sit I master school. I even went far deposit books master’s desk, instead recess. But I least suspicion indignation I thus rousing me. One afternoon I class history. They read badly, seemed wilful blundering; came questioning subject lesson, I soon saw conspiracy. The answers gave invariably wrong, generally absurd, sometimes utterly grotesque. I ought except girls, best, apparently knew nothing design others. One two girls, however, infected spirit game, soon outdid whole class wildness replies. This last got better me; I lost temper, threw book, retired seat, leaving class stood. The master called asked reason. I told truth matter. He got angry, called several bigger boys punished severely. Whether supposed I mentioned particular, I not, I know; I could read faces vowed vengeance hearts. When school broke up, I lingered last, hope would go home usual; I came master, saw silent waiting groups, evident thunder moral atmosphere would admit easy discharge. The master come conclusion, instead turning towards his house, he walked part way home, without alluding however reason. Allister us, I led Davie hand: his first week school life. When got half distance, believing quite safe, he turned footpath went fields back towards town; we, delivered immediate apprehension, jogged homewards. When gone distance farther, I happened look about--why, I could tell. A crowd following us full speed. As soon saw discovered them, broke silence shout, followed patter many footsteps. “Run, Allister!” I cried; kneeling, I caught Davie back, ran feet fear. Burdened thus, Allister soon far ahead me. “Bring Turkey!” I cried him. “Run farm hard pelt, bring Turkey meet us.” “Yes, yes, Ranald,” shouted Allister, ran yet faster. They getting us quite fast wished; began therefore pick stones ran, soon heard hailing road behind us. A little farther, stones began go bounding past us, I dared longer carry Davie back. I stop, lost us time, shift arms, made running much harder. Davie kept calling, “Run, Ranald!--here come!” jumping so, half fear, half pleasure, I found hard work indeed. Their taunting voices reached length, loaded sorts taunting opprobrious words--some them, I dare say, deserved, all. Next stone struck me, dangerous place, though crippled running still more. The bridge sight, however, I could get rid Davie turn bay, small wooden bridge, rails narrow gate end keep horsemen riding it. The foremost pursuers within yards heels, when, last effort, I bounded it; I time set Davie turn bar way shutting gate, reached it. I breath left enough cry, “Run, Davie!” Davie, however, notion state affairs, run, stood behind staring. So I much better yet. If he run, I seen far enough way home, I would taken water, pretty deep, I would run risk getting hold me. If I could reached mill opposite bank, shout would brought miller aid. But long I could prevent opening gate, I thought I could hold position. There latch secure it, I pulled thin knife pocket, I received blow face first arrival knocked backwards, I jammed latch iron staple worked. Before first attempt open followed discovery obstacle, I up, next moment, well-directed kick, disabled fingers fumbling remove it. To protect latch main object, efforts would quite useless, twenty would top instant. Help, however, although unrecognized such, making way ranks enemy. They parted asunder, Scroggie, still lame, strode heavily gate. Recalling nothing his old enmity, I turned implored Davie. “Do run, Davie, dear! it is up,” I said; entreaties lost upon Davie. Turning despair, I saw lame leg hoisted gate. A shudder ran me: I could _not_ kick leg; I sprang hit Scroggie hard face. I might well hit block granite. He swore me, caught hold hand, turning assailants said: “Now, off! This little business. I will him!” Although far enough obeying his orders, willing turn enemy, hung back expectant. Meantime lame leg one side gate, splints sharpened points, sound leg upon other. I, one side--for he let go hand order support himself--retreated little, stood upon defensive, trembling, I must confess; enemies side could reach long Scroggie upon top gate. The lame leg went searching gently about, could find rest sole foot, projecting cross bar upon side; repose upon top anything perfect, leg suspended behind useless. The long short, legs results, was, Scroggie stuck; long he stuck, I safe. As soon I saw this, I turned caught Davie, thinking make home more. But instant rush gate; Scroggie hoisted over, knife taken out, poured assailants, I quite reached end bridge. “At them, Oscar!” cried voice. The dog rushed past bridge, followed Turkey. I set Davie down, and, holding his hand, breathed again. There scurry rush, splash two water, back came Oscar his innocent tongue hanging like blood-red banner victory. He followed Scroggie, exploding laughter. Oscar came wagging his tail, looking pleased he restored obedience flock unruly sheep. I shrank back Scroggie, wishing Turkey, still end bridge, would make haste. “Was not fun, Ranald?” said Scroggie. “You do not think I lame I could not get gate? I stuck purpose.” Turkey joined us inquiring look, he knew Scroggie habit treating me. “It is right, Turkey,” I said. “Scroggie stuck gate purpose.” “A good thing you, Ranald!” said Turkey. “Did not see Peter Mason amongst them?” “No. He left school last year.” “He there, though, I do not suppose _he_ meant agreeable.” “I tell what,” said Scroggie: “if like, I will leave school come yours. My mother let us I like.” I thanked him, said I think would it. It would blow over. Allister told father much he knew affair; he questioned me, I told much I knew. The next morning, settling work, father entered school. The hush followed intense. The place might absolutely empty sound I could hear seconds. The ringleaders enemies held heads, anticipating outbreak vengeance. But moments’ conversation Mr. Wilson, father departed. There mystery proceeding, unknown possibility result, sedative effect whole morning. When broke dinner, Mr. Wilson detained me, told father thought better that, time least, I occupy prominent position before. He sorry, he said, I great help him; I object, he would ask father allow assist evening-school winter. I delighted prospect, sank back natural position, met annoyance. After I able assure former foes I voice bringing punishment upon particular, enmity was, I believe, quite extinguished. When winter came, evening-school opened, Mr. Wilson called manse, father willingly assented proposed arrangement. The scholars mostly young men neighbouring farms, workshops village, whom, although I much younger they, danger jealousy. The additional assistance would thus receive, respect superior knowledge, which, advantages, I credit them, would prevent false shame inferiority years. There girls school well--among rest, Elsie Duff. Although her grandmother feeble, Elsie able little her way, real reason old woman left hour two evening. I need hardly say Turkey regular attendant. He always, I often, saw Elsie home. My chief pleasure lay helping her her lessons. I best assist wanted aid, offered unsolicited attention her. She quick, would never satisfied she understood, superiority gifts. Hence, her progress slow, unintermitting. Turkey far trigonometry, I able help grammar geography, he commenced Latin, he winter, I assisted good deal. Sometimes Mr. Wilson would ask go home school, take supper. This made late, father mind it, he liked Mr. Wilson. I learned good deal times. He excellent little library, would take his favourite books read passages. It wonderful things which, reading ourselves, might pass half-blind manner, gain true power influence voice one sees feels them. If man confidence merely lays his finger paragraph says you, “Read that,” probably discover three times much would chanced upon course reading. In case mind gathers up, eyes ears. But Mr. Wilson would sometimes read verses his own; delight I rarely experienced. My reader may wonder full-grown man good scholar condescend treat boy like much equal; sympathy precious even child, Mr. Wilson companions his standing. I believe he read Turkey me, however. As I apologized already introduction his verses Scotch words them, I venture try whether apology cover second offence sort.

There tremendous fall snow, furious wind, lasting two days night between, drifted great mounds, shape country much altered new heights hollows. Even best acquainted could guess direction roads, easiest thing world lose right track, even broad daylight. As soon storm over, however, frost found likely continue, begun cut passages deeper wreaths, called snow-mounds; tops others, along general line frequented roads, footpaths soon trodden. It many days, however, vehicles could pass, coach-communication resumed towns. All short day, sun, though low, brilliant, whole country shone dazzling whiteness; sunset, took place three four of the clock, anything dreary hardly imagined, especially keenest winds rushed gusts north-east, lifting snow-powder untrodden shadows, blew it, like many stings, face freezing traveller. Early one afternoon, I came home school, winter always three of the clock, father received message certain laird, _squire_ he would called England--whose house lay three four miles amongst hills, point death, anxious see him: groom horseback brought message. The old man led life indifferent repute, probably made anxious see father, proceeded get ready uninviting journey. Since brother Tom’s departure, I become yet companion father; I saw preparing set out, I begged allowed go him. His little black mare daughter, unused saddle. She almost twice her mother’s size, none less clumsy she chiefly employed upon farm. Still she touch roadster her, capable elegant motion, could get ground well enough, sort speedy slouch, while, far consequence expedition like present, she great strength, could go wreaths, Andrew said, like red-hot iron. My father hesitated, looked sky, hesitated still. “I hardly know say, Ranald. If I sure weather--but I doubtful. However, break up, stay night. Yes.--Here, Allister; run tell Andrew saddle mares, bring directly.--Make haste dinner, Ranald.” Delighted prospect, I make haste; meal soon over, Kirsty expended her utmost care clothing journey, would certainly much longer one regard time space. In half hour mounted way--the groom, lately traversed road, yards front. I already said, perhaps once, father took comparatively little notice us children, beyond teaching us Sunday, sometimes week-evening winter, generally bed. He rarely fondled us, anything supply manner loss mother. I believe his thoughts tenderness towards us, show ordinary shape: connecting link absent. It seems sometimes, perhaps he wisely retentive his feelings, waited better time let flow. For, ever grew older, drew nearer father, or, properly, father drew us nearer him, dropping, degrees, reticence which, perhaps, many parents character keep children full grown; time he would converse freely. I presume he found, believed he found trustworthy, incapable repeating unwisely remarks he made. But much he hated certain kinds gossip, he believed indifference neighbour his affairs worse. He said everything depended spirit men spoke other; much called gossip natural love biography, and, kindly, better blameless; greater part objectionable, simply loving, curious; portion amongst wickedest things earth, object believe make others believe worst. I mention opinions father, lest anyone misjudge fact his talking he did. Our horses made slow progress. It almost nowhere possible trot, plod on, step step. This made easy converse. “The country looks dreary, does not it, Ranald?” he said. “Just like everything dead, father,” I replied. “If sun cease shining altogether, think would happen?” I thought bit, prepared answer, father spoke again. “What makes seeds grow, Ranald--the oats, wheat, barley?” “The rain, father,” I said, half-knowledge. “Well, sun, vapours would rise make clouds. What rain already sky would come snow lumps ice. The earth would grow colder colder, harder harder, last went sweeping air, one frozen mass, hard stone, without green leaf living creature upon it.” “How dreadful think of, father!” I said. “That would frightful.” “Yes, boy. It sun life world. Not he make rain rise fall seeds earth, even would useless, he make warm well--and something else besides cannot understand. Farther earth rays light reach, he sends rays cannot see, go searching it, like long fingers; wherever find touch seed, life seed begins talk itself, were, straightway begins grow. Out dark earth he thus brings lovely green things spring, clothes world beauty, sets waters running, birds singing, lambs bleating, children gathering daisies butter-cups, gladness overflowing hearts--very different see now--is not it, Ranald?” “Yes, father; body hardly believe, look now, world ever like again.” “But, cold wretched looks, sun forsaken it. He drawn away little, good reasons, one may learn cannot without him. If he go, one breath could one us draw. Horses men, drop frozen lumps, hard stones. Who sun’s father, Ranald?” “He has not got father,” I replied, hoping answer riddle. “Yes, he has, Ranald: I prove that. You remember apostle James calls Father Lights?” “Oh yes, course, father. But does not mean another kind lights?” “Yes. But could not called lights like sun. All kinds lights must come Father Lights. Now Father sun must like sun, and, indeed material things, sun likest God. We pray God shine upon us give us light. If God shine hearts, would dead lumps cold. We should not care anything whatever.” “Then, father, God never stops shining upon us. He would not like sun he did. For even winter sun shines enough keep us alive.” “True, boy. I glad understand me. In experience I never yet known man whose heart I could find proofs shining great Sun. It might feeble wintry shine, still he there. For human heart though, dreadful cold, white winter like inside it, instead summer colour warmth light. There is poor old man going see. They talk winter age: that is well, heart made winter. A man may snow his roof, merry children his hearth; he may grey hairs his head, gladness summer his bosom. But old man, I afraid, feels wintry cold within.” “Then does not Father Lights shine make warmer?” “The sun shining much earth winter summer: earth warmer?” “Because,” I answered, calling little astronomy I knew, “that part turned away sun.” “Just so. Then man turns away Father Lights--the great Sun--how he warmed?” “But earth cannot help it, father.” “But man can, Ranald. He feels cold, he knows he turn light. Even poor old man knows now. God shining him--a wintry way--or he would feel cold all; he would lump ice, part winter itself. The good warmth God gives is, he feels cold. If he cold, he could not feel cold.” “Does he want turn Sun, then, father?” “I know. I know he miserable he turned Sun.” “What say him, father?” “I cannot tell, boy. It depends I find thinking. Of things, boy, keep face Sun. You cannot shine yourself, cannot good yourself, God made able turn Sun whence goodness shining comes. God’s children may naughty, must able turn towards him. The Father Lights Father every weakest little baby good thought us, well highest devotion martyrdom. If turn face Sun, boy, soul will, come die, feel like autumn, golden fruits earth hanging rich clusters ready gathered--not like winter. You may feel ever worn, feel withered. You die peace, hoping spring--and spring!” Thus talking, course two hours arrived dwelling old laird. CHAPTER XXXII The Peat-Stack How dreary old house looked approached gathering darkness! All light appeared come snow rested wherever could lie--on roofs window ledges turrets. Even windward walls, every little roughness sustained frozen patch, grey spotted whiteness. Not glimmer shone windows. “Nobody lives _there_, father,” I said,--“surely?” “It look lively,” he answered. The house stood upon bare knoll. There tree within sight. Rugged hills arose sides it. Not sound heard moan occasional gust wind. There brook, lay frozen beneath yards snow. For miles direction gusts might wander without shaking door window, carrying puff smoke hearth. We crossing yard back house, towards kitchen-door, front door opened months, recognized first sign life. That low bullock. As dismounted feet rough pavement swept clear, old woman came door, led us dreary parlour without even fire welcome us. I learned afterwards laird, spendthrift his youth, become miser his age, every household arrangement narrowest scale. From wasting righteous pounds, he come scraping unrighteous farthings. After remained standing time, housekeeper returned, invited father go laird’s room. As went, he requested her take kitchen, which, conducting him, she did. The sight fire, although smallest, welcome. She laid peats upon it, encouraged blaze, remarking, sidelong look: “We dare not this, see, sir, laird about. The honest man would call waste.” “Is he dying?” I asked, sake saying something; she shook her head reply, and, going press end large, vault-like kitchen, brought milk basin, oatcake upon platter, saying, “It is house, see, I would something better set minister’s son.” I glad food however, well I ate heartily. I got quite warm also father stepped kitchen, solemn, stood his back fire. The old woman set chair, he neither sat accepted refreshment she humbly offered him. “We must going,” he objected, “for looks stormy, sooner set better.” “I am sorry I cannot ask stop night,” she said, “for I could not make comfortable. There is nothing fit offer house, there is bed that is slept I do not know long.” “Never mind,” said father cheerfully. “The moon already, shall get home I trust snow begins fall. Will tell man get horses out?” When she returned taking message, she came father said, loud whisper, “Is he bad way, sir?” “He dying,” answered father. “I know that,” she returned. “He will gone morning. But that is I meant. Is he bad way world? That is I meant, sir.” “Well, good woman, life like his, glad remember Lord told us--not judge. I think he ashamed sorry his past life. But it is wrong he done former time stands half much his way his present fondness he counts his own. It seems like break his heart leave his little bits property--particularly money he saved; yet he hope Jesus Christ kind enough pardon him. I afraid he find miserable though, he one scrap left call his own--not pocket-knife even.” “It is dreadful think flying air night like this,” said she. “My good woman,” returned father, “we know nothing departed spirit exists left body. But seems dreadful without God world, without anywhere else. Let us pray God may wherever he is.” So saying, father knelt down, beside him, he prayed earnestly God old man. Then rose, mounted horses, rode away. We halfway home, clouds began cover moon, snow began fall. Hitherto got pretty well, light enough see track, feeble was. Now, however, keep careful lookout. We pressed horses, went bravely, slow work best. It got darker darker, clouds went gathering, snow coming huge dull flakes. Faster thicker came, length could see nothing road us, compelled leave wisdom horses. My father, great confidence his little mare, carried many doubtful difficult place, rode first. I followed close behind. He kept talking cheerfully--I thought since--to prevent getting frightened. But I thought fear. To father perfect safety. He act telling how, occasions one, Missy got places road impassable, walking tops walls, horses plunged gulf snow. The mare struggled, deeper sank it. For moment I thought closing head. “Father! father!” I shouted. “Do not frightened, boy,” cried father, his voice seeming come far away. “We God’s hands. I cannot help now, soon Missy got quieter, I shall come you. I think I know whereabouts are. We have dropped right road. You are hurt, you?” “Not least,” I answered. “I frightened.” A moments more, mare lay rather stuck quiet, her neck head thrown back, her body deep snow. I put hands feel. It rose head farther I could reach. I got clear stirrups scrambled up, first knees, feet. Standing thus upon saddle, I stretched hands head, still broken wall snow ascended reach. I could see nothing father, I heard talking Missy. My mare soon began floundering again, I tumbled sides hole, grew terrified lest I bring snow down. I therefore cowered upon mare’s back she quiet again. “Woa! Quiet, lass!” I heard father saying, seemed his Missy frightened mine. My fear quite gone, I felt much inclined laugh fun misadventure. I yet idea serious thing might be. Still I sense enough see something must done--but what? I saw way getting hole except trampling snow upon back poor mare, I could think of; I doubted much whether father even could tell direction turn help shelter. Finding way home, even got free, seemed question. Again mare began plunging violently, time I found thrown hard substance. I thrust hand snow, felt I thought stones one dry walls common country. I might clear away enough snow climb upon that; next--it dark? “Ranald!” cried father; “how get on?” “Much same, father,” I answered. “I am wreath,” he returned. “We have come side. You better I suspect, however. The snow warmer air. It beginning blow. Pull feet get right upon mare’s back.” “That is I am, father--lying her back, pretty comfortable,” I rejoined. All time snow falling thick. If went like this, I buried morning, fact wind rising added danger it. We wrong end night too. “I am kind ditch, I think, father,” I cried--the place fell one side stone wall other.” “That hardly be, I should not got out,” he returned. “But I have got Missy quiet, I will come you. I must get out, I see, snowed up. Woa, Missy! Good mare! Stand still.” The next moment he gave joyous exclamation. “What it, father?” I cried. “It is stone wall; it is peat-stack. That _is_ good.” “I do not see good is. We cannot light fire.” “No, boy; there is peat-stack, there is probably house.” He began uttering series shouts top his voice, listening response. This lasted good while. I began get cold. “I am nearly frozen, father,” I said, “and what is become poor mare--she is got clothes on?” “I will get out, boy; least able move little.” I heard shovelling snow his hands feet. “I got corner stack, well I judge must round it,” he said. “Your voice close me,” I answered. “I have got hold one mare’s ears,” he said next. “I will not try get her I get her.” I put hand, felt along mare’s neck. What joy catch father’s hand darkness snow! He grasped mine drew towards him, got arm began dragging snow. The mare began plunging again, her struggles rather assisted father. In moments he his arms. “Thank God!” he said, he set peat-stack. “Stand there. A little farther. Keep well fear she hurt you. She must fight her way now.” He went back mare, went clearing away snow. Then I could hear patting encouraging her. Next I heard great blowing scrambling, last snort thunder hoofs. “Woa! woa! Gently! gently!--She is off!” cried father. Her mother gave one snort, away she went, thundering her. But sounds soon quenched snow. “There is business!” said father. “I am afraid poor things go farther fare worse. We well without them, however; find way home, much better us. They might kept us little warmer though. We must fight cold best rest night, would folly leave spot light enough see going.” It came mind suddenly I burrowed straw hide running Dame Shand’s. But whether thought burrowing peat-stack came first, I cannot tell. I turned felt whether I could draw peat. With little loosening I succeeded. “Father,” I said, “could not make hole peat-stalk, build in?” “A capital idea, boy!” he answered, gladness his voice I venture attribute part his satisfaction finding I practical sense me. “We will try once.” “I have got two three already,” I said, I gone pulling, easy enough one started. “We must take care do not bring whole stack though,” said father. “Even then,” I returned, “we could build them, would something.” “Right, Ranald! It would making houses shape, instead big enough move in--turning crustaceous animals, know.” “It would peat-greatcoat least,” I remarked, pulling away. “Here,” he said, “I put stick top row. That sort lintel support above.” He always carried his walking-stick whether he rode walked. We worked will, piling peats little front might build door cave inside. We got quite merry it. “We shall brought magistrates destruction property,” said father. “You will send Andrew build stack again--that is all.” “But I wonder nobody hears us. How peat-stack far house?” “I cannot imagine,” I said; “except prevent burning many peats. It like trick poor laird anybody else.” Every would come rush, long made large hole. We left good thick floor sit upon. Creeping in, commenced building entrance. We proceeded far, however, found cave small, remain hours, must find cramped. Therefore, instead using peats already pulled out, finished building wall others fresh drawn inside. When length had, best ability, completed immuring, sat wait morning--my father calm he seated his study-chair, I state condensed delight; grand adventure--with father share it, keep going far? He sat his back leaning side hole, I sat his knees, leaned him. His arms folded round me; could ever boy blessed I then? The sense outside danger; knowledge wind rose, might walled snow morning; assurance present safety good hope--all made impression upon mind ever since trouble threatened me, I invariably turned first thought memory harbour refuge storm. There I sat long hours secure father’s arms, knew soundless snow falling thick around us, marked occasionally threatening wail wind like cry wild beast scenting us afar. “This grand, father,” I said. “You would like better home bed, would not you?” he asked, trying me. “No, indeed, I not,” I answered, honesty; I felt exuberantly happy. “If keep warm,” said father. “If get cold indeed, must lose heart, man, think pleasant get home good fire hot breakfast.” “I think I bear right. I often cold enough school.” “This may worse. But need anticipate evil: send suffering. It well prepared it, ill brood fancied future evil. In life, boy--and I like remember I say--I never found trial go beyond I could bear. In worst cases suffering, I think help given look cannot understand, enables sufferer endure. The last help kind death, I think always blessing, though people regard such.” I listened wonder. Without able see he said true, I could yet accept vague fashion. “This nest made shelter us,” he resumed, “brings mind Psalmist says dwelling secret place Most High. Everyone will, may there, like swallow, make nest.” “This cannot like that, though, surely, father,” I ventured object. “Why not, boy?” “It is safe enough, one thing.” “You right there. Still like. It place refuge.” “The cold get it, father.” “But keeps minds peace. Even refuge God always secure us external suffering. The heart may quite happy strong hands benumbed cold. Yes, heart even may grow cold coming death, man retreats farther secret place Most High, growing calm hopeful last cold invades house his body. I believe troubles come drive us refuge--that secret place alone safe. You will, go world, boy, find men believe this, believe believe it. They regard best fantastic weakness, fit sickly people. But watch strength people, calmness common sense, fares grasp suffering lays hold upon them. It sad sight--that abject hopeless misery I saw afternoon. If his mind indication reality, one must said God--no God least would anything him. The universe reflected tarnished mirror his soul, chill misty void, blew moaning wind unknown fate. As near ever I saw it, man without God without hope world. All done mightiest things--I mean showiest things--all like William Orange--the great William, I mean, King William--or John Milton, William Penn, cloud witnesses spoken Epistle Hebrews--all men I say done mightiest things, believed refuge God, less entered secret place Most High. There could found strength mighty deeds. They able knew God wanted them, he side, rather his side, therefore safe, surrounded God every side. My boy, God--that is, know believe right, fear nothing.” I never forgot lesson. But readers must think father often talked like this. He favourable much talk religion. He used say much talk prevented much thought, talk without thought bad. Therefore part upon extraordinary occasions, example, he spoke deep simplicities faith God root his conscious life. He silent utterance, lasted longer I represented, although unbroken, I believe, remark mine. Full inward repose, I fell asleep his arms. When I awoke I found cold. Then I became aware father asleep, first time began uneasy. It cold: unendurable; night lay awful white silence me, wind moaning outside, blowing long thin currents peat walls around me, warm home lay far away, I could tell many hours cold darkness yet pass could set find it,--it things together, that, midst these, I awake father slept. I could easily waked him, I selfish enough that: I sat still shivered felt dreary. Then last words father began return upon me, and, throb relief, thought awoke mind although father asleep, great Father us both, he whose heart lay secret place refuge, neither slumbered slept. And I able wait patience, idea, sense present care God, I never before. When, years, father taken us, thought night came again, I would say heart: “My father sleeps I may know better The Father wakes.” At length he stirred. The first sign his awaking was, he closed arms dropped his sides he slept. “I am glad you are awake, father,” I said, speaking first. “Have _you_ long awake then?” “Not long, I felt lonely without you.” “Are cold? _I_ feel rather chilly.” So chatted away while. “I wonder nearly day yet. I least know long slept. I wonder watch going. I forgot wind last night. If stopped I shall know near daylight.” He held his watch his ear: alas! ticking vigorously. He felt keyhole, wound up. After employed repeating many metrical psalms paraphrases Scripture could recollect, helped away good part weary time. But went slowly, I growing cold I could hardly bear it. “I am afraid feel cold, Ranald,” said father, folding closer his arms. “You must try go sleep again, would dangerous now. I feel cramped cold.” As he said this, he extended his legs threw his head back, get rid uneasiness stretching himself. The moment, came shower peats upon heads bodies, I tried move, I found fixed. I could help laughing. “Father,” I cried, soon I could speak, “you are like Samson: you have brought house upon us.” “So I have, boy. It thoughtless me. I do not know _are_ now.” “Can move, father? _I_ cannot,” I said. “I move legs, I am afraid move even toe boot fear bringing another avalanche peats. But no--there is much danger that: already, I feel snow face.” With hands feet father struggled, could much, I lay great heap. His struggles made opening sideways however. “Father! father! shout,” I cried. “I see light somewhere; I think moving.” We shouted loud could, lay listening. My heart beat I afraid I hear reply might come. But next moment rang frosty air. “It is Turkey! That is Turkey, father!” I cried. “I know his shout. He makes go farther anybody else.--Turkey! Turkey!” I shrieked, almost weeping delight. Again Turkey’s cry rang darkness, light drew wavering nearer. “Mind step, Turkey,” cried father. “There is hole may tumble into.” “It would not hurt much snow,” I said. “Perhaps not, he would probably lose his light, hardly afford.” “Shout again,” cried Turkey. “I cannot make are.” My father shouted. “Am I coming nearer now?” “I hardly say. I cannot see well. Are going along road?” “Yes. Cannot come me?” “Not yet. We cannot get out. We are upon right hand, peat-stack.” “Oh! I know peat-stack. I will moment.” He however find easily he expected, peats covered snow. My father gave trying free took laughing instead ridiculous situation discovered. He kept directing Turkey, however, length disappearances made us anxious lantern, caught sight stack, walked straight towards it. Now first saw he alone, accompanied silent Andrew. “Where you, sir?” asked Turkey, throwing light lantern ruin. “Buried peats,” answered father, laughing. “Come get us out.” Turkey strode heap, turning light said, “I did not know raining peats, sir.” “The peats did not fall quite far snow, Turkey, would made worse job it,” answered father. Meantime Andrew Turkey busy; moments stood upon feet, stiff cold cramped confinement, merry enough heart. “What brought look us?” asked father. “I heard Missy whinnying stable-door,” said Andrew. “When I saw she alone, I knew something happened, waked Turkey. We stopped run manse drop whisky bring us, set once.” “What of the clock now?” asked father. “About one of the clock,” answered Andrew. “One of the clock!” thought I. “What time wait!” “Have long finding us?” “Only hour.” “Then little mare must great trouble getting home. You say her?” “No, sir. She is made her appearance.” “Then do not find her, she dead morning. But shall you, Ranald? Turkey better go home first.” “Please let go too,” I said. “Are able walk?” “Quite--or least I shall be, legs come bit.” Turkey produced bottle milk he brought me, Andrew produced little flask whisky Kirsty sent; father taken little latter, I emptied bottle, set look young Missy. “Where we?” asked father. Turkey told him. “How comes nobody heard shouting, then?” “You know, sir,” answered Turkey, “the old man deaf post, I dare say his people fast asleep.” The snow falling large flakes now, sank air like moultings lovely bird heaven. The moon come again, white world lay around us lovely light. A good deal snow fallen lay peats, could yet trace track two horses. We followed long way little valley dropped side road. We came places one floundering together snow-wreath, length reached spot one parted other. When traced one tracks road, concluded Missy’s, returned other. But followed far came upon poor mare lying upon her back deep runnel, snow soft. She put her forefeet she galloped heedlessly along, tumbled right over. The snow yielded enough let banks get hold her, she lay helpless. Turkey Andrew, however, foresight bring spades rope, set work once, father taking turn then, I holding lantern, useless moonlight. It took hour get poor thing her legs again, she up, could hold her. She wild cold, delight feeling her legs her more, she would broken loose again, galloped recklessly ever. They set her back, father one side Turkey other, Andrew her head, I rode home great comfort. It another good hour arrived, right glad see curtains parlour glow great fire Kirsty kept us. She burst crying made appearance. CHAPTER XXXIII A Solitary Chapter During winter I attended evening school assisted master. I confess, however, means much master near Elsie Duff, I thought many times hour. Her sweet face grew dear me. When I pointed error her work, suggested better mode working, would flush like heart white rose, eagerly she would set herself rectification improvement, her whole manner dumb apology could fault eyes her own. It sweetness gained upon me: length her face almost part consciousness. I suppose condition people would call love her; I never thought that; I thought her. Nor I ever dream saying word her subject. I wished nothing was. To think her day, gently never disturbed Euclid Livy; see her night, get near her then, sitting form her I explained something her slate her book; hear her voice, look her tender eyes, I desired. It never occurred things could go so; change must come; life cannot linger bud, compelled sunshine air flower, life would go on, things would change, time blossom something else, love find set out-of-doors midst strange plants new order things. When school over, I walked home her--not alone, Turkey always side. I suspicion Turkey’s admiration Elsie could ever come collision mine. We joined praising her, admiration ever found words Turkey’s, I thought love her greater his. We seldom went her grandmother’s cottage, she make us welcome. After taken her home generally repaired Turkey’s mother, sure kind reception. She patient diligent woman, looked she nearly done life, gather crumbs it. I often wondered since, her deepest thought--whether she content unhappy, whether she lived hope blessedness beyond. It marvellous little happiness people get world. Surely inwardly sustained something even better joy. “Did ever hear mother sing?” asked Turkey, sat together her little fire, one occasions. “No. I like much,” I answered. The room lighted little oil-lamp, flame fire peats dried oak-bark. “She sings queer ballads never heard,” said Turkey. “Give us one, mother; do.” She yielded, and, low chanting voice, sang something like this:-- Up cam’ waves tide wi’ whush, And back gaed pebbles wi’ whurr, Whan king’s ae son cam’ walking i’ hush, To hear sea murmur murr. The half mune risin’ waves abune, An’ glimmer cauld weet licht Cam’ ower water straucht frae mune, Like path across nicht. What is that, an’ that, far oot i’ grey Atwixt mune land? It is bonny sea-maidens play-- Haud awa’, king’s son, frae strand. Ae rock stud wi’ shadow foot: The king’s son stepped behind: The merry sea-maidens cam’ gambolling oot, Combin’ hair i’ wind. O merry laugh felt land Under light cool feet! Each laid her comb yellow sand, And gladsome dance grew fleet. But fairest she laid her comb itsel’ On rock king’s son lay. He stole about, carven she will He hid his bosom away. And he watched dance till clouds gloom, And wind blew angry tune: One one she caught her comb, To sea went dancin’ doon. But fairest, wi’ hair like mune clud, She sought till she last. He creepin’ went watchin’ stud, And he thought hold her fast. She dropped his feet without motion heed; He took her, home he sped.-- All day she lay like withered seaweed, On purple gowden bed. But night whan wind frae watery bars Blew dusky room, She opened her een like twa settin’ stars, And back came her twilight bloom. The king’s son knelt beside her bed: She his ere month passed; And cold sea-maiden he wed Grew tender wife last. And went well till her baby born, And she couldna sleep; She would rise wander till breakin’ morn, Hark-harkin’ sound deep. One night wind wailing about, And sea speckled wi’ foam, From room room she went And she came her carven comb. She twisted her hair eager hands, She put comb glee: She is she is glittering sands, And away moaning sea. One cry came back far away: He woke, alone. Her night robe lay marble grey, And cold sea-maiden gone. Ever aye frae first peep moon, Whan wind blew aff sea, The desert shore still doon Heavy heart paced he. But never came maidens play From merry cold-hearted sea; He heard laughter far away, But heavy heart paced he. I modernized ballad--indeed spoiled altogether, I made version memory it--with only, I fear, touch original expression. “That is comes taking right to,” said Turkey, practical ever upper hand imaginative. As walked home together I resumed subject. “I think you are hard king’s son,” I said. “He could not help falling love mermaid.” “He business steal her comb, run away herself,” said Turkey. “She none worse it,” said I. “Who told that?” he retorted. “I do not think girl herself would said so. It is every girl would care marry king’s son. She might lover her sea. At events prince none better it.” “But song says she made tender wife,” I objected. “She could not help herself. She made best it. I dare say he was not bad sort fellow, he gentleman.” “Turkey!” I exclaimed. “He prince!” “I know that.” “Then he must gentleman.” “I do not know that. I have read good many princes things I ashamed do.” “But you are prince, Turkey,” I returned, low endeavour bolster wrong silly logic. “No. Therefore I rude dishonest, people would say: ‘What could expect ploughboy?’ A prince ought much better bred ploughboy. I would scorn prince did. What is wrong ploughboy cannot right prince, Ranald. Or else right right sometimes; right may wrong wrong may right, much say right wrong; there is right wrong, world’s awful mess, cannot God, God would never made like that.” “Well, Turkey, know best. I cannot help thinking prince much blame, though.” “You see came it--misery.” “Perhaps he would rather misery together none it.” “That is settle. But he must seen he wrong, he done wandering sea like that.” “Well now, Turkey, would done yourself, suppose beautifulest laid her comb within inch standing--and never saw you, know?” Turkey thought moment answering. “I am supposing fell love her first sight, know,” I added. “Well, I am sure I kept comb, even I taken get chance speaking her. And I cannot help fancying he behaved like gentleman, let her go without touching her first time, she might come again; he married her last her free will, she would run away him, let sea kept calling her ever much.” The next evening, I looked Elsie usual, see her. How blank dull schoolroom seemed! Still she might arrive moment. But she come. I went duties wearily, hoping ever hour release. I could see well enough Turkey anxious too. The moment school over, hurried away, almost without word, cottage. There found her weeping. Her grandmother died suddenly. She clung Turkey, seemed almost forget presence. But I thought nothing that. Had case mine, I clung Turkey faith his help superior wisdom. There two three old women place. Turkey went spoke them, took Elsie home his mother. Jamie asleep, would wake him. How arranged, I forget, Elsie Jamie lived rest winter Turkey’s mother. The cottage let, cow taken home father. Before summer Jamie got place shop village, Elsie went back her mother. CHAPTER XXXIV An Evening Visit I saw much less Elsie; I went Turkey, often I could, visit her her father’s cottage. The evenings spent amongst happiest hours memory. One evening particular appears stand type whole. I remember every point visit. I think must almost last. We set sun going evening end April, nightly frosts yet vanished. The hail dancing us started; sun disappearing bank tawny orange cloud; night would cold dark stormy; cared nothing that: conflict elements always added pleasure undertaking then. It midst another shower hail, driven blasts keen wind, arrived little cottage. It built Duff receive his bride, although since enlarged, still little house. It foundation stone, walls turf. He lined boards, however, made warmer comfortable labourers’ dwellings. When entered, glowing fire peat hearth, pot supper hung it. Mrs. Duff spinning, Elsie, light little oil lamp suspended wall, teaching her youngest brother read. Whatever she did, she always seemed eyes better anyone else; see her lamp, one arm round little fellow stood leaning her, hand pointed knitting-needle letters spelling-book lay her knee, see lovely picture. The mother rise her spinning, spoke kindly welcome, Elsie got up, without approaching us, saying word two, set chairs us fire, took little fellow away put bed. “It is cold night,” said Mrs. Duff. “The wind seems blow I sit wheel. I wish husband would come home.” “He will suppering his horses,” said Turkey. “I will run across give hand, that will bring sooner.” “Thank you, Turkey,” said Mrs. Duff he vanished. “He is fine lad,” she remarked, much phrase father used speaking him. “There is nobody like Turkey,” I said. “Indeed, I think you are right there, Ranald. A better-behaved lad does not step. He will something distinguish day. I should not wonder he went college, wagged his head pulpit yet.” The idea Turkey wagging his head pulpit made laugh. “Wait till see,” resumed Mrs. Duff, somewhat offended reception her prophecy. “Folk hear yet.” “I did not mean he could not minister, Mrs. Duff. But I do not think he take that.” Here Elsie came back, lifting lid pot, examined state contents. I got hold her hand, first time she withdrew it. I feel hurt, she gently. Then she began set white deal table middle floor, time she put plates spoons upon it, water pot boiling, she began make porridge, she judged first-rate--in mind, equal Kirsty. By time ready, her father Turkey came in. James Duff said grace, sat supper. The wind blowing hard outside, every hail came deafening rattles little windows, and, descending wide chimney, danced floor hearth; thought long, stormy way us home interfered enjoyment hour. After supper, enlivened simple chat crops doings farm, James turned me, said: “Have not got song ballad give us, Ranald? I know you are always getting hold things.” I expected this; for, every time I went, I tried something repeat them. As I could sing, nearest way I might contribute evening’s entertainment. Elsie fond ballads, I could hardly please her better bringing new one me. But default that, old one story would welcomed. My reader must remember books part country, therefore mode literature precious. The schoolmaster chief source I derived provision sort. On present occasion, I prepared ballad his. I remember every word now, give readers, reminding easy skip it, care kind thing. “Bonny lassie, rosy lassie, Ken ye care? Had ye ever thought, lassie, Made yer hertie sair?” Johnnie said it, Johnnie luikin’ Into Jeannie’s face; Seekin’ garden hedge For open place. “Na,” said Jeannie, saftly smilin’, “Nought care ken I; For say carlin’ Is better passit by.” “Licht hert ye are, Jeannie, As foot ban’! Lang sic answer To ony spierin’ man.” “I ken ye wad hae, sir, Though yer words few; Ye wad hae aye careless, Till I care you.” “Dinna mock me, Jeannie, lassie, Wi’ yer lauchin’ ee; For ye hae nae notion What gaes me.” “No I hae notion OF what is yonder cairn; I am sae pryin’, Johnnie, It is none concern.” “Well, there is ae thing, Jeannie, Ye canna help, doo-- Ye canna help carin’ Wi’ a’ hert you.” Johnnie turned left her, Listed war; In year cam’ limpin’ Hame wi’ mony scar. Wha sittin’ Wan worn wi’ care? Could his Jeannie Aged alter’d sair? Her goon black, her eelids Reid wi’ sorrow’s dew: Could she twalmonth Be wife widow too? Jeannie’s hert gaed wallop, Ken ‘t whan he spak’: “I thocht ye deid, Johnnie: Is’t yersel’ come back?” “O Jeannie, ye, tell me, Wife widow baith? To see ye lost I am, I wad verra laith,” “I canna widow That wife never nane; But gin ye hae me, Noo I ane.” His crutch he flang frae him, Forgetful war’s harms; But couldna stan’ withoot it, And fell Jeannie’s arms. “That is bad ballad,” said James Duff. “Have tune would go to, Elsie?” Elsie thought little, asked repeat first verse. Then she sung clear fair tune I never heard before. “That splendidly, Elsie,” I said. “I write you, able sing next time I come.” She made answer. She Turkey looking other, hear me. James Duff began talk me. Elsie putting away supper-things. In minutes I missed her Turkey, absent time. They return together, first Turkey, Elsie minutes after. As night getting quite stormy, James Duff counselled return, obeyed. But little either Turkey I cared wind hail. I saw Elsie church Sundays; she far attentive modest ever give even look. Sometimes I word her came out, father expected us walk home him; I generally saw Turkey walk away her. CHAPTER XXXV A Break Story I rapidly approaching moment I said I bring history end--the moment, namely, I became aware boyhood behind me. I left home summer first time, followed brother Tom grammar school county-town, order afterwards follow University. There much novelty expectation change, I feel separation father rest family much first. That came afterwards. For time, pleasure long ride top mail-coach, bright sun pleasant breeze, various incidents connected changing horses starting afresh, outlook first peep sea, occupied attention thoroughly. I care dwell experience grammar school. I worked fairly, got on; whether I gain scholarship remained doubtful enough. Before time examination arrived, I went spend week home. It great disappointment I return without seeing Elsie. But could helped. The Sunday I stormy day, late October, Elsie bad cold, Turkey informed me, could out; father made many engagements me, that, one thing another, I able go see her. Turkey man’s work farm, stood high ever estimation father everyone knew him. He great favourite Allister Davie myself, took much place former he taken me. I lost nothing regard him, he talked familiarity before, urging diligence thoroughness studies, pressing upon one ever done lasting work, “that is,” Turkey would say--“work goes making world,” without earnest _what_ conscientious _how_. “I do not want try great man,” he said once. “You might succeed, find failed altogether.” “How could be, Turkey?” I objected. “A body cannot succeed fail once.” “A body might succeed,” he replied, “in he wanted do, find least he thought it.” “What rule follow, then, Turkey?” I asked. “Just rule duty,” he replied. “What ought do, must do. Then choice comes, involving duty, know, choose like best.” This substance he said. If anyone thinks pedantic, I say, he would thought he heard uttered--in homely forms sounds Scottish tongue. “Are not fit something better farm-work yourself, Turkey?” I ventured suggest, foolishly impelled, I suppose, try whether I could give advice too. “It is _my_ work,” said Turkey, decisive tone, left room rejoinder. This conversation took place barn, Turkey happened thrashing alone morning. In turning sheaf, laying fresh one, always moment’s pause din, talked, conversation good deal broken. I buried straw, days old, keep warm, I lay looked Turkey he thrashed, thought his face grown much solemn used be. But he smiled, seldom, old merry sweetness dawned again. This last long talk I ever him. The next day I returned examination, happy enough gain small scholarship, entered first winter college. My father wrote week so, occasionally I letter ink matter one younger brothers. Tom Edinburgh, lawyer’s office. I correspondence Turkey. Mr. Wilson wrote sometimes, along good advice would occasionally send verses, he told little nothing going on. CHAPTER XXXVI I Learn I Man It Saturday morning, early April, I climbed mail-coach return home summer; university year divided Scotland. The sky bright, great fleecy clouds sailing it, fell shower large drops. The wind keen, I wrap well cloak. But heart light, full pleasure ended successful labour, home-going, signs sun sky gave summer hand. Five months gone since I last left home, seemed age Davie, he burst crying he saw me. My father received certain still tenderness, seemed grow upon him. Kirsty followed Davie’s example, Allister, without saying much, haunted like shadow. I saw nothing Turkey evening. In morning went church, course, I sat beside reclining stone warrior, whose face age nearly worn features away. I gazed time singing first psalm, grew upon strange solemnity, sense passing away earthly things, stronger conviction I ever need something could pass. This feeling lasted time service, increased I lingered church almost alone father come vestry. I stood passage, leaning tomb. A cloud came sun, whole church grew dark December day--gloomy cheerless. I heard time, almost without hearing them, two old women talking together close me. The pulpit me, I became thoroughly aware presence, I peeped round saw them. “And happen, said you?” asked one them, whose head moved incessant capricious motion palsy. “About two of the clock morning,” answered other, leaned stick, almost bent double rheumatism. “I saw next-door neighbour morning, he seen Jamie, goes home Saturday night, know; William Seceder, nobody’s tell minister, I am waiting let know; she great favourite his, he is see her often. They are much pitied--poor people! Nobody thought would come sudden like. When I saw her mother last, notion her head.” Before I could ask talking, father came aisle vestry, stopped speak old women. “Elsie Duff’s gone, poor thing!” said rheumatic one. I grew stupid. What followed I forgotten. A sound ears, body seemed believe it, though soul could comprehend it. When I came I alone church. They gone away without seeing me. I standing beside monument, leaning carved Crusader. The sun shining, old church full light. But sunshine changed me, I felt mournful. I see sweet face, hear lovely voice, world. I endeavoured realize thought, could not, I left church hardly conscious anything dull sense loss. I found father grave. He spoke tenderly Elsie; he know I loved her, I could make much response. I think, too, he said less he otherwise would, fear calling back mind vivid memory ill I behaved her. It was, indeed, first thought moment he uttered her name, soon passed, much come between. In evening I went farm look Turkey, church morning afternoon. He one I could talk Elsie. I found one cow-houses, bedding cows. His back towards I entered. “Turkey,” I said. He looked round slow mechanical motion, conscious effort will. His face white, wore look loss, almost terrified like presence something awful. I stood speechless. He looked moment, came slowly me, laid his hand shoulder. “Ranald,” he said, “we married next year.” Before grief man, mighty silence, whole humbled. I knew love great his. It grew eyes pale feeble thing; I felt worthless presence her dead, alive I loved peaceful gladness. Elsie belonged Turkey, he lost her, his heart breaking. I threw arms round him, wept him, myself. It thus I ceased boy. Here, therefore, story ends. Before I returned university, Turkey enlisted left place. My father’s half-prophecy concerning fulfilled. He general. I tell his name. For reason he taken his mother’s, he well known. I never seen him, heard him, since he left father’s service; I confident ever meet, old true friends.
