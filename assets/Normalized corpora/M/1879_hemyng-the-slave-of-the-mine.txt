Slowly solemnly dealer took cards box, equal solemnity players moved checks fancy dictated. The first speaker man decided English cast countenance, profusion side whiskers he wore strengthened his Britannic look. He well dressed, handsome, though somewhat haggard, he suffered want sleep, cankering care gnawing his heart. A gold ring, set turquoise diamonds, sparkled his finger, his watch chain heavy massive. The gambler probably forty years age, ten twelve his companion, his face bore traces drink dissipation; shrewd, good-natured twinkle his eye showed he bad-natured man main. In reality, Dan Markham known Pacific Slope good fellow. Retiring lower end room, first speaker accepted glass wine handed negro waiter attended supper-table. "You saying, Mr.--er--Mr.----" he began. "Markham," replied individual. "Ah, yes! Thank you! Well, observing----" "Just this: I know man plays, even though he is well fixed got heaps shug." "Do you?" "Yes, Mr.--er--Mr." continued Markham, imitating his companion's tone rather mocking manner. "Smith. Call Smith." "All right, Smith; play want excitement. That is secret it. You have got home." "That is true." "No wife?" "No." "Exactly. If man's got home, comforts, young ones, fact word implies, he do not want go gambling-saloon. No, sir. It is fellows like buck tiger."

"Then I say mighty unpleasant way, I do not like cent." "Is so?" "Yes." "Then lump it," replied Dan Markham, lighting cigar staring face. Mr. Smith evidently want quarrel, he walked away strolled rooms, four. These rooms elegantly furnished, provided sofas easy-chairs. On tables best periodicals magazines, frequenters gambling-house could away time without actually playing. But tables possessed fascination Smith, he called himself, could resist. He strolled back faro game watched play, kept incessantly. When one player fell out, another took his place, went on, night long, till garish streaks gray dawn stole shades windows, men turned night day thought prudent go home. A young handsome man attracted Mr. Smith's attention. He well dressed, air refinement him. His eyes bloodshot his face haggard. His hands clutched chips nervously, he restless, feverish excited. He pushed clustering chestnut locks his fair brow, watched cards came eagerness showed he took ordinary interest game. His luck villainous. He lost almost every time, he tried make "pot" recoup himself, same--the wrong card came out. At length he put his hand his pocket found money there. With sigh he rose table, bowed head bent back, his eyes lowered his face wearing expression embodiment despair, he walked away. Mr. Smith followed him. This type character situation he evidently liked study. "Ruined! Ruined!" he muttered. At juncture he encountered Dan Markham, paying his respects boned turkey, making respectable supper. The professional gambler always eat drink, fluctuations game little effect his appetite. "Hello! Baby," he exclaimed; "you to-night?" "As see," replied young man, whose feminine cast countenance justified epithet "Baby" gambler bestowed upon him. "I thought I told keep here." "I know it." "Then did not follow orders?" "Because I could not. It I took first downward step, to-night I taken last." The gambler regarded curiously. "Clarence Holt," he said, "have drinking?" "Not drop; time I did. My lips parched dry. I fire, brain body. Is foretaste hereafter store me?" "Weak-minded fool!" cried Dan. "Yes, I weak-minded trust you. I fool listen rose-colored stories fortunes made faro-bank." "Come, come! kicking." During conversation Mr. Smith leaning wall, half concealed shadow, smoking cigar, he ostensibly engaged jotting memoranda pencil scrap paper, yet word lost upon him. "You bully much please, Dan Markham!" exclaimed Clarence Holt. "But I warn I getting tired it." "Tired, eh?" "Yes, sir; limit human endurance." "Is there? Since find out?" sneered Dan. "To-night. I lost whole month's salary." "What that? I will lend money." "Yes, terms before," replied Clarence Holt, bitterly. "You made forge name manager bank I employed extent three thousand dollars."

Are already forger? I hold three notes Mr. Simpson, manager Bank California, he never signed, though him; notes presented payment go right State Prison Stockton quicker railroading."

Clarence Holt clerk Bank California, forged name Mr. Simpson, manager, extent three thousand dollars, Markham holding forged notes. That evening Clarence risked his whole mouth's salary faro, lost. Hence his despair agitation fully accounted for. "What want me?" asked Clarence. "My money." "What take notes?" "Double face-value, I will hand anybody." Mr. Smith stepped forward bowed politely. "Pardon me," said he. "Did I understand say anxious sell notes?" "Oh! it is you, Mr. Smith," replied Markham. "If you have got six thousand dollars throw away security worth three, deal. I want go Sacramento to-morrow, I will sell out." "I overheard entire conversation," said Mr. Smith, "and I sincerely commiserate young man, fallen hands sharper!" "Throwing bricks, eh?" "Never mind, friend. Hand notes I give money." Markham produced wallet filled papers bills, among he searched he found documents he want. "Here are," he exclaimed. "I would like find fool like every day week." "Would you?" "If I did, I would die rich." Laughing heartily his joke, Markham handed notes received six thousand dollars exchange. "Thank you," he added, extending his hand Clarence Holt, he said: "Good-by. Take advice. It is straight. Never bet card again." Nodding carelessly Mr. Smith, he knocked ash his cigar left room. When he gone, Clarence Holt grasped Mr. Smith's hand. "How I thank you?" he exclaimed. "My dear fellow," replied Mr. Smith, "you nothing thank for." "Nothing!" "No, indeed." "But saved me," said Clarence. "You whole-souled, generous-hearted man. Give forged notes, I may tear up, begin again, and, leading new life, bless ever." A cynical smile curled lip Mr. Smith. "Not fast, young friend," he said. "What mean?" "Simply I friend, I done anything particularly generous nature." "How?" Clarence Holt's countenance fell he ejaculated monosyllable. "You exchanged one master another," replied Mr. Smith. "Really, sir," said Clarence, "I loss understand you. I took gentleman who, accident overheard conversation intended his ears, endeavored atone his conduct lay his power help----" "Do not catechise me, please," interrupted Mr. Smith. "I wish offensive." "If I would allow gratify inclination. Mr. Markham handed me, I bought you." "Bought me?" "Why, certainly." "May I ask reason acting eccentric manner?" "Yes; I like buy men. It fancy mine. I find useful occasionally." Clarence Holt bit his lip. "Where live?" A card containing address Mission Street handed him, and, glancing carelessly it, he put his pocket. "When I want you," he said, "I shall know find you." A rebellious fire burnt Clarence's eye. "Suppose I refuse bidding?" he asked. "Oh! well, case I go bank show authorities notes I bought. I presume would see punished, taken care year two." Clarence pressed his hands together violently. "Oh! I come this?" he cried. "Would God I taken dear wife's advice never gambled!" Mr. Smith looked him. "Married, eh?" he remarked. "Yes, sir." "Pretty wife?" "The divine creature ever saw. I suppose I partial judge, opinion relied on; I assure you, sir, artist poet ever conceived lovely specimen womanhood darling Elise." "Humph! How long married?" "Three years." "And love still?" "Yes, indeed; ever." "Odd way showing love, coming gambling-house. Any children?" "One little girl. But allow explain. I came month's salary try make money enough pay Markham, ruin. Now I dollar go home with, live I know." Mr. Smith took dozen twenty-dollar gold pieces his purse. "Take these," he said. "You lend me?" cried Clarence, delightedly. "I give you. What use lending money pauper? I give I would give alms beggar." "Your words bitter," said young man, he shivered visibly. "There necessity silver-tongued you," reply. "Go home wife. I call see soon." Mr. Smith threw chair, appeared take notice Clarence, he seated manner permitted good view gambling-table. At first Clarence Holt hurried toward door, full virtuous resolution return home. Then he paused, turned toward lunch table, he ate little salad drank wine. The gold pieces burning hole his pocket. They amply sufficient live upon month; he could double them! Surely his bad luck could stick evening. He would try again. "What time it?"--he looked clock--"only eleven!" Elise, his little wife, got baby sleep time probably reading, eagerly expecting his return home. Another hour make great difference. He goes table buys checks, he begins speculate. Mr. Smith laughs air Mephisto, says himself: "I knew it. Score one knowledge character. He weak man easily led. So much better me." Presently lady, thickly vailed, entered saloon looked timidly around her. Evidently she searching one. Seldom, indeed, lady seen saloon, custom fair sex gamble America, whatever may Europe. The negro charge lunch-table advanced toward her. "What want heah, madam?" he asked. "I looking gentleman," she replied, nervous tone. "Plenty ob gen'elmen come go night.

I heard husband's voice, I see him." She pushed past negro, would fain stopped her he able so, her movements quick intercept her. "This becoming decidedly interesting," observed Mr. Smith; "Elise come Clarence. By Jove!" he added, she raised her vail, "she justifies his description her. A prettier creature I never saw!" The luck changed, Clarence fortunate enough win largely, pile gold his side fully testified. The young wife tapped shoulder. "Clarence," she whispered. "You here?" he cried, flush annoyance crossed his face. "Oh, yes; forgive me. Come home, not?" "How dare follow here?" "I lonely. I found note Markham appointing meeting here, I knew salary you. We food house, and----" "Confound you!" he interrupted, almost fiercely. "Do want every man know private affairs?" "What men you, Clarence?" "Go home. I come I ready. You distract me.

He handed driver two dollars, Elise taken her apartments luxurious style entirely new her. Mr. Smith returned gambling-saloon, much impressed modesty beauty Elise. "Decidedly, she good Clarence," he muttered. Once gilded saloon vice he looked vain Clarence among players. "Where young man winning?" he asked dealer. "He dropped out," answer. "A loser?" "Yes. He staked his pile one card, somehow did not come he expected." "Fool!" remarked Mr. Smith. He walked suite handsomely-furnished rooms see Clarence was, he could left place, he would met stairs. In inner apartment he saw sight startled, though surprise him. Mr. Smith man world, difficult surprise, part his education temperament exhibit emotion anything. Kneeling large mirror, his face pale haggard beyond expression, Clarence Holt. In his right hand he held pistol, his left photograph Elise, he kissing passionately. It sad picture, showed desperate straits drink gambling reduce votaries. * * * * * Suddenly he dropped picture placed muzzle pistol his temple. "God forgive me," he prayed, "and help widow orphan. Elise, darling, life, all, farewell." Mr. Smith rushed forward knocked his arm, critical moment young man's career weapon went without injuring him, ball lodged ceiling. It narrow escape.

"No, Elise child," reply. "Give her. A fellow like deserves nothing good thrashing." "That is I say," answered Clarence, old, despairing look coming again. "Let die." Mr. Smith looked disgusted. "If do not leave whining," he exclaimed, "I shall strongly tempted kick you!" Clarence move; he picked his hat left pistol fallen. "Be man," continued Mr. Smith. "Do not afraid world world will not hurt you." Humiliated, his head whirl, Clarence quitted room, Mr. Smith re-entered gambling-saloon, noisy party miners who, come town plenty money, could resist fascinations faro. All Mr. Smith confronted man, exclaimed: "So met sooner I expected!" "Harkaway," repeated person called Smith. "At service, lord," reply. Jack met Lord Maltravers.

"You shall escape way," he said. "Hold there," cried volunteer. "Oh, I am afraid you," cried Jack. "I am Nappa Bill," said man, "and I cannot make squeal, I want go home." "Listen me," said Harkaway.

Seeing would useless attempt arrest his lordship turn affairs taken, Jack relinquished his idea. "Gentlemen, I leave amuse yourselves," exclaimed Maltravers. Jack furiously indignant, burned rage he saw his enemy make door. "Stop!" he cried. "To oblige you? Oh, dear, no. I rather think not. I shall glad meet Foster's Cliff House to-morrow two, promise come unattended." "I there." "On terms?" "Yes." "Very well; discuss situation; present, enough say good-night." Always polished villain, Maltravers bowed took his departure. Jack baffled, sit consider he do, Nappa Bill made furious lunge knife. Seeing movement, he stepped one side escaped killed almost miracle. Being armed, he drew pistol. "Keep off," he said, "or I will shoot." "That is good enough. I like see man heeled. I will pleasure cutting now," answered Nappa Bill. "What want fight for?" "Was not I paid it? Why, look here, I would scorn take man's money nothing it." "Come on, then. The sooner thing settled better." Nappa Bill want asked twice; he accepted invitation threw upon Jack, received slight flesh-wound his shoulder. Drawing quickly back, he fired snap-shot ruffian, time take aim. The bullet struck Nappa Bill middle wrist, fearful oath he allowed his knife drop floor. "Curse you!" he cried.

Jack put his pistol back his pocket, careless laugh quitted room. There several men standing his way, quickly made space him. Nappa Bill attempt injure further. He contented using strong adjectives, would look well print. Harkaway first move game. CHAPTER III. MALTRAVERS'S PLOT. Early following day Maltravers presented Clarence Holt's lodgings, Mission Street. He found husband wife breakfast. They rose welcomed him, though apparent fear warmth reception. "Go breakfast," he said; "do not mind me." "Thank you, I through," replied Clarence, lost appetite sight man held his power; "it time I started bank." "You need trouble business to-day." "How?" "I want little work me." Elise looked reproachfully her husband. "If neglect duties lose situation!" she exclaimed. "I find another happen," said his lordship. "Can I talk alone, Holt?" "Certainly, sir." He handed paper his wife, added: "Go, dear, room, amuse news I liberty." Elise, ill grace, quitted room, wondering secret business two men transact. With quick instinct woman, always less disciple Lavater, judge male character, she took dislike Maltravers she fair opportunity studying his face. Not he homely. Far it. He sort man fascinate woman, lurking devil his features betrayed slumbering fire wickedness within. Her husband Mr. Smith closeted together hour, latter left. "You fully understand?" said his lordship, parting. "Perfectly." "I leave Calistoga afternoon, depend upon you." "I best, sir," replied Clarence, respectfully. Closing door, he sank chair wiped beads perspiration his forehead. "He man," he muttered; "he fiend." Elise entered room. "What say?" she asked. "Nothing," replied Clarence, evasively. "I go out. This evening I shall take theatre." "Indeed!" Her eyes sparkled pleasure, often her husband late invited her out. In happier days habit going together, Clarence left her alone her baby. He kissed her old-time tenderness, act brought tears her eyes. "Oh, would always like this," she said, "I begin feel happy again." "The time come, darling," he answered. "God grant it. You changed lately, Clarry. I thought terrible secret mind." "Oh, no." "But tell me, not, influence man you?" "What man?" "Mr. Smith, he you. What talking about, he kept away work?" "Little women ask questions," he replied. With deep-drawn sigh, Elise turned away hide her tears, flowed afresh, Clarence Holt went out. She felt awful secret he kept concealed her. The brief happiness she experienced short-lived, heavy sensation oppressed her heart clung round more. Clarence sent note bank, excusing his absence plea sickness, going livery stable, hired wagon pair horses, he drove Golden Gate Park Captain Foster's Cliff House. On his way he looked frequently photograph Maltravers given him, underneath written name "Jack Harkaway." When he reached Cliff House he put his horse she would entered bar-room. Jack already there, smoking cigar window, looking seals rocks sea. "Mr. Harkaway, I believe," said Clarence. "That name, sir," replied Jack. "What business me?" "I commissioned give letter." Jack took proffered epistle his hand, tearing open envelope, read contents, follows: "I find impossible meet to-day, appointed, I making preparations leave San Francisco once, I like see evening California Theatre. I Box B. I formally give claims certain lady's hand, let alone I molest more. "M." "Thank you," said Jack. "What answer shall I take back?" asked Clarence Holt. "Say I theatre." He tore note fragments, bow Clarence left him. Presently he joined tall, stout, florid-looking man, well dressed, apparently well-to-do, said: "Fine day." "Is it?" replied Jack, abstractedly. "I said fine day, sir." "Well, it?" asked Jack. "You are Britisher, are not you?" "I am." "Guessed so. Been long?" "Really, I do not see length residence country possibly interest you," said Jack. "Do not see it, hey?' "No, I do not, more, I habit talking strangers." "Got get cured that. However, want introduction, I will give you. Here is card." Jack glanced it, read name "Captain Blower." Out politeness he exchanged cards him. "Mr. Harkaway, I am glad know you," said captain. "I am Forty-niner, bet I am solid." "Indeed?" remarked Jack, smile. "Yes, sir. I real estate, I am interested mine. How like climate?" "Pretty good morning, rather cold dusty afternoon." "What think seals?" These two first questions San Franciscans always ask strangers. "Oh, seals did not strike anything wonderful," replied Jack. "Are not, eh?" "They seem quiet, inoffensive-looking creatures lie rocks basking sun." "I will bet would not care swim bring one back," exclaimed Captain Blower. "Oh! That would easy enough." "I will bet you." "My dear Sir, I do not want make show myself, I would moment." "I will bet you," said Captain Blower, third time. Harkaway grew irritated his persistence. "What bet?" he asked. "Five hundred dollars." "I do not like take money." "There came from. You dursn't it." "Put up," said Jack, promptly. The captain walked military-looking gentleman, producing roll bills, counted five hundred dollars. "Foster!" he exclaimed proprietor Cliff House, "you know me?" "Well, I hope so," reply. "I have bet gentleman, Mr. Harkaway, five hundred he cannot swim rocks bring back seal, I want hold stakes." "I will it. But gentleman know it is breeding-season, seals dangerous time year?" Harkaway approached handed his money. "That does not matter!" he exclaimed. "I am willing accept bet. All I want bathing-suit sharp knife. That is fair, I hope." "Certainly," said Mr. Foster. "I do not object," replied Captain Blower. "You see big fellow half way biggest rock?" continued Jack, pointing sea. "Yes; one call General Butler." "All right, I will undertake bring back, although I might win bet carrying one small seals." Foster admired his courage, doubted his ability carry his determination. He took Jack bedroom, he donned bathing-suit given carving-knife, formidable weapon house. Thus provided he walked seaside himself, Foster Captain Blower, armed opera-glasses, sat chairs piazza watched his progress. Jack excellent swimmer, plunging sea, swam rapidly toward seal-rocks. He carried knife his teeth. The seals, could numbered hundreds, crept sea lying various places rocks, apparently asleep. Some must awake, however, every loud bark heard. What Captain Foster said seals dangerous perfectly true. They bearing young, perfectly ready repel invasion territory. This Jack know. No one ever interfered them, penal offense shoot them, one shows city. What would San Francisco without seals? A pleasant swim ten fifteen minutes' duration brought largest three rocks. The seals began bark, dived water. To climb difficult, seaweed wet slippery, ebb tide. One seal attempted bite him, dexterous thrust his knife gave sea-lion his death-blow. With praiseworthy perseverance Jack got big seal disporting rays sun. The animal showed gleaming tusks snapped Jack's leg, missing half inch. Jack stooped tried stab huge beast, his foot slipped, he rolled he fell loud splash sea. The seal also lost balance, came toppling top him. Fortunately, Jack retained his hold knife. When he rose surface, he found confronted dozen angry seals, time lively fight ensued. The sea stained blood, Jack received bites, less severe, serious enough disable him. At length, dexterous thrust, he killed huge seal he first singled his prey. It keeled over, grasping one fins, he dragged laboriously shore, swimming one hand. "By thunder!" said Captain Blower, "I reckoned critters would chawed up." "It is his good luck not," replied Mr. Foster, lowering his opera-glass. Clarence Holt one spectators singular scene. "You five hundred dollars out," he remarked. "Oh, I do not care that. A friend mine, Mr. Smith, gave speculate with," replied Captain Blower, smiling significantly. Clarence much surprised declaration. "Are acquainted Mr. Smith?" he asked. "Yes. Anything funny that? It is uncommon name, it?" "Oh, no, I happen employed gentleman, all," answered Clarence; "and I say is, Smith's agents numerous, I should not like Jack Harkaway." "Why, no," said Captain Blower. "It would tickle death hold insurance his life." Clarence, this, drove off, ever impressed power resources his employer. In time Jack appeared his captive, Mr. Foster said he would stuffed commemoration event. Jack took bath, plastered his bites, feel worse his exploit. Captain Blower paid money hurried away, he work attend to. Jack ridden over, calling his horse, mounted rode toward Golden Gate Park. Soon afterward buggy came behind quick pace. In Captain Blower, gave utterance whoop would done credit Piute Indian war-path. This cry startled Jack's horse, started top speed. Jack endeavored rein in, bridle broke, he utterly powerless control guide maddened animal. Some one evidently tampered rein, half cutting two. The gate park drawing near, Jack became nervous, he got thrown hard road he would killed. Fortunately, horse swerved dashed across sand-hills left, plowing his knees, greatly diminishing his speed. At length his rider saw chance throwing soft place, so. The horse came stop little on. Jack walked examined bridle, which, he suspected, cut. "Lord Maltravers's agents again. I cannot trust man," he muttered. "It best arrested to-night, theatre. I see I keep faith him." Mending rein he walked horse home, hotel found his two old friends, Mr. Mole Harvey, he left New York, arrived. The professor walked stick, yet little lame. Harvey bearer long letter many kind messages Lena Vanhoosen. It great pleasure Jack see his friends, he related happened since his arrival San Francisco. "By means arrest Maltravers theatre to-night," said Harvey, "and put stop his intrigues, all." "I will," replied Jack. "Suppose I come end first act bring police officer me?" "That do," answered Jack. Mr. Mole gone outside corridor, Jack Harvey heard great uproar. They rushed out, found professor attacking man his crutch. "Hold on, sir!" cried Jack. "What about?" Mr. Mole stopped beating man, instantly ran away. "I cannot stand it, Jack," said Mr. Mole. "I am old man nerves weak." "What occurred ruffle feathers?" "I half day San Francisco, man I chastising asked me, twentieth time, I liked climate I thought seals." "Ha, ha!" laughed Jack. "It may funny, limit human endurance," replied professor, shaking his head, dismally. "Oh! it is nothing get used it," Jack said. Mr. Mole retired his room, evidently laboring impression he badly used, Harkaway went Harvey promenade Montgomery Street. CHAPTER IV. THE BOX AT THE CALIFORNIA THEATRE. It quite gala night theatre, every seat taken. The prima donna English Opera Company delighting town took benefit. Soon curtain rose Harkaway, evening dress, sought seclusion Box B, he shown usher.

"Then I powerless help you," said Elise, sigh. "My dear young lady," exclaimed Jack, "I know I living midst danger, said much I strongest wish hear more." "Every moment precious." "Why waste time, then? You seem take interest me." "I do, indeed. Oh! shall I do?" cried Elise. They still standing back box, one could see them, crash music prevented voices heard. "Speak!

I heard husband talking stranger. My husband clerk bank; he committed forgeries enable gamble. These forgeries held Mr. Smith, alias Lord Maltravers, enemy." "Ha!" ejaculated Harkaway. "You expected meet Lord Maltravers evening," pursued Elise. "Candidly, right." "He gone Geysers make terms Vasquez, bandit, kidnap you." "And then?" "You shipped Rio de Janeiro, remainder days work slave diamond mines Brazil." "But done, dear girl?" asked Jack, smiling. "I know not; plans made up. It horrible." "Is all?" "No. You love Miss Lena Vanhoosen, New York?" "I do." "Well, husband come presently." "In here?" "Yes, box, accuse flirting me. He raise disturbance. You arrested. The case papers to-morrow, Miss Vanhoosen told unfaithful vows." Jack whistled. Though Elise spoke quickly, her story disconnected parts, was, nevertheless, intelligible enough. His enemy actively work. "I thank you, much," said he. "I thousand times obliged you. Good-night." "Good-night. It safe stay here." "No, indeed." "You reveal I told you?" pleaded Elise. "Not worlds." "They would kill knew." Jack went door box depart, he saw Elise's handkerchief lying floor. Always gallant, quite ladies' man, he stooped picked up. "Your handkerchief, I think," he said; "allow return it." "Thank you!" replied Elise. He give her, door box opened Clarence Holt entered. The latter pretended profoundly astonished. "Elise!" he exclaimed, "who man?" The poor girl, terribly frightened, sank seat. "Answer me!" continued Clarence, "I insist upon it, right." Jack stepped him. "You need continue farce, sir!" he said, "for know perfectly well name Harkaway, met Cliff House morning." "I deny it. I never saw life, I want good enough explain I find alone private box wife?" "I shall give explanation." "But I one," blustered Clarence. "Ask Lord Maltravers," said Jack. Clarence stepped back shot. "Subterfuges avail you, sir," he replied. "This wife's handkerchief hold hand. You villain trickster!" "No man shall call that," cried Jack. He raised his fist knocked Clarence down, precisely pliant tool Lord Maltravers wanted. Elise shrieked. The attention whole house quickly transferred occupants Box B. "Help! help!" shouted Clarence. Two policemen stationed outside entered seized Jack. At time newspaper reporter, also told hand, made his appearance. "Arrest man!" said Clarence. "I charge assaulting me, I tried protect honor." "I protest," exclaimed Jack. The policeman, already heavily bribed, dragged away station-house. "What about?" asked reporter. "I tell presently," replied Clarence. To add confusion, Elise fainted. CHAPTER V. VASQUEZ, THE BANDIT. Harkaway merely taken station-house kept half hour. This indignity he subjected to. After he discharged, one came make complaint him. All Lord Maltravers wanted scene theatre, scandal could made pretty story newspapers. Harkaway's escapade, would called, could sent Miss Vanhoosen, her mind poisoned reading Jack caught box theatre another man's wife. This part his deep-laid plot. Jack returned Palace Hotel, Mr. Mole Harvey awaiting him. They could help laughing heard Maltravers succeeded tricking him, all. "Never mind; harm done," said professor. "You write Miss Vanhoosen, word go anything he say." "It is not he say," exclaimed Jack; "it is papers print." "Hang papers!" growled Harvey. "Of course," continued Jack, "Maltravers send papers Lena, know women think anything print." "It is dirty, mean trick Maltravers," said Harvey. "So is; he carries rest his programme, girl box described it, sends friend Jack Brazils?" "I look well galley slave," remarked Jack, laughing. "It laughing matter," continued Mr. Mole. "We will not leave him," said Harvey. "He shall not go alone." This settled, retired rest. The morning papers fully realized Jack's expectations, contained full sensational accounts disturbance California Theatre. Names freely given, affair aroused liveliest interest. In vain Jack wrote letters explanatory occurrence. The papers would insert them, lie went forth uncontradicted, Maltravers triumphant. While Jack chewing cud bitter reflection, he received letter bearing Calistoga postmark. It signed "Anonymous," stated following: "If Mr. Harkaway wishes meet Lord Maltravers, he find Geysers, Northern California. Go Fossville Calistoga find fresh instructions awaiting you, Four-in-Hand Foss." "Look this," said Jack, handing letter Harvey. Dick read replied: "Queer! Who deuce Four-in-Hand Foss?" "I will find out, I will start Calistoga to-day." Mr. Mole entered juncture. "And go Calistoga for?" he asked. Jack read letter. "It is trap, dear friend," replied professor. "Trap trap, I am going," answered Jack. He rang bell called his black servant, Monday. "What is de wind now, sah?" asked Monday. "Pack up. We going start North." That afternoon crossed bay steamer, taking steam-cars, reached Calistoga nightfall. In morning surprised hear "Four-in-Hand Foss" waiting outside hotel. Harkaway went down-stairs asked see Mr. Foss. He shown tall, handsome man, fifty sixty years age, well-known every tourist Pacific Slope. "Well, Mr. Foss," said Jack, introduction effected, "to I indebted honor visit?" "I heard arrived," replied Foss, "and intended visit Geysers. I road mountains, I reckoned I would drive myself." "Much obliged, I am sure." "You are welcome." "Have message me?" inquired Jack. "You are Harkaway, are not you?" "Yes." "Then I told tell would meet man search hills." "Is all?" "All." "Who told you?" "Well," said Foss, "he is fellow I have met around considerable, he called Nappa Bill." "Nappa Bill!" repeated Jack. "That is fellow I shot San Francisco." "Maybe--he wears one arm sling," replied Foss, carelessly. "Will breakfast me?" perused Jack. "I will take cocktail. Fact is, I am much eating to-day." "Why not? Has anything occurred take away appetite, may I ask?" "I am mourning five-hundred dollar horse died glanders, yesterday, is not ten one I do not spill coach I get hill." Jack invited breakfast-room introduced his companions. When eaten something got stage, drawn six horses. Foss best driver California, way he handled team quite fascinating Jack, could "handle ribbons" "tool pair tits" well next one. The distance Calistoga Fossville completed twenty-five minutes, stage rolling alarming manner. It arranged stay lunch, Mr. Foss indulged demonstrations grief five-hundred dollar horse. That say, he drank enough champagne float ordinary rowing-boat. At one of the clock started ascend mountains way Geysers. Harkaway perfectly charmed magnificent scenery he saw sides. So engrossed he contemplating wonders nature he see man spring middle road. Nor he notice half dozen men form line behind stage. These held blocks stone hands, Foss brought his horses standstill, placed stones behind wheels prevent stage slipping hill. They fully armed rifles pistols; knives peeped belts, faces wore air ferocious determination. "Halt!" cried leader. It command Foss stopped his horses. The leader wore his arm sling, Harkaway difficulty recognizing familiar features Nappa Bill. "Throw arms," continued leader. Jack looked round saw surrounded. "What shall do?" he asked Foss. "Got weaken," replied Foss. Mr. Mole appeared indignant drew pistol, he discharged Nappa Bill. The bullet missed mark, Bill laughed loudly. "Put iron, old fool," he said; "we want Jack Harkaway crowd, do not step out, right away, there will circus here, dead bodies it, mighty quick." "Look here," replied Foss. "I do not want people think I am thing. You give message take Calistoga gentleman, Mr. Harkaway, that is it." "That true, Foss; square make them." "Let us go on, then." "Not till Harkaway gets out." Harvey leveled his pistol Nappa Bill. "You scoundrel," he said; "take that." As before, bullet flew wide mark. "Ha, ha!" laughed Nappa Bill; "the ball is not molded yet hit me." Just one fired behind, Harvey fell stage bullet his shoulder. "My God, I am hit!" he cried. Jack rose up. "We overpowered," he exclaimed. "I wish friends suffer sake." "Surrender!" said Nappa Bill. Jack deliberately walked man threw his pistol. "This civilized State," he said. "You dare not murder me. Let friends go on, I become prisoner, I know hue cry day two California hot hold you." "That is say," replied robber, mockingly. Harkaway folded his arms stood his ground. "Drive on, Foss," said robber. "Who deuce you, anyway?" asked Four-in-Hand Foss. "Do want know, particularly?" "If I did not I should not ask." The robber drew proudly his full height. "I Vasquez, bandit," he cried. Foss indulged prolonged whistle. "Jerusalem!" he said, hitting his horses. "Git thar. That settles it. I did not count meeting Vasquez." "No hard feelings, old man," cried Vasquez, concealed his identity name Nappa Bill. "Not all, pard. So long." The horses started, stage went hill. Harkaway custody Vasquez his men, Mr. Mole, half frightened death, Harvey, dangerously wounded, slowly carried away, power Foss prevent consummation. Jack turned smilingly his captor, said: "Now, Mr. Vasquez, name, going me?" "My dear sir," replied Vasquez, celebrated bandit, whose crimes whole California excited, "I allow one else answer question." A man stepped forward. He concealed bush hitherto, directly Jack saw he recognized Lord Maltravers. "Mr. Harkaway," said Maltravers, "you kindly fallen little trap I laid you. It great pleasure I meet again, I shall send trip take South America." Jack turned pale. He saw foolish he despise power his lordship. "What mean you?" he asked. "Simply way diamond mines Brazil." "You cannot earnest?" "Never life, I assure you." "Villain!" Lord Maltravers twirled his mustache. "Yes," he replied, complacently, "I word implies." "But----" "I cannot waste time talking you. Pray excuse me," interrupted Maltravers. Vasquez, bandit, took hold Jack's arm led away. Six men pistols leveled followed side. Escape impossible. Lower road stage waiting, conveyed party two days coast. Jack put board sailing vessel. The captain named Moreland. "You orders?" said Vasquez Moreland. "Yes," replied captain; "my instructions writing." "See fulfilled letter." "I will." Vasquez left ship, Harkaway confined captain's cabin, he could amuse books papers. That afternoon ship sailed, Jack bound long voyage. Lord Maltravers triumphant again. Jack blamed yielding easily, he reflected he made resistance his whole party would killed. The odds great. Wondering Harvey much hurt, consoling reflection his friends knew look him, he lighted cigar he found table, waited Captain Moreland come him. CHAPTER VI. THE SLAVE OF THE DIAMOND MINES. The ship Jack Harkaway prisoner took general cargo Brazils. Captain Moreland put Jack his ease. He assured reason he treated harshly. The vessel two hours sea he requested his presence his cabin. Jack enviable position, he amicable frame mind, he felt he captain's power, would advisable treat civility. The colored steward placed couple bottles glasses table, well box cigars, retired. "Be seated," said captain. "You smoke, I presume?" "Yes," replied Jack. "Help yourself," continued Moreland, pushing box cigars him. "The wine port sherry; prefer?" Jack liked sherry, pledged one another. He good opportunity looking Moreland, spare, short man, reddish hair small, twinkling eyes, appeared treacherous expression. "I wish friend companion voyage," began Moreland. "Nothing would give greater pleasure," replied Jack. "Of course I need conceal anything you?" "It useless." "Well, I admit I paid handsomely Vasquez, bandit, convey Rio. He, I believe, employed enemy yours." "Precisely. I know that." "I shall enjoy society voyage, I see educated gentleman, companionship cannot fail agreeable." "Thank compliment," exclaimed Jack, could help thinking something lurking behind extraordinary civility. "When arrive Rio intimacy ceases, I shall discharge cargo, take another bags coffee, return 'Frisco." "Am I set free then?" "Certainly," answered Moreland. "I cannot understand that." "It simple enough. Your enemy wishes get way time. That all." "I heard," said Jack, "that I was, mysterious way, sent slave diamond mines." "Not me, events," laughed captain. "Are sure?" "Perfectly. My instructions simply land Rio, end duty regards you." Jack could make out. He forced, however, content assurance given Captain Moreland, conversation ended. There plenty books cabin. He messed Moreland. Everything he wanted placed his service, he really pleasant voyage round Cape Horn. The captain succeeded thoroughly gaining his confidence, he soon voted excellent fellow, he would sorry part time came. At length Rio reached, Jack almost without money, Moreland volunteered advance current expenses, taking return sight draft his agent San Francisco. When ship swung dock, bills lading given consignees, Moreland invited Jack dine him. "I know city," he remarked, "and take good place." Jack accepted invitation, walked together. As quitted ship, captain slipped something Harkaway's pocket, without action perceived. They walked restaurant indicated Moreland, Jack's suspicions returned he saw low part town. What his professed friend's object steering toward slums, he evidently doing? "Not savory neighborhood, this," he ventured observe. "No, amply compensated, friend, cooking, little hotel search of." "Oh, I comprehend," said Jack. "I prepared sacrifice great deal artistic cooking." They soon reached dingy-looking inn, waiters landlord nodded familiarly captain, he old customer. The room ushered dark dirty, table-cloths uninviting, directly Jack saw place he admonition coming evil. "Really," he remarked, "this bad Zola's _Assommoir_. I cannot congratulate taste." "Wait while," responded Moreland. "Landlord, bottle wine, best dinner get ready." "Si, signor," replied proprietor, swarthy, thick-set, beetle-browed Spaniard. The wine produced, seemed Jack peculiar flavor. Being thirsty, he drank heartily it, Moreland contented sipping it. "You do not drink?" observed Harkaway. "Excuse me, I rarely eating; takes away appetite." A dizziness began attack Jack, soft, sensuous, dreamy feeling stole him. What could mean? Had he brought place his kind friend, captain, drugged betrayed carefully set trap? Indeed, looked like it. "What time?" said captain. "I watch," replied Jack. "Vasquez kindly relieved trifle Nappa Valley." "I mine I left ship," continued Moreland, "and I one you." "What mean that?" asked Jack. It appeared latent accusation remark. "Oh, nothing," answered captain. "I report American Consul three, necessary I know time." He began search his pockets. Jack watched abstracted air, his stupor increased, seemed time much trouble speak. "Very odd watch mine gone to," continued Moreland. "Very," ejaculated Harkaway. "Are sure taken it?" "I?" Jack dumbfounded astonishment, could stare Moreland. "I must investigated," said latter. "Waiter!" "Signor?" "Call officer--quick!" Jack like one dream. He could believe he heard real. Some insidious drug mixed wine, like opium-eater, he seeing hearing things exist. Presently waiter returned policeman. "Who wants me?" he inquired. "I do. Arrest search man. I accuse stealing watch." He pointed Harkaway, officer approached. Jack endeavored rise strike his false friend, he seemed lost power his limbs. Obscured his intellect was, however, drugged wine, he saw he victim infamous plot, depth which, yet, he could scarcely gauge. Moreland his confidence prevent his making charge abduction arrival Rio. That clear enough. What follow remained coming events develop. The officer began search Jack, laughed half imbecile manner, good joke, made resistance. In his coat pocket found watch chain. "Is yours?" asked officer, holding up. "Yes. I swear it. Besides, name case. It present me. Oh! ingratitude people!" "Shall I arrest thief?" "Yes; lock up. I follow make complaint." Jack dragged rudely room police court, far off. Captain Moreland hastily settled bill followed his victim. A magistrate sitting bench, Jack soon specimen swiftly justice administered Brazil. Moreland told his story, stating he given prisoner passage San Francisco, he returned his kindness stealing his watch, influence liquor. "He drunk now," he added, "or perhaps he would done it." "Do press charge?" asked court. "It duty society so." Turning prisoner, court asked he anything say. Jack influence drug, whose effects made felt greater degree every minute. He thought he dreaming, continued laugh he thought excellent joke. "No," he replied. "I shall sentence five years' hard labor mines!" exclaimed magistrate. "That is right," replied Jack; "I knew coming." He laughed louder ever. The jailer took cell locked up. He soon fell profound slumber, he awake following morning. Captain Moreland perfectly satisfied, he fulfilled his contract his employer letter. There chance his victim's pardoned, little his escaping. Practically, he way five years, time Lord Maltravers could prosecute his plans regard Miss Vanhoosen. Perhaps hardships he would encounter mines might enfeeble his magnificent physique, kill his sentence expired. When Jack woke his cell he pressed his hand his aching head exclaimed: "Where deuce I?" He sat reflected. "Seems me," he continued, "I dream. Moreland invited dine; accused stealing his watch. Hang his impudence! I arrested, got five years mines. _Was_ dream?" A look cell convinced much dream terrible reality. The perspiration broke him, he began feel terribly alarmed. Presently jailer entered suit convict's clothes breakfast. "Eat dress," he said. "Certainly," replied Jack; "but let ask questions." "Be brief." "Am I convict?" "You are." "Is appeal? Cannot I communicate English American Consul?" "No time that," replied jailer. "In half hour chain-gang starts mines, one them." "For heaven's sake, something me!" The jailer shook his head. "I innocent," asseverated Jack. "The stolen property found you. It clear case. An angel could save you." "But I assure you, friend, I innocent. It base conspiracy I victim." "Eat dress!" said jailer, harshly. "In half hour I shall come fix chain you." With words he banged door hollow, sepulchral sound, Jack sounded like knell doom. He recognized fact he indeed slave. "Well," he muttered, "I must admit cleverly done; repine useless. I make best situation. Harvey, mortally wounded, come me. Thanks Elise said, friends know I am." He deliberately ate his breakfast, attired hideous yellow suit convict sent mines. In present hope. It future he look comfort, assistance freedom. Many wild tales he heard sufferings mines poor creatures condemned toil there. His heart sank within he recalled stories. Yet midst his misery fairy-like form Lena Vanhoosen would come him. She seemed ever bidding hope on, telling always darkest dawn. When half hour jailer, relentless fate itself, appeared, fastened chain around his ankle. In court-yard prison twenty unfortunates, similarly situated, assembled. They chained together, word "March," gate thrown open slowly filed out. Part journey performed railway, convicts special car, considerable distance traversed foot, painful toilsome. Every week ranks miners, depleted sickness death, reinforced fresh batches criminals. It seldom mine slave lasted longer five years. The wretches, cruelly tasked badly fed, broke perished miserably. The government worked mines benefit, entirely convict labor, made handsome profit it, labor cost nothing paid food, often diamonds large size, first water, great value found mines reached. The prisoners detailed certain sections, Jack work underground desperate-looking ruffian whose name Alfonso. The favored prisoners worked ground, receiving "dirt" came shafts, washing streams flowed sides mountains. These watched overseers, diamonds were, found, handed superintendents. The men worked couples, allowed talk. They three meals day coarse food, slept wooden huts night, laboring dawn dusk. Jack Alfonso supplied pickax, shovel basket. They first picked earth diamond-studded dirt, shoveled basket, afterward carrying nearest shaft, taken hand others, sent surface. "What for?" asked Alfonso. "They say I took man's watch, I got five years," replied Jack. "That is nothing," continued Alfonso; "I killed man, I sent 'down' life." Jack shuddered. He company murderer. "Do not I wish I could get away!" continued ruffian. "What would do?" asked Jack. "Can keep secret?" "I guess so." "I tried escape, soldiers, always guard, night day, saw fired. They brought down. I have bullet leg now." "Is so?" "Yes; did not get it," said Alfonso, laughing. "It? What mean 'it'?" "The diamond, lad. I have got biggest beauty ever came mines." "You have?" "Yes, sir. It is worth king's ransom. It ought crown royal personage. It is fit emperor." "Is fine?" "Magnificent. It is big Koh-i-noor, largest world. I shall never get out, though, use it?" He sighed deeply. "Why do not give authorities?" inquired Jack. "Can tell I should?" "No." "Do treat us well?" "No, indeed." "Are not slaves dogs, lead life utter hopeless misery?" "Very true." "They shall never it. No, lad. It is safe; I have taken fancy you, anything happens me, I want know is." Jack expressed his thankfulness proof convict's good will. "Where it?" he asked, his curiosity aroused. The convict bared his right leg advanced lamp gave light working. "Any one around?" he asked. "I cannot see one," replied Jack. "You never tell overseers come around. They are spy time." "We alone," Jack said. "See here, then." Alfonso took his hand placed his flesh. Jack felt lump skin. "What is that?" he asked. "The diamond," replied Alfonso, his breath. "Impossible! could get there?" Jack asked, incredulously. "Did not I tell brought bullet?" "Yes." "Well, saw lodged skin, brutes did not think worth get doctor cut out. A day two afterward I found diamond." "Well?" "So I takes knife cuts myself, seeing room bullet, I shoved diamond hole let skin grow now." "In body?" "In living body," replied Alfonso, "and word lie it." "Did not hurt?" "I will bet did. I suffered tortures damned weeks, hurts I strain lie side." Jack overpowered astonishment. "You have got grit you," he remarked. "Did not I tell I killed man? Any one who is got pluck enough slay his enemy risk gallows anything," answered Alfonso. "What want do?" inquired Jack. "If I die, cut out." "And then?" "Hide somewhere. I cannot tell where. We must think." Suddenly mine-boss came along, gentle, cat-like footsteps. "What two skulking for?" he asked, exhibiting rattan, his badge office. "Who is skulking?" asked Alfonso, savagely. "You are." The murderer looked foreboding gleam his eye. "Pedro," he said, "I warned interfere me." "It duty." "Let alone; I am desperate man, I would soon dead working here. Do understand?" "I understand threatening me," answered Pedro, "and I shall report you." This "report" meant fifty lashes bare back prisoner, delivered publicly retiring rest. Alfonso gnashed his teeth savagely. "Take care," he said. "I shall report twice instantly go work." This intended convey fact punishment would doubled, number lashes increased one hundred. Alfonso's eyes glared like wild beast. Jack shrank back, he felt sure terrible tragedy take place. In case disobedience reported overseers, convicts unmercifully flogged rawhide, Alfonso treated kind discipline twice his period incarceration. What wonder man condemned life degrading drudgery, hope commutation his sentence, could expect die his chains, rebel he thought persecuted authority him? "I warned you," said Alfonso, strangled voice. "And I warned you," replied keeper. "Recollect I already killed one man." "Bah!" replied Pedro, keeper, drawing pistol. "If much raise little finger toward me, I would stretch corpse floor." "What I let you?" asked Pedro, sneer peculiarly aggravating. Alfonso breathed heavily. "Do mean report me?" he demanded. "Certainly I do, know well means." "Yes--I--do," answered convict--speaking difficulty. "Shall I tell you?" "No need it; back bears record." "For two days succession, friend," exclaimed Pedro, seemed take pleasure tormenting convict, "you flogged presence companions." Alfonso's herculean frame trembled, he shook like aspen leaf. "God!" he cried, uplifting his eyes dark rock him, "my time come--and his." With wild gasp he sprang upon Pedro. Harkaway would interfered, he saw useless make attempt separate them. It duel death two men. He would endangered his life done good. Pedro discharged his pistol, he threatened do, Alfonso received bullet his left shoulder without flinching. With his right hand he drove sharp point his pick skull keeper. Pedro fell groan. Again infuriated convict struck until, his mad frenzy, he smashed his skull jelly. "What done?" asked Jack. "Settled him, way. There one mine-boss gone, world rid another petty tyrant," replied Alfonso. "And become you?" "I shall solve great problem, friend," said convict, double murderer. He stooped picked pistol Pedro allowed drop his hand. "You mean take life?" "That precisely I mean." "How?" "Look here!" exclaimed Alfonso. "I take sensible man, though young. What I, slave, live for? Is pleasure exist, I existing last year, since I infernal place?" "No, I admit that; but----" "What?" "While life hope." "Not I. Have I killed man, almost self-defense, I may say?" "I admit it." "Well, I live hours seize me, flog till I dying condition, hang me. Why I die now?" Harkaway could see valid reason he prolong his miserable forfeited existence. "You right," he said. "It clear suicide case atonement, virtue." "Comrade," exclaimed Alfonso, "they say die see future events clearly." "I heard that," replied Jack. "I see free happy." "Ha!" cried Jack. "When?" "Before long. I congratulate you. Do forget I told diamond." "I not." "Cut soon I dead, give alarm mouth shaft." "I will; shall I put it?" Alfonso looked wildly around him. "I do not know. I cannot tell," he replied. "My brain whirl. I hear strange voices ringing ears. Angels talking me. I conversing spirits mighty dead bid come them." Jack saw man crazed. His troubles his hard lot weakened his mind, he longer responsible his actions. What ought he circumstances? If he snatched pistol his hand, he would run risk shot, would charity poor wretch save his life order that, cruelly torturing him, authorities mines might take hours. Holding his hand, he said: "Good-by." The murderer grasped warmly. "You say good-by! Have anything add?" he asked. "Yes. God bless and----" Jack hesitated. "What?" "Forgive you, His Son's sake." "Good! _Adios_, signor." These last words Alfonso spoke, he placed muzzle pistol his right temple fired. There loud report, gave cavernous echoes, thick smoke, nearly obscured light lamp, murderer fell prostrate corpse mine boss. The bullet done work well. He died without word, sigh, groan. CHAPTER VII. MISS VANHOOSEN TRAVELS. Lord Maltravers took care papers, containing account Harkaway's adventure private box California theatre Elise Holt reach Miss Vanhoosen. Lena read account surprise indignation. "He cannot love me," she said, "or he would intrigue married woman." She tried harden her heart men general, Jack particular. It singular she could succeed, however, she confess herself she still loved him. A copy paper also sent Mrs. Vanhoosen, gloried it. "My dear child," she exclaimed, "what I always tell man?" "I know never liked him, mamma." "Is judgment verified now?" "Perhaps," replied Lena, "though one ought always believe one reads papers." "Why not?" "Oh, untrustworthy nine times ten," said Lena, wished defend her absent lover, matter strong proofs might him. "You married Maltravers." "How could I, he wife alive? What nonsense talk, mamma! He killed poor creature, he ever caught he hanged." "Not all," answered Mrs. Vanhoosen. "I letter him, he says he return England. No one cares prosecute him. Who send him? Is district-attorney going expense extraditing him?" "Really, mamma, I know, I do not care argue point you," said Lena, weary air. "Why not?" "It fatigues me." "You marry Lord Maltravers." "I shall never marry now," answered Lena. "I intend devote life single blessedness." "Why so?" "Because----" She paused abruptly. "I know would say," exclaimed Mrs. Vanhoosen. "This man Harkaway, love, proved unworthy you, I always said he was, therefore close heart every one." "Have way." "Are foolish?" "Mamma," said Lena, sudden energy, "if taunt I go convent." "Indeed, not. I insist upon visiting Europe again," replied Mrs. Vanhoosen. "What I refuse?" "I disown you; turn street, shift yourself, ungrateful girl," replied her mother, passionately. "You expect I meet Maltravers marry him, occurred?" "I do." "Then greatly mistaken," said Lena, obstinately. "My dear child," continued her mother, "consider losing. If meet Maltravers Paris, get married, he wife alive now, go live Switzerland, quiet place, till affair blown over." "Never!" At moment Alfred Vanhoosen, absent Albany little time, entered room. His presence unexpected, welcome flowers May Lena, dearly loved her brother. She knew he times her friend her protector. "Alfred!" she exclaimed, grasping his hand, "I glad see you!" "And I see you, sis. Mamma, you?" "Ailing, dear," replied Mrs. Vanhoosen. "My head troubled much since away." "Sorry that. What got hand, sissy?" "A California paper." "I thought much. What about?" asked Alfred. "That affair Mr. Harkaway's, San Francisco," replied Lena. "Oho! Is all? You seen _Chronicle_ later date?" "No." He produced paper, he pointed her certain paragraph. "I presume," he exclaimed, "that Lord Maltravers sends papers his purposes." "Possibly," she answered, beginning read. "Who sends papers you?" asked Mrs. Vanhoosen, sharply. "Dick Harvey keeps posted, I know going on. This game chess Harkaway Maltravers, I sorry say his lordship first two moves game." "Glad it!" replied Mrs. Vanhoosen. "No, mother," said Alfred, "you glad heart." "Why not?" "Because much lady Christian wish see scoundrel triumph honest man." Mrs. Vanhoosen sat lounge fanned herself vigorous manner. She condescend make reply. Lena read paragraph her brother pointed her, learnt startling facts. It stated Harkaway his friends stopped way Geysers Vasquez celebrated bandit, scourge California long time. Harvey dangerously wounded, Jack carried off, nobody knew where. When she fully mastered contents news item, Lena uttered loud cry. Her mother looked her astonishment. "My dear child!" she exclaimed, "what matter?" "Jack captured bandits," replied Lena. "Oh! shall I--what ought I do?" "Shall I tell you, sis?" asked Alfred. "Oh! yes." Mrs. Vanhoosen rose extended her hand. "Allow opportunity speak, please," she said. "Certainly," replied Alfred; "you mother, bound hear you, although I must say I Lena's place I would go Jack." "Insolent boy!" "No, mother, I insolent; girl loves man, use interfering them?" "She shall marry him!" "I do not want undutiful go fifth commandment, mother, tells us, properly, honor father mother; but, really, wrong case." "Why, may I ask?" "Mr. Harkaway honorable elegant gentleman every sense word, means pauper. He support Lena well supported her, reason he marry her." Mrs. Vanhoosen tried speak, her rising temper rendered her speechless. Lena began cry, put her handkerchief eyes. "Oh!" she sobbed; "I shall never see again." Alfred Vanhoosen patted her cheek brotherly affection. "Yes, will, sis," he replied. "Oh, no! never, never!" "I beg pardon. Jack man easy kill, I do not think Maltravers get away easily he thinks." "God grant it." "At rate," continued Alfred, "I proceed San Francisco search him." "You will?" "Yes, indeed." Lena seized hand looked imploringly his face. "Take you," she exclaimed. "I shall die I stay here. This life intolerable me." Alfred looked his mother, he expected reproach proud, ambitious woman. She really bad-hearted, she like many mothers United States desire daughters marry man Europe title rather one race, least, one nothing his face his character recommend him. "You thankless child, conduct sharper serpent's tooth," said Mrs. Vanhoosen. Lena held her hand. "Mamma," she exclaimed, "we must part." "What! I deserted children?" "Alas! yes. We cannot live together. There sympathy us. My love calls far away." Mrs. Vanhoosen became angry. Her face flushed. She tried speak, failed. Suddenly she uttered cry. Something seemed burst her throat. She fell ground heavily. A stream blood rushed her mouth. In her anger she broken blood-vessel, her life danger. Lena, greatly alarmed, knelt supported her parent's head. A doctor sent for, he he could unhappy woman, internal hemorrhage, lingering three days, she died. Though brother sister deeply grieved mother's death, could blame her untimely end. By her she divided her fortune equally them. After funeral, largely attended numerous friends New York, decided go California unravel mystery attended fate Jack Harkaway. The journey across continent delightful. Everything new forgot grief happy. CHAPTER VIII. THE ESCAPE FROM THE MINES. Alfonso, desperate murderer, effectually put end his earthly sufferings. Jack quickly recovered shock his death given him. Taking knife he accustomed eat his dinner, he searched spot man's leg he claimed hidden diamond. It little hope finding he so. The whole story seemed like delirious ravings madman. Cutting away skin, hard substance fell out, Jack picked up. He work mines long enough know diamond was. Holding light, he uttered cry surprise, he saw he possessor jewel first water prodigious size. Alfonso lied him. The story invention maniac, solemn fact. What he it? This question could decided off-hand, he slipped his pocket, reflection he yet half day think matter out. The convicts searched night, retiring quarters. He running great risk, he knew it. If diamond found upon person convict he instantly shot. Not even drum-head court-martial held upon him.
