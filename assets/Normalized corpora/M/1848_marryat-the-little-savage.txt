 THE LITTLE SAVAGE Chapter I I write curious history, reader agree he read book. We one narrative people cast away upon desolate islands, left resources, works perhaps read interest; I believe I first instance boy left alone upon uninhabited island. Such was, however, case; I shall tell story. My first recollections are, I company man upon island, walked often along sea-shore. It rocky difficult climb many parts, man used drag pull dangerous places. He unkind me, may appear strange, I companion he had; he morose gloomy disposition. He would sit squatted corner cabin, sometimes speak hours--or he would remain whole day looking sea, watching something, I never could tell; I spoke, he would reply; near him, I sure receive cuff heavy blow. I imagine I five years old time I first recollect clearly passed. I may younger. I may well state I gathered different times, relative left upon desolate spot. It difficulty I so; for, generally speaking, he would throw stone I asked questions, is, I repeatedly asked he refused answer. It one occasion, he lying sick, I gained information, refusing attend bring food water. He would angry, say, he got well again, he would make smart it; I cared not, I getting strong, whilst he getting weaker every day, I love him, he never shown me, always treated great severity. He told me, twelve years (not I knew he meant year, I never heard term used him), English ship (I know ship was) swamped near island, heavy gale, seven men one woman saved, people lost. That ship broken pieces, saved nothing--that picked among rocks pieces wood made, built cabin lived. That one died another, buried (what death burial meant, I idea time), I born island; (How I born? thought I)--that died I two years old; then, he mother two left besides me. My mother died months afterwards. I obliged ask many questions understand this; indeed, I understand till long afterwards, although I idea he would say. Had I left person, I should, course, conversation, learnt much; he never would converse, still less explain. He called me, Boy, I called him, Master. His inveterate silence occasion language composed words; for, except order that, procure required, he never would converse. He however mutter himself, talk his sleep, I used lie awake listen, I might gain information; first, I grew older. He used cry his sleep constantly.--"A judgment, judgment sins, heavy sins--God merciful!" But judgment, sin was, God, I know, although I mused words repeated often. I describe island, way lived. The island small, perhaps three miles round; rock, beach landing place, sea washing sides deep water. It was, I afterwards discovered, one group islands Peruvians despatch vessels every year collect guano, refuse sea birds resort islands; one small, detached distance others, guano found great profusion; hitherto neglected, vessel ever come near it. Indeed, islands seen except clear day, appeared like cloud mist horizon. The shores island were, moreover, precipitous, landing place, eternal wash ocean would made almost impossible vessel taken cargo. Such island upon I found company man. Our cabin built ship-plank timber, shelter cliff, fifty yards water; flat thirty yards square front it, cliff trickled rill water, fell hole dug collect it, found way flat rocks beneath. The cabin large, capable holding many people ever lived it; large, secure provisions many months. There several bed-places level floor, rendered soft enough lie on, filled feathers birds. Furniture none, except two three old axes, blunted long use, tin pannikin, mess kid rude vessels hold water, cut wood. On summit island forest underwood, bushes extended distance ravines led summit shore. One arduous tasks climb ravines collect wood, fortunately fire often required. The climate warm year round, seldom fall rain; fall, generally expended summit island, reach us. At certain period year, birds came island numberless quantities breed, chief resort tolerably level ground--indeed, many places, quite level accumulation guano--which ground divided spot cabin built deep ravine. On spot, might perhaps contain twenty acres more, sea birds would sit upon eggs, four inches apart other, whole surface twenty acres would completely covered them. There would remain time laying eggs, young ones able leave nests fly away them. At season birds island, gaiety, bustle, noise, departure quiet solitude. I used long arrival, delighted animation gladdened island, male birds diving every direction fish, wheeling soaring air, uttering loud cries, responded mates nests. But also harvest time; seldom touched old birds, flesh, soon young ones within days leaving nests, busy enough. In spite screaming flapping wings faces, darting beaks eyes, old birds, robbed progeny, collected hundreds every day, bore heavy load could carry across ravine platform front cabin, busied skinning them, splitting them, hanging dry sun. The air island pure putrefaction ever took place, last fortnight birds coming island, collected sufficiency support return following year. As soon quite dry packed corner cabin use. These birds were, may said, produce island, exception fish, eggs taken time first making nests. Fish taken large quantities. It sufficient put line rocks, hardly time go fathom anything end seized. Indeed, means taking simple voracity great. Our lines composed sinews legs man-of-war birds, I afterwards heard named; and, foot long, required great many knotted together make line. At end line bait fixed strong fish-bone, fastened line middle; half-hitch line round one end kept bone parallel line bait seized, line taughtened, half-hitch slipped bone remained crossways gullet fish, drawn it. Simple contrivance was, answered well best hook, I never seen one time. The fish strong large, that, I young, man would allow attempt catch them, lest pull water; but, I grew bigger, I could master them. Such food one year's end other; variety, except occasionally broiled dried birds fish upon embers, instead eating dried sun. Our raiment, was, also indebted feathered tribe for. The birds skinned feathers on, skins sewn together sinews, fish-bone way needle. These garments durable, climate fine suffer cold season year. I used make new dress every year birds came; time returned, I little left last year's suit, fragments might found among rocky steep parts ravine used collect firing. Living life, wants, periodically easily supplied, hardly varied one year's end another, may easily imagined I ideas. I might more, companion taciturn morose habit; was, I looked wide ocean, sky, sun, moon, stars, wondering, puzzled, afraid ask questions, ending sleeping away large portion existence. We tools except old ones, useless--no employment kind. There book, I asked was, I got answer. It remained upon shelf, I looked I ordered away, last I regarded sort fear, kind incomprehensible animal. The day passed idleness almost silence; perhaps dozen sentences exchanged twenty-four hours. My companion always same, brooding something appeared ever occupy his thoughts, angry roused his reverie. Chapter II The reader must understand foregoing remarks considered referring position amount knowledge I seven eight years old. My master, I called him, short square-built man, sixty years age, I afterwards estimated recollection comparison. His hair fell his back thick clusters still dark color, his beard full two feet long bushy; indeed, he covered hair, wherever his person exposed. He was, I say, powerful he occasion exert his strength, exception time collected birds, occasionally going ravine bring faggots wood, he seldom moved cabin unless bathe. There pool salt water twenty yards square, near sea, separated low ridge rocks, waves beat sea rough wind side island. Every morning almost went bathe pool, secure sharks, numerous. I could swim like fish early I recollect, whether I taught, learnt myself, I cannot tell. Thus life passed away; duties trifling; I little nothing employ about, I means employment. I seldom heard human voice, became taciturn companion. My amusements equally confined--looking depths ocean, I lay rocky wall girded major portion island, watching motions finny tribes below, wondering stars night season, eating, sleeping. Thus I pass away existence without pleasure without pain. As thoughts I hardly say, knowledge ideas confined food thought. I little better beast field, lies pasture he filled. There one great source interest however, was, listen sleeping talk companion, I always looked forward time night fell repaired beds. I would lie awake hours, listening his ejaculations murmured speech, trying vain find meaning he would say--but I gained little; he talked "that woman"--appearing constantly men, muttering something he hidden away. One night, moon shining bright, he sat his bed, which, I said, floor cabin, throwing aside feathers upon he lying, scratched mould away lifted piece board. After minute he replaced everything, lay again. He evidently sleeping whole time. Here, last, something feed thoughts with. I heard say his sleep he hidden something--this must hiding place. What it? Perhaps I ought observe feelings towards man positive dislike, hatred; I never received one kind word deed him, I could recollect. Harsh unfeeling towards me, evidently looking upon ill-will, suffering I saved trouble, perhaps he wished living thing his companion,--his feelings towards reciprocated mine towards him. What age I time mother died, I know not, I faint recollection one treated kindness caresses, recollections became forcible dreams, I saw figure different companion (a female figure) hanging leading hand. How I used try continue dreams, closing eyes I woke up! And yet I knew brought dim recollection infancy; I knew figure appeared shadow mother; I loved dreams I treated kindly them. But change took place hand Providence. One day, laid yearly provision sea birds, I busy arranging skins old birds, flat rock, annual garment, joined together something like sack, holes head arms pass through; when, I looked seaward, I saw large white object water. "Look, master," said I, pointing towards it. "A ship, ship!" cried companion. "Oh," thought I, "that ship; I recollect he said came ship." I kept eyes her, she rounded to. "Is she alive?" inquired I. "You are fool," said man; "come help pile wood may make signal her. Go fetch water throw it, may plenty smoke. Thank God, I may leave cursed hole last!" I hardly understood him, I went water brought mess kid. "I want wood yet," said he. "Her head way, she come nearer." "Then she alive," said I. "Away, fool!" said he, giving cuff head; "get water throw wood." He went cabin strike light, he obtained piece iron flint, fine dry moss tinder. While he employed, eyes fixed vessel, wondering could be. It moved water, turned way that. "It must alive," thought I; "is fish bird?" As I watched vessel, sun going hour's daylight. The wind light variable, accounted vessel often altering her course. My companion came his hands full smoking tinder, putting wood, busy blowing flame. The wood soon set fire to, smoke ascended several feet air. "They will see that," said he. "What then, eyes? must alive. Does mind wind?" inquired I, answer first remark, "for look there, little clouds coming fast," I pointed horizon, small clouds rising were, I knew experience constantly watching sky, sign short violent gale, tornado, usually one, two, season year. "Yes; confound it," replied companion, grinding his teeth, "it blow her off! That is luck." In meantime, smoke ascended air vessel approached nearer nearer, she within, I suppose, two miles island, fell quite calm. My companion threw water increase smoke, vessel hauling her courses, I perceived people board, I arranging ideas vessel might be, companion cried out--"They see us, see us! there is hope now. Confound it, I have long enough. Hurrah old England!" he commenced dancing capering like madman. At last he said, "Look see she sends boat, I go cabin." "What is boat?" said I. "Out, fool! tell see anything," "Yes, I see something," replied I. "Look squall coming along water, soon; see thick clouds getting up: shall much wind rain time last, birds came." "Confound it," replied he, "I wish they would lower boat, events;" saying, he went cabin, I perceived he busy his bed-place. My eyes still fixed upon squall, I watched advancing furious speed surface water; first deep black line horizon, approached vessel, changed white; surface water still smooth. The clouds ten degrees horizon, although thick opaque--but season year, tornadoes, I may call them, visited us; sometimes one, sometimes more, gusts came rain below. On board vessel--I speak knowledge--they appear aware danger; sails set flapping masts. At last, I perceived small object close vessel; I presumed boat companion looked for. It like young vessel close old one, I said nothing; I watching wondering effect rising wind would upon her, observations companion made feel important. After time, I perceived white sails disappearing, forms men busy, moving board, boat went back side vessel. The fact is, perceived squall late, another moment almost, I saw vessel bowed fury gale, that, mist great I could not see her more. "Is she sending boat, boy?" cried companion. "I cannot see her," replied I; "for she hidden wind." As I said this, tornado reached stood, threw legs entrance cabin; wind came torrent rain, drenched us, clouds covered whole firmament, became dark; lightning darted every direction, peals thunder deafening. I crawled cabin, rain beat great fury flowed small river. My companion sat near me, lowering silent. For two hours tornado lasted without interruption; sun set, darkness opaque. It impossible move force wind deluge water descended. Speak, not, shut eyes lightning, held fingers ears deaden noise thunder, burst upon us awful manner. My companion groaned intervals, whether fear, I know not; I fear, I know danger, God judge earth. Gradually fury gale abated, rain heavy intervals, could hear beating waves, dashed rocks beneath us. The sky also cleared little, could dimly discern white foam breakers. I crawled cabin, stood upon platform front, straining eyes see vessel. A flash lightning, second, revealed her me; she dismasted, rolling awful breakers, bore her upon high rocks, quarter mile her. "There is," exclaimed I, disappearance lightning left darkness, opaque ever. "She is done for," growled companion, who, I till aware, stood side. "No hopes time, confound it!" Then he continued time curse swear awfully, I afterwards discovered, I know cursing swearing. "There she again," said I, another flash lightning revealed position vessel. "Yes, she will not long; five minutes she will dashed atoms, every soul perish." "What souls?" inquired I. My companion gave reply. "I go rocks," said I, "and see goes on." "Go," said he, "and share fate." Chapter III I left him, commenced careful descent precipices surrounded, but, I gone fifty paces, another flash lightning followed loud shriek, arrested steps. Where noise came from, I could tell, I heard companion calling come back. I obeyed him, found standing I left him. "You called me, master?" "Yes, I did; take hand, lead cabin." I obeyed him, wondering he asked do. He gained his bed-place, threw it. "Bring kid full water," said he--"quick!" I brought it, he bathed his head face. After time, he threw back upon bed-place, groaned heavily. "O God! it is me," said he last. "I shall live die cursed hole." "What is matter, master?" said I. He gave answer, lay groaning occasionally cursing. After time, he still, I went again. The tornado over, stars seen there, still wind strong wild clouds flew fast. The shores island one mass foam, dashed high air fell upon black rocks. I looked vessel, could see nothing--the day evidently dawning, I sat waited coming. My companion apparently asleep, he lay without motion noise. That misfortune happened, I convinced, what, I knew not, I passed long time conjecture, dividing thoughts vessel. At last daylight appeared--the weather moderating fast, although waves still beat furiously rocky shore. I could see nothing vessel, I descended path, slippery insecure heavy fall rain, went near edge rocks breaking billows would permit. I walked along, occasionally drenched spray, I arrived I last seen vessel. The waves dashing tossing about, sport, fragments timber, casks, spars; I could see, except mast rigging, lay alongside rocks, sometimes appearing summit waves, descending far sight, I dared venture near enough edge look over. "Then vessel dashed pieces, companion said," thought I. "I wonder she made." I remained hour rocks, turned back cabin. I found companion awake, groaning heavily. "There ship," said I, "nothing pieces wood floating about." "I know that," replied he; "but I care now?" "I thought making smoke, care." "Yes, I then, I blind, I shall never see ship anything else again. God help me! I shall die rot cursed island." "Blind, blind?" inquired I. "The lightning burned eyes, I see nothing--I cannot help myself--I cannot walk about--I cannot anything, I suppose leave die like dog." "Cannot see me?" "No, dark, dark night, long I live." And he turned his bed-place groaned. "I hope, I lived hope--it kept alive many weary years, hope gone, I care I die to-morrow." And he started turned his face towards me, I saw light his eyes. "Bring water, hear?" said he, angrily. "Be quick, I will make you." But I fully comprehended his condition, powerless he was. My feelings, I said, anything cordial towards him, renewed violence threatening manner effect. I now, I suppose, twelve thirteen years old--strong active. I felt inclined rebel, measure strength his. Irritated, therefore, his angry language, I replied-- "Go water yourself." "Ah!" sighed he, pause seconds, "that I might expected. But let get hands, I will make remember it." "I care I hands," replied I; "I strong you." For I thought many day, meant prove it. "Indeed! well, come here, let us try." "No, no," replied I; "I am fool say I am--not I am afraid you; I shall axe hand always ready, find another." "I wish I tossed cliffs child," said he, bitterly, "instead nursing bringing up." "Then kind me? As far back I remember always treated ill; made work you; yet never even spoken kindly me. I wanted know things, never answered questions, called fool, told hold tongue. You made hate you, often told hated me--you know have." "It is true, quite true," replied he, talking himself. "I done he says, I hated him. But I because. Come here, boy." "No," replied I; "do come here. You master, I boy, long enough. Now I master boy, shall find so." Having said this, I walked cabin left him. He cried out, "Do not leave me," I heeded not, sat edge fiat ledge rock cabin. Looking white dancing waves, deep thoughts, I considered long I behave towards him. I wish die, I knew he must I left him. He could obtain water rill without great chance falling cliff. In fact, I fully aware his helpless state; prove myself, I rose shut eyes; tried I could venture move dangerous ground, I felt sure I could not. He power; he could nothing; he must trust almost everything. I said, let would follow, I would master he boy; could be, I must still attend upon him, he would die. At last thought came suddenly upon me--I master, nevertheless, he shall answer questions, tell he knows, he shall starve. He power. He shall I ever tried make do, he ever refused. Having thus arranged plans, I returned cabin, said him: "Hear I say--I kind you, leave starve, I ask." "And that?" replied he. "For long I asked many questions, refused answer them. Instead telling I would know, beaten thrown stones me, called names, threatened me. I give choice--either shall promise answer every question I put you, may live can, I shall leave help yourself. If I wish, I I help you, not, thank may happen. Recollect, I master now; take choice." "Well," replied he slowly, "it is judgment upon me, I must agree it. I wish." "Well, then, begin," said I, "I often asked name was, mine. I must call something, Master I not, I master now. What name?" He groaned, ground his teeth, said, "Edward Jackson." "Edward Jackson! well; name?" "No, I cannot bear name. I cannot say it," replied he, angrily. "Be so," replied I. "Then I leave you." "Will bring water eyes? burn," said he. "No, I not, anything else, unless tell name." "Frank Henniker--and curses it." "Frank Henniker. Well, shall water." I went out, filled kid, put his side, "There water, Jackson; want anything, call me. I shall outside." "I gained mastery," thought I,--"it turn now. He do not like answer, he shall, he shall starve. Why he feel angry name? Henniker! meaning Henniker, I wonder? I make tell me. Yes, he shall tell everything." I may observe, pity compassion, I know feelings. I ill-treated, I felt might right; right I determined upon exercising utmost. I felt inconceivable pleasure idea master, he boy. I felt love power, pride superiority. I revolved mind daily task I would set him, he receive his daily sustenance. He talk much I pleased, I master. I treated slave, I fully prepared play tyrant. Mercy compassion I knew not. I never seen called forth, I felt not. I sat flat rock time, occurred I would turn course water fell hole edge cliff; he crawled there, he would able obtain any. I so, emptied hole. The water obtained climbing up, his power obtain drop. Food, course, he could obtain, dried birds piled farther end cabin, I could well remove them; food without water? I turning mind first question put him; I decided I would full particular account vessel wrecked island, father mother, I named Henniker--when I roused hearing Jackson (as I shall future call him) crying out, "Boy, boy!" "Boy, indeed," thought I--"no longer boy," I gave reply. Again he called, last he cried out, "Henniker," I ruffled his calling boy, I would answer him. At last he fairly screamed name, silent. After moment, I perceived he crawled his bed-place, feeling sides cabin, contrived his hands knees crawl direction hole water previously received; I smiled I knew would his disappointment he arrived there. He last: put his hand feel edge hole, feel water; he found none, he cursed bitterly, I laughed his vexation. He felt way water fallen, found course stopped, he dared attempt anything further. He dashed his clenched hand rock. "Oh! I grasp--if one moment. I would care I died next." "I doubt you," replied I him, above, "but got hands, not. Go bed directly--quick," cried I, throwing piece rock him, hit head. "Crawl back fast can, fool, I will send another head directly. I will tame you, used say me." The blow head appeared confused him; time he crawled back his bed-place, threw heavy groan. Chapter IV I went water's edge see I could find anything wreck, water smooth, longer washed rocks island. Except fragments wood, I perceived nothing I arrived pool accustomed bathe; I found sea thrown two articles large dimensions--one cask size puncheon, lay foot water farthest seaward; seaman's chest. What things I know, I wish reader recollect great portion narrative compiled knowledge. The cask firm sand, I could move it. The chest floating; I hauled rocks without difficulty, proceeded open it. It time I could discover how, I never seen lock, hinge life; last, finding lid portion chest yielded, I contrived, piece rock, break open. I found quantity seamen's clothes, upon I put value; articles I immediately comprehended use of, filled delight. There two new tin pannikins, would hold water. There three empty wine bottles, hammer, chisel, gimlet, tools, also three four fishing-lines many fathoms long. But pleased two knives, one shutting up, lanyard sheath wear round waist; American long knife, sheath, usually worn belt. Now, three four years back, Jackson remains clasp knife--that is, inch blade remaining--and this, may supposed, he valued much; indeed, miserable article was, destitute state invaluable. This knife he laid rock fishing, dragged sea his line ran out; he many days inconsolable loss. We used cutting open birds skinned them, and, indeed remains knife always request. Since loss it, hard work get skins birds; I therefore well knew value knives, I immediately secured. The remainder articles chest, quite full, I laid upon rocks, clothes, dry; I know use, consequently prize time. It afterwards, I taken companion, I learned value. I may well observe, amongst articles two books, and, positive commands companion, touch book cabin, I looked upon degree awe, hesitated upon taking hand; but, last, I put dry rocks, rest contents chest. I felt knives, blades sharp; I put lanyard clasp knife round neck; sheath knife, formidable weapon, I made fast round waist, piece fishing lines, I cut off; I turned steps towards cabin, night coming on, though moon high heavens, shining brightly. On return, I found Jackson his bed-place; he heard come in, asked me, quiet tone, whether I would bring water? I answered, "No, I would not, he said me, he would do, he got his power. I will tame you," cried I. "I am master now, shall find." "You may be," replied he, quickly, "but still, reason let water. Did I ever prevent water?" "You never fetch me," I rejoined, "or would taken trouble. What trouble would take me, I blind now, you? I become use you, would leave die. You let live might make work you, beat cruelly. It is turn now--you are boy, I am master." The reader must remember I know meaning word "boy"; idea was, opposition "master," boy, me, idea word "slave." "Be so," replied he, calmly. "I shall want water long." There quietness Jackson made suspect him, consequence was, although I turned bed-place, ground side cabin opposite his, I feel inclined go sleep, remained awake, thinking passed. It towards morning I heard move; face turned way, I occasion stir watch his motions. He crept softly his bed-place towards me, listening, advancing his knees, foot every ten seconds. "You want grasp," thought I, "come along," I drew American knife sheath, without noise, awaited his approach, smiling surprise he would meet with. I allowed come right me; he felt side bed, passed his right hand seize me. I caught his right hand left, passing knife across his wrist, half divided his arm. He gave shriek surprise pain, fell back. "He knife," exclaimed he, surprise, holding his severed wrist hand. "Yes, he knife, one," replied I, "and see he knows use it. Will come again? believe I am master?" "If charity mercy, kill once," said he, he sat moonlight, centre floor cabin. "Charity mercy," said I, "what they? I never heard them." "Alas! no," replied he, "I shewed none--it is judgment me--a judgment many sins; Lord, forgive me! First eyes, right hand useless. What next, O Lord Heaven?" "Why, hand next," replied I, "if try again." Jackson made reply. He attempted crawl back his bed, but, faint loss blood, he dropped senseless floor cabin. I looked him, satisfied he would make attempts upon me, I turned away, fell fast asleep. In two hours, I awoke, looking round, perceived lying floor, he fallen night before. I went examined him--was he asleep, he dead? He lay pool blood. I felt him, he quite warm. It ghastly cut his wrist, I thought, he dead, he never tell I want know. I knew he bound cuts stop blood. I took feathers bed, put handful wound. After I done it, I bound his wrist piece fishing-line I taken secure sheath knife round waist, I went water. I poured his throat; revived him, he opened his eyes. "Where I?" said he faintly. "Where you?--why, cabin," said I. "Give water." I so, I wish kill him. I wanted live, power. After drinking water he roused himself, crawled back his bed-place. I left then, went bathe. The reader may exclaim--What horrid tyrant boy is--why, he bad his companion. Exactly--I so--but let reader reflect I made education. From time I could first remember, I tyrannised over; cuffed, kicked, abused ill-treated. I never known kindness. Most truly question put me, "Charity mercy--what they?" I never heard them. An American Indian kind feelings--he hospitable generous--yet, educated inflict, receive, severest tortures from, his enemies, he first savage vindictive feelings, submits latter indifference stoicism. He has, indeed, kindlier feelings his nature exercised; still, changes not. He earliest infancy brought cruelty, he cannot feel wrong. Now, position worse. I never seen softer feelings nature called play; I knew nothing tyranny oppression, hatred vengeance. It therefore surprising that, turn came, I others I done by. Jackson excuse his treatment me, whereas, I every excuse retaliation. He know better, I not. I followed ways world petty microcosm I placed. I knew mercy, forgiveness, charity, goodwill. I knew God; I knew might right, pleasurable sensation I felt, anxiety vengeance, combined consciousness power. After I bathed, I examined chest contents. I looked books without touching them. "I must know mean," thought I, "and I know." My thirst knowledge certainly remarkable, boy age; I presume simple reason, want cannot obtain; Jackson invariably refused enlighten subject, I became anxious impatient satisfy longing increased growth. Chapter V For three days Jackson lie his bed; I supplied water, he eat anything. He groaned heavily times, talked much himself, I heard ask forgiveness God, pardon his sins. I noted explanation. On third day, he said me, "Henniker, I ill. I fever coming on, wound given me. I say I deserve it, I did, I know I treated ill, must hate me, question is, wish die?" "No," replied I; "I want live, answer questions, shall so." "I so," replied he. "I done wrong, I make amends. Do understand me? I mean say, I cruel you, I wish, answer every question may put me, well I can." "That I want," replied I. "I know is, wound festering must washed dressed. The feathers make worse. Will me?" I thought little, recollected he still power, he could obtain water. I replied, "Yes, I will." "The cord hurts it, must take off." I fetched kid water, untied cord, took away feathers, matted together flow blood, I washed wound carefully. Looking wound, desire information induced say, "What little white cords, cut through?" "They sinews tendons," replied he, "by enabled move hands fingers; cut through, I shall use hand again." "Stop moment," said I, rising up, "I thought something." I ran point chest lay, took shirt rock, brought back me, tearing strips, I bandaged wound. "Where get linen?" said Jackson. I told him. "And got knife there, too," said he, sigh. I replied affirmative. As soon I finished, he told he much easier, said, "I thank you." "What I thank you?" replied I. "It means I grateful done." "And grateful?" inquired I again. "You never said words before." "Alas, no," replied he; "it better I had. I mean I feel kindly towards you, bound wound, would anything I power. It means, I eyesight, I week ago, master, I was, I would kick beat you, kind you. Do understand me?" "Yes," replied I, "I think I do; tell I want know I shall believe you." "That I soon I well enough; I ill--you must wait day two, till fever left me." Satisfied Jackson's promise, I tended carefully, washed dressed his wound two following days. He said he felt much better, his language kind conciliatory, I hardly knew make it; certain, good effect upon me, gradually hatred ill-will I bore wore off, I found handling tenderly, anxious give pain necessary, yet without aware I prompted better feelings. It third morning he said,-- "I talk now; want know?" "I want know whole story came island, father mother were, said hated name?" "That," said Jackson, silence minutes, "will take time. I could soon tell last question,--why I hated name? But history father mixed mine, I cannot well tell one without other. I may well begin history, telling both." "Then tell me," replied I, "and tell true." "No; I tell exactly was," replied Jackson; "you may well know not.--Your father I born England, know country birth, also know language talk English." "I know it. Tell something England say more." I trouble reader Jackson's description England, many questions I put him. It night-fall he finished answering, I satisfied information imparted. I believe he glad hold his tongue, he complained tired, I dressed his wound wetted bandage cold water he went sleep. I hardly describe reader effect uninterrupted flow language upon me; I excited strange way, many nights could sleep hours. I may say here, I understand great proportion meaning words used Jackson; I gathered context, I could always interrupting him. It astonishing fast ideas breed ideas, word, meaning I understand first used, became repetition clear intelligible; I always put right construction it, I find answer used another time former interpretation it, I would ask obtain explanation. This however occur often. As first night, I positively almost drunk words, remained nearly whole arranging fixing new ideas I acquired. My feelings towards Jackson also changed--that is, I longer felt hatred ill-will him. These swallowed pleasure he afforded me, I looked upon treasure beyond price,--not many old feelings towards returned intervals, easily disposed of, still I would world lost I obtained possible knowledge; his wound look well I removed bandage, I much distressed he was. Indeed, every prospect ultimately friends, mutual dependence other. It useless his part, his present destitute condition, nourish feelings animosity one whose good offices he wholly dependant, part, one creating me, I may say, new worlds imagination thought dwell on. On following morning, Jackson narrated substance (as near I recollect) follows:-- "I intended sailor. I taught good school, I ten years old, I put house business clerk, I remained desk day long, copying ledgers day-books, fact, writing required me. This house connected South American trade." "Where South America?" said I. "You better let tell story," replied Jackson, "and I done, ask questions like, stop me, take week finish it; yesterday lost whole day." "That is true," replied I, "then I so." "There two clerks counting-house--the head clerk, whose name Manvers, father, counting-house months me. Our master, whose name Evelyn, particular father myself, scanning work daily, finding fault deserved it. This occasioned rivalry us, made us active, I received praise quite often he did. On Sunday, Mr Evelyn used ask father spend day. We went church forenoon dined him. He daughter little younger were. She mother. Both us, grew up, attentive her, anxious her good graces. I cannot say preferred first, I rather think anything I favourite, first two years acquainted her. I lively better companion father, inclined grave thoughtful. We four years counting-house, mother died--my father dead time I went it--and her death I found share her property amount L2500. But I yet twenty-one years age. I could receive another year. Mr Evelyn, till every reason satisfied conduct, used joke me, say soon I age, he would allow me, I chose it, put money business, thus obtain small share it--and intention, I looked forward bright prospects hope one day married mother, I doubt would case, I still conducted properly. But, I age, I made bad acquaintances, soon ran expenses I could afford--and worst was, I contracted habit sitting late night, drinking excess, I never since got over, proved ruin then, proved ruin life. This little fortune mine gave consequence, thinking highly myself. I particular attentions Miss Evelyn, graciously received her father; neither I reason complain treatment young lady. As father, he quite thrown back-ground. He property hope any, except he might hereafter secure his diligence good conduct; attention I received Mr Evelyn, also head clerk, idea I partner consequently would become his superior, made melancholy unhappy--for I believe he quite much love Miss Evelyn I myself; I must tell you, love her unbounded, she well deserved it. But happy prospects overthrown folly. As soon known I property left me, I surrounded many others requested introduced me, evenings passed I considered good company, proved reverse. By degrees I took gambling, time, lost money I could afford pay. This caused recourse Jew, advanced loans large interest repaid coming age. Trying win back money, I last found indebted Jew sum nearly L1000. The I became involved, reckless I became. Mr Evelyn perceived I kept late hours, looked haggard, I well might; indeed, position become awkward. Mr Evelyn knew well sum left me, I account deficiency, he proposed I put business? I ruined his opinion, he never, I convinced, would entrust happiness his daughter young man guilty irregularities. At time, love her nearly amounted adoration. Never miserable I last six months previous coming age, drown misery I plunged every excess, seldom, ever, went bed state intoxication. Scheme scheme I propose enable conceal fault, I could hit upon nothing. The time approached; I within days coming age, Mr Evelyn sent spoke seriously, saying, regard memory father, he intimate, he willing allow embark little capital business, he hoped good conduct application I might soon become useful partner. I stammered reply surprised him; he asked explicit. I stated I considered capital small much use business his, I preferred trying quick method doubling it; soon I done I would accept his offer gratitude. 'As please,' replied he coolly; 'but take care, risking all, lose all. Of course, master,' saying, he left me, apparently much displeased mortified. But circumstances occurred, exposed whole affair. When company evening companions, I stated intentions trying fortune East Indies, seriously, talking random. This came ears Jew I borrowed money; he thought I intended leave kingdom without taking bonds, immediately repaired Mr Evelyn's counting-house, communicate head clerk, ascertain report correct, stating also sums I indebted him. The head clerk informed Mr Evelyn, day upon I became twenty-one years age, he sent his private room, and, remonstrances, I replied haughtily, ended dismissed. The fact was, Mr Evelyn had, since his last interview me, made inquiries, finding I living riotous life, he determined upon leaving his service. As soon first burst indignation over, I felt I lost; attachment Miss Evelyn stronger ever, I bitterly deplored folly, time, usual, I recourse bottle, drowning cares intemperance. I tried hard obtain interview Miss Evelyn previous quitting house, Mr Evelyn would permit, days after, sent his daughter away, reside, time relation country. I embarked capital wine trade, and, could I restrained drinking, successful, short time might doubled property, I stated Mr Evelyn; now, I become irreclaimable drunkard, case, hope over. My affairs soon became deranged, and, request partner, wound up, I found capital L1500 reduced L1000. With this, I resolved try fortune shipping; I procured share brig, sailed her myself. After time, I sufficiently expert take command her, might succeeded, habit drinking confirmed. When Ceylon, I fell sick, left behind. The brig lost, I forgotten insure portion her, I ruined. I struggled long, vain--intemperance curse, bane, millstone neck, dragged down: I education, talents, energy, one time, capital, useless; thus I sink down, captain vessel mate, mate second mate, I last found drunken sailor mast. Such general history; to-morrow, I let know how, way, father I met again, occurred, present time." But I much bewildered confused he told me, allow proceed, he proposed. "No, no," replied I. "I recollect said, although I understand. You must first answer questions, meaning words I never heard before. I cannot understand money is, gaming is, great many things talked about, I recollect, repeat every word said. To-morrow, I recall over, shall tell I cannot make out; that, go again." "Very well," replied he, "I do not care long takes answer questions, I anxious tell father myself." Chapter VI I hardly describe reader effect conversations Jackson upon first. If prisoner removed dark cell, introduced garden full fruit flowers, he never idea existence, he could filled wonder, surprise, pleasure. All novelty excitement, but, time, great degree, comprehension. I neither language ideas meet it, yet, I did, certain degree, comprehend. I saw clearly, sometimes mist, others dark fog, I could discern little. Every day, however, increased knowledge language terms gave increased knowledge ideas. I gained context I means, I degrees enlightened, thirst information knowledge became every day insatiable. That much I considered I understood erroneous, certain, mine knowledge, yet, theory only. I could imagine myself, far explanation I received, object might be, and, made ideas matter, I content; knowledge, would however incline think, occasionally decide, idea I formed incorrect, I would alter it. Thus I flounder sea uncertainty, still exciting interest. If one educated, used his eyes civilised country, reads account people things hitherto unknown him, he can, description his general knowledge, form correct idea country contains. But he used his eyes--he seen objects, parallel difference pointed out. Now I advantage. I seen nothing sea, rocks, sea-birds, one companion. Here great difficulty, which, I may say, never surmounted, I visited mixed civilisation men. The difficulty, however, increased ardour. I naturally ingenious mind, I remarkable memory, every increase knowledge source delight. In fact, I something live for, I not; I verily believe, Jackson chance removed particular time, I soon become lunatic, sudden drying well supplied inordinate thirst knowledge. Some days passed I asked Jackson continue his narrative, lived great harmony. Whether he deceiving me, commanding his temper till he opportunity revenge, whether his forlorn helpless condition softened down, I could say, he appeared gradually forming attachment me; I however guard times. His wounded wrist healed up, his hand quite useless, tendons severed. I therefore less fear before. At request he would continue his history, Jackson related follows:-- "After sailing vessel vessel, generally dismissed voyage failing intemperance, I embarked board ship bound Chili, coast nearly year, proceed home cargo, anchored Valdivia, previous homeward voyage, articles ship port. We ready sea, heard captain, he agreed take two passengers, gentleman his wife, wished proceed England. The cabin cleared out, every preparation made receive board, evening boat sent shore luggage. I went boat, I thought likely gentleman would give boat's crew something drink; I wrong--he gave us four dollars, spent immediately one ventas, less intoxicated. It arranged luggage first carried board, that, return passengers, sail early morning. We pulled luggage, arrival board, I drunk, captain would allow return boat, I knew nothing passed I roused next morning assist getting ship weigh. We weigh two three hours, clearing land fast, gentleman passenger came neck; I coiling rope quarter-deck, he passed me, I looked him, I recognised immediately father. Years passed--from stripling he grown man, his face mistaken. There he was, apparently gentlemen property consideration; I, I? drunken sailor. All I hoped was, he would recognise me. Shortly afterwards he went again, returned escorting his wife deck. Again I took furtive curious glance, perceived she Miss Evelyn I loved, folly lost. This madness. As stood deck enjoying cool sea breeze, weather delightfully fine, captain came joined them. I confused discovery, I knew I about, I presume something awkwardly; captain said me--'Jackson, about, drunken hound? I suppose sober yet.' At mention name, father mother looked me, I lifted head reply captain, eyed earnestly, spoke low tone; interrogated captain. I could hear said, I certain talking me, suspected, recognised me. I ready sink deck, and, time, I felt hatred father enter heart, which, his life, I never could divest myself. It I supposed; father recognised me, following morning he came I leaning gunwale amidships, addressed me,--'Jackson,' said he, 'I sorry find situation. You must unfortunate become reduced. If confide history me, perhaps I may, arrive England, able assist you, really give great pleasure.' I cannot say I replied cordially. 'Mr Henniker,' said I, 'you fortunate appearances, therefore afford compassion so; but, sir, positions, I feel pity reality sort triumph, offer assistance insult. I content present position, events change interference. I earn bread honestly. You more. Times may change yet. It is long road turning it. I wish good morning.' So saying, I turned him, walked away forward, heart full bitterness anger. From hour he never spoke noticed again, captain severe upon me, I ascribed his severity unjustly father. We go round Cape Horn, gale S.E. came on, ended loss vessel. For several days strove it, last vessel, old, leaked much straining, obliged bear run it, several days, wind sea continuing without intermission. At last found among islands, compelled occasionally haul wind clear them. This made her leak more, last she became water logged, forced abandon her haste night, time take anything us; left three men board, below. By mercy Heaven ran boat opening below, spot could landed. I think I better stop now, I good deal tell yet." "Do then," replied I; "and I think it, I bring chest things it, shall tell are." I went returned clothes linen. There eight pair trousers, nine shirts, besides one I torn bandage his wounds with, two pair blue trousers, two jackets, four white duck frocks, shoes, stockings. Jackson felt one one his hands, told were, worn. "Why do not wear them?" inquired I. "If give leave, I will," replied he. "Let duck frock pair trousers." I handed articles him, went back rest I left rocks. When I returned, arms full, I found he put on, his clothes beside him. "I feel like Christian now," said he. "A Christian," said I, "what that?" "I tell by-and-bye. It I long, long while," replied he. "Now, brought time?" "Here," said I, "what this?" "This roll duck, make frocks trousers," replied he. "That bees'-wax." He explained tools, sailing-needles, fish-hooks, fishing-lines, sheets writing-paper, two pens, I brought me. "All valuable," said he, pause, "and would added much comfort, I blind." "There things yet," said I; "I go fetch them." This time I replaced remaining articles, brought chest. It heavy load carry rocks, I breath I arrived set cabin-floor. "Now, I whole them," said I. "Now, this?" "That spy-glass--but, alas! I blind--but I show use it, events." "Here two books," said I. "Give me," said he, "and let feel them. This one Bible, I quite sure shape, is, I think, Prayer-book." "What Bible, Prayer-book?" replied I. "The Bible Word God, Prayer-book teaches us pray him." "But God? I often heard say, 'O God!' 'God damn'--but he?" "I tell to-night go sleep," replied Jackson, gravely. "Very well, I shall remind you. I found little box inside chest, full manner little things--strings sinews." "Let feel them?" I put bundle his hand. "These needles thread making mending clothes--they useful bye-and-bye." At last whole contents chest overhauled explained: I could well comprehend glass bottles, made, I put pannikins, everything else, carefully chest again, hauled chest farther end cabin, way. Before went bed night, Jackson explain God was, commencement several conversations subject, I shall present trouble reader passed us. Jackson appeared melancholy conversation religious matters, frequently agitated muttering himself. Chapter VII I following day ask resume his narrative relative father mother, I perceived he avoided it, I already far changed consideration his feelings. Another point taken possession mind, was, whether possible learn read books I found chest, first question I put Jackson arose morning. "How possible?" replied he. "Am I blind--how I teach you?" "Is way?" replied I, mournfully. "Let think.--Yes, perhaps way--at events try. You know book I told Prayer-book?" "Oh yes! small, thin one." "Yes--fetch here. Now," said he, I put his hand, "tell me; straight line middle page book, words letters sides it?" "Yes, is," replied I; "in every page, call it, black line middle, words letters (I suppose are) sides." "And among letters, larger others, especially side nearest margin." "I do not know margin is." "I mean here," replied he, pointing margin page. "Yes, are." "Well then, I open book near I guess Morning service, tell find part writing appears begin large round letter, like--what shall I say?--the bottom pannikin." "There one leaf, quite round." "Very well--now get small piece stick, make point it." I so, Jackson swept away small place floor cabin. "Now," said he, "there many prayers begin round O, letter called; I must first ascertain one one I require. If is, I know heart, shall able teach letters alphabet." "What is alphabet?" "The alphabet number letters invented enable us read write. There twenty-six them. Now look, Frank; next letter O shape this?" he drew pointed stick letter YOU ground. "Yes, is," replied I. "And next like this," continued he, drawing letter R, he smoothed ground effaced YOU. "Yes," replied I. "Well then, make sure, I better go on. OUR one word, little space between; next come F." "Yes," replied I, looking he drawn comparing letter book. "Then I believe right, make sure, go little longer." Jackson completed word "Father," "which art," followed it, he satisfied. "Now," said he, "out prayer I teach letters, pay attention, learn read." The whole morning passed telling different letters, I soon knew all. During day, Lord's Prayer gone through, I learnt words well letters, I could repeat night; I read twenty thirty times, spelling every word, letter letter, I perfect. This first lesson. "Why called Lord's Prayer?" said I. "Because, Lord Jesus Christ asked His followers way ought address God, He gave prayer repeat, proper could use." "But Jesus Christ?" "He Son God, I told yesterday, time equal God." "How could he equal God, if, said yesterday, God sent killed?" "It his consent he suffered death; mystery cannot understand present." "What is mystery?" "That cannot understand." "Do understand yourself?" "No, I not; I know fact, mine, men's comprehension. But I tell honestly that, points, I bad teacher; I paid little attention life, far religion concerned, I give outlines, I know more." "But I thought said, people punished rewarded died, according lived bad good life; live good life, people must religious, obey God's commands." "I tell so, I told truth; I tell I led bad life, I done, I neglected pay obedience God's word command." "Then punished die, not?" "Alas! I fear so, child," replied Jackson, putting his hands his forehead hiding his face. "But still time," continued he, pause, "O God mercy!" exclaimed he, "how shall I escape?" I continue conversation, Jackson requested I would leave alone time. I went sat rock, watching stars. "And those, he says, made God,"--"and God made everything," thought I, "and God lives beyond stars." I thought long while, much perplexed. I never heard anything God till night before, Jackson told enough make anxious curious; he evidently like talk subject. I tried time, I could repeat Lord's Prayer, I found I could, I knelt rock, looking bright star, I would imagine God, I repeated Lord's Prayer it, I rose went bed. This first time I ever prayed. I learnt much Jackson, latterly, I could hardly retain I learnt; events, I confused recollection brain, thoughts turned one subject another, till was, time, perfect chaos; degrees things unravelled themselves, ideas became clear; still I laboured half-comprehension things, which, position, unavoidable. But mind occupied one leading object wish, learn read. I thought Jackson's history account he might give father mother, willing he deferred time. What I required able read books, object whole mind attention given. Three four hours earlier portion day, time latter, dedicated pursuit, attention never tired flagged. In course of, I think, six weeks, I could read, without hesitation, almost portion Bible Prayer-Book. I required teaching Jackson, became attentive hearer, I read every morning evening portion Gospel Liturgy. But I cannot say I understood many portions I read, questions I put Jackson puzzled little, often he acknowledged he could answer them. As I afterwards discovered arose his imperfect knowledge nature Christian religion, which, according his statement me, might considered comprised following sentence: "If good earth, go heaven happy; ill, go hell tormented. Christ came heaven teach us do, follow his example; read Bible must believe." This may considered creed imparted time. I believe Jackson, like many others, knew better, candidly told he taught believe. But season return birds arrived, stock provender getting low. I therefore soon obliged leave books, work hard Jackson myself. As soon young birds old enough, I set task. And I found valuable knives I obtained seaman's chest; indeed, many points I could work much faster. By tying neck sleeves duck frock, I made bag, enabled carry birds conveniently, greater quantities time, knives I could skin prepare bird one quarter time. With fishing-lines also, I could hang dry one time, that, though without assistance, I birds cured time Jackson I employed labour. The whole affair, however, occupied morning evening three weeks, time major portion provender piled back cabin. I not, however, lose I gained reading, Jackson would let go away morning, retire bed evening, without reading portion Bible. Indeed, he appeared uncomfortable I so. At last, work ended, I felt strong desire return hear portion Jackson's history connected father mother, I told so. He appear pleased communication, willing proceed, I pressed hard showed symptoms resolution rebellion, he reluctantly resumed his narrative. Chapter VIII "I wish understand," said he, "that unwillingness go history, proceeds obliged make known hatred subsisted father me; recollect, had, early days, striving gain object--I mean mother--and also he taken, were, I considered place, points--that he successful life, I unfortunate, must surprised hating I did." "I understand nothing feelings," replied I; "and he injured marrying mother, I cannot see." "Why I loved her." "Well, suppose did, I do not know love is, therefore cannot understand it, tell story." "Well then, I left off, I told ventured land upon island running boat bathing-pond, doing, boat beaten pieces, use afterwards. We landed, eight persons all--that is, captain, father, carpenter, mate, three seamen, besides mother. We literally nothing boat except three axes, two kids, two pannikins, indeed now, provisions even water none either. Our first object, therefore, search island obtain water, soon found rill runs side cabin. It fortunate us arrived exactly time birds come island, laid eggs; not, must perished hunger, fish-hook us even fathom line. "We collected quantity eggs, made good meal, although devoured raw. While running about, rather climbing about, rocks, find chance subsistence might island, captain father remained mother, sat sheltered spot near bathing-pool. On return evening, captain called us together he might speak us, he said would well must act concert; also would necessary one command control others; without case, nothing would go well;--and he asked us consider he said true. We agreed, although I, one, felt little inclination so, rest said so, I raised objections. The captain told us one opinion, next point, decide command--he said, ship-board, he course would taken himself, shore he thought Mr Henniker much competent person he was, he therefore proposed command given him, he, one, would willingly his orders. To proposal, carpenter mate immediately agreed, last two seamen. I left alone, I resisted, saying, I going ordered landsman, I obey orders, must thorough-bred seaman. The two sailors way thinking, I sure, although given consent, I hoped would join me, appeared much inclined do. Your father spoke coolly, modestly, prudently. He pointed he wish take command, he would cheerfully serve captain vessel, would satisfactory parties case. But captain others positive, saying would choice disputed drunken vagabond I was, I like remain them, I might go part island I chose. This conference ended getting passion, saying I would father's orders; I seizing one axes go it, captain caught arm wrested me, stating axe his property, telling I welcome go I pleased. "I left them, therefore, went away birds hatching, I wished secure supply eggs. When night closed in, I lay upon guano, felt cold, gale over, weather mild. "The next morning, I awoke, I found sun time. I looked rest companions I quitted, perceived busily work. The sea quite calm; and, vessel went left, many articles floated, washed island. Some men busy collecting spars planks, near rocks, pushing along boat-hooks direction bathing pond, hauled ridge, secured them. Your father mother, carpenter, ledge are, selected proper place building shelter, apparently busy. The captain one seamen carrying spars timber could collected father standing carpenter. All appeared active, working others hands; I confess that, I looked on, I envied them, wished I along them; I could bear idea obeying orders given father; alone prevented joining them, making excuses I done said previous night. I therefore swallowed birds' eggs raw, sat sun, looking worked. "I soon perceived carpenter commenced operations. The frame cabin was, assistance father, noon, quite complete put up; went bathing place, boat lying her bottom beaten out. They commenced taking her pieces saving nails; men carried portions boat ripped off, frame cabin raised. I saw mother go load her hand, I believed nails taken boat. In couple hours boat pieces carried up, father men went assist carpenter. I hardly need tell did, cabin you. The roof, see, mostly built timbers boat; lower part heavier wood; good job made it. Before morning closed in, one sides cabin finished; I saw light fire chips cut axes, dressed eggs birds collected first day. "There one thing I quite forgotten I mutinied left companions, was, necessity water drink; I perceived taken possession spot water yet found. I suffering much thirst towards close day, I set ravine ascertain none found direction. Before night I succeeded finding some, know, often drunk spring gone firewood. This gave great encouragement, I afraid want water would driven submission. By way bravado, I tore off, cut knife, many boughs underwood ravine I well could carry, next morning I built sort wigwam guano, show I house head well had; I built farther edge cliff, guano plain, I need communication I knew would come eggs birds daily sustenance. "Before night following day set in, cabin quite finished. "The weather became warmer every day, I found fatiguing climb ravine two three times day procure drink water, I nothing hold water in, I thought would better I take quarters ravine, build wigwam among brushwood close water, instead make many journeys necessary article. I knew I could carry eggs hat pocket-handkerchief sufficient two three days one trip; I determined I would so; next morning I went ravine, loaded eggs, take residence there. In day two I built hut boughs, made comfortable. I returned fresh supply eggs third day, basket I constructed young boughs, enabled carry whole week's sustenance. Then I felt quite satisfied, made mind I would live hermit sojourn island, however long might be; I preferred anything obeying orders one I detested I father. "It soon evident, however, well done selecting father leader. They fancied birds would remain island, thus would always able procure supply. Your father, lived long Chili, knew better, weeks would quit nesting place. He pointed them, showing mercy cast away time, necessary make provision year. But could imagine possible without salt cure birds with; he knew beef preserved without salt continent, showed dry birds sun. While therefore I ravine, busy collecting drying large quantities, time birds leaving laid sufficient supply. It he also invented fishing lines sinews legs birds, mother knotted together. At first, caught fish hooks made nails, father showed way take without hook, learnt me, he shown Indians continent. Owing father, well prepared birds flew away young ones, I destitute. Previous flight, I fared badly, eggs contained young birds half formed, latterly completely formed I could eat them, I fire understand drying them, I alternative eating young birds raw, anything pleasant. I consoled myself, however, idea father mother rest faring badly myself, I looked forward time birds would begin lay eggs again, I resolved hoard much larger supply fresh. But schemes put end to, two days, great deal noise flying circles, birds, young old, took wing, left without means future subsistence. "This horrid discovery, I put wits' ends. I wandered guano place, and, third day departure, glad pick even dead bird appease hunger. At time, I wondered former companions got on, I considered must badly I was. I watched behind rocks, I could perceive signs uneasiness. There mother sitting quietly level cabin, father captain talking her. I perceived, however, two party employed fishing rocks, I wondered got fishing-lines, last I concluded catching fish supported themselves. This, however, help me--I starving, starvation bring pride man. On fifth day, I walked rocks, one seamen fishing, greeted him, I told I starving, asked something eat. "'I cannot help you,' replied he; 'I power give anything away; I dare do. You must apply Mr Henniker, governor now. What foolish fellow mutiny, did; see brought to.' "'Why,' replied I, 'if fishing, would better I am.' "'Oh yes be; thank that--without him, I grant, been. We plenty provisions, although fish help out.' "This puzzled amazingly, help it. I could starve longer, I went level father standing captain, swaggering sort tone, said I come back, wanted join comrades. The captain looked me, referred father, said he would consult rest came dinner, without permission he could nothing, turned away. In meantime I ravenous hunger, made perceiving two large fish slowly baking embers fire, mother watching them; however, help it, I sat little distance, anxiously waiting return rest party, fate would decided. My pride brought low I could submitted terms might dictated. In two hours assembled dinner, I remained envying every morsel ate, repast finished; consultation, I ordered approach--which I did--and father addressed me: 'Jackson, deserted us might useful, labour severe; worked hard, made tolerably comfortable, request join us, partake us fruits labour foresight. You provided nothing, have--the consequence comparative plenty, starving. Now I taken opinion companions, agreed, assisted wanted, allow join us, work others make equivalent. It therefore proposed shall join us one condition, is, year till birds visit island, task go ravine every day, procure firewood required. If choose accept terms, permitted join, always supposing rules regulations laid guidance, subject well are. These terms, may decide think proper.' I hardly need say, I gladly accepted them, still glad remnants dinner placed me; I nearly choked, I devoured haste appetite appeased. "When done, I thought conditions I accepted, blood boiled idea I manner slave rest, I work hard every day. I forgot justice, I earning share years' provisions, I assisted collect. My heart still bitter father, I vowed vengeance ever I opportunity, help it. Every day I went piece cord axe, cut large faggot wood, brought cabin. It hard work, occupied breakfast dinner-time, I time lose I wanted back dinner. The captain always examined faggot, ascertained I brought sufficient supply day's consumption." Chapter IX "A year passed away, I thus employed. At last, birds made appearance, laid annual provision, I freed task, share labour others. It great source speculation long likely remain island; every day anxiously look vessel, could see none, seen, far island permit us make signals them. At last began give hope, and, hope abandoned, settled gloom perceptible faces. I believe others would mutinied well myself, known mutiny about. Your father mother life soul party, inventing amusements, narrating touching story evenings, beguile weary time; great respect paid mother, she certainly deserved; I seldom approached her; she taken decided dislike me, arising, I presume, behaviour towards her husband, I footing others, I insolent I dared be, without incurring penalty attached insubordination, I opposed much I could every proposal he brought forward--but father kept his temper, although I lost mine often. The first incident occurred consequence, loss two men, had, father's permission, taken week's provisions, intention making tour round island, ascertaining whether valuable information could brought back; carpenter one seamen. It appears return, crossing highest ridge, they, feeling thirsty, finding water, attempted refresh eating berries found plant. These berries proved strong poison, returned ill--after languishing days, died. "This event roused us up, broke monotony life; one agreeable dwell upon, yet, time, I felt rather pleasure annoyance it--I felt I consequence, many thoughts entered mind I shall dwell upon. We buried guano, first high rock, where, indeed, others subsequently buried. Three months passed away, seaman missing. After search, his trousers found edge rock. He evidently bathing sea, day he missed, water smooth glass. Whether he seen something floating, he wished bring land, whether he ventured his amusement, he excellent swimmer, could never ascertained--any whether he sunk cramp, taken shark. He never appeared again, his real fate mystery day, must ever remain so. Thus reduced four men--your father, captain, mate, me. But must tired--I stop now, tell remainder time." Although I tired, yet, Jackson appeared so, I made objection his proposal, went sleep. While I read Bible Jackson, I often puzzled numbers mentioned, never could understand meant, is, I could form quantity represented seventy sixty, whatever might be. Jackson's answer was, "Oh! means great many; I will explain bye-and-bye, nothing count with, I blind, I must something hand teach you." I recollected bathing pool great many small shells rocks, size pea; live fish them, appeared crawl rocks. I collected great quantity these, brought cabin, requested Jackson would teach count. This he did, he came thousand, he said sufficient. For many days I continued count hundred, I quite perfect, Jackson taught addition subtraction certain degree, making add take away shells, count accumulation, remainder. At last, I could remember I gained manipulation, I may use term, further, I could go, although addition had, degree, made master multiplication, subtraction gave good idea division. This new delight me, occupied three four weeks. At last I had, I thought, learned he could teach his blind state, I threw away shells, sighed something more. Of sudden occurred me, I never looked book still lay upon shelf cabin, I saw reason I not; I mentioned Jackson, asked I might book? "To sure may," replied he; "but never asked it, I quite forgot it." "But I asked before, particular I open it. What reason then?" Jackson replied--"I reason except I disliked you, I thought looking book would give pleasure. It belonged poor fellow drowned; he left stern-sheets boat Valdivia, forgotten it, found landed island. Take down, amuse you." I took book, opened it. It was, I recollect right, called "Mavor's Natural History." At events, Natural History Beasts Birds, plate representing each, description annexed. It would impossible convey reader astonishment delight. I never seen picture drawing life. I know things existed. I ecstasy delight I turned pages, hardly taking sufficient time see one object I hastened another. For two three hours I thus turn leaves, without settling upon one animal; last pulse beat regularly, I commenced Lion. But source amusement, multitude questions answered companion. He tell countries animals found; description animals, anecdotes, source much conversation; and, more, foregrounds backgrounds landscapes animals surrounded produced new ideas. There palm-tree, I explained Jackson, inquired it. This led inquiries. The lion occupied whole afternoon, getting dark I lay down, new treasure side. I read lion Scriptures, I recalled passages; I slept I thought bear destroyed children mocked Elisha prophet, I determined first animal I would read next morning bear. I think book lasted nearly two months, time, except reading portion every night morning Jackson, Bible Prayer-book neglected. Sometimes I thought book could true; I came birds, I found frequented island correctly described, I longer doubt subject. Perhaps interested plates barn-door fowls peacock described, background first cottage figures, representing rural scenery England, country; second splendid mansion, carriage four horses driving door. In short, impossible convey reader new ideas I received slight efforts draftsman give effect his drawing. The engraving also matter much wonder, required great deal explanation Jackson. This book became treasure, till I read through, almost know heart, length I returned Bible. All time I never asked Jackson go his narrative; curiosity appeased, I made request. He appeared, before, unwilling; I pertinacious, he worried it. "There four us left mother, mate bad state health; he fretted much, poor fellow, he left young wife England, he appeared fear was, she would married he could get home. It ended confirmed liver complaint, carried nine months afterwards; thus one companions disposed of. He died quietly, gave his sleeve-buttons watch deliver his wife, ever I escape island. I fear little chance her ever receiving them." "Where they?" said I, recollecting I seen lift board his bed-place. "I safe," replied Jackson, "and necessary, tell find them." This reply satisfied me, I allowed proceed. "We buried guano, side two others, three. It time mother confined born; three months death mate. We finished laying stock birds year she taken ill, sooner expected, supposed occasioned over-exertion time. However, she got well without medical assistance, father much pleased son, he married five years without prospect family. I ought observe loss companions, one another, effect bringing remained much closer together; I treated kindness father mother, captain, I returned well feelings would permit me, I could altogether get rid animosity father. However, became much confidential, certain, I treated equal. "Six months passed away become thriving child, melancholy occurrence"--here Jackson covered his face his hands remained time silent. "Go on," said I, "Jackson, I know died somehow another." "Very true," replied he, recovering himself. "Well, father disappeared. He gone rocks fish, I sent bring home dinner, he nowhere found. It supposed larger fish usual fast his line, he jerked rocks water sharks taken him. It dreadful affair," continued Jackson, covering his face. "I think," replied I, "that man his senses would allowed fish taken line rather dragged water. I do not think supposed manner his death satisfactory." "Perhaps not," replied Jackson; "his foot may slipped, knows? could guess; line gone well he, made us think I said. Still searched everywhere, without hope; search--that captain's mine, poor mother remained her arms distracted--was another disaster--no less death captain. They say misfortunes never come single, surely instance truth proverb." "How he die?" replied I, gravely, somehow I felt doubts truth he saying. Jackson reply till pause, he said-- "He ravine collecting firewood, he fell high cliff. He injured he died half hour." "What do?" "What I do--what could I go back break news mother, distracted she heard it; captain her friend, she could bear me." "Well go on, pray," said I. "I I could make mother comfortable, her, you, I, left island. You three years old; mother always hated me, appeared hate more. She never recovered loss father she devotedly attached; she pined away, six months she died, leaving island. Now know whole history, pray ask it." Chapter X Jackson threw back his bed-place silent. So I, I recalling he told me, doubts raised truth it. I like his hurrying latter portion his narrative way he done. What he said mother satisfactory. I time gradually drawing towards him, shewing, feeling, great increase goodwill; suspicion entered mind, I began feel former animosity towards renewed. A night's sleep, however, reflection, induced think possibly I judging harshly, I could afford quarrel him, intercourse remained amicable before, particularly he became amiable towards everything his power interest amuse me. I one day reading account monkey given book Natural History, said animal fond spirits intoxicate itself, Jackson telling many anecdotes monkeys board vessel he sailed in, occurred I never thought mentioning ascertaining contents cask thrown bathing-pool seaman's chest, I Jackson, wondering contents got at. Jackson entered question warmly, explaining bore holes gimlet, making two spiles stop holes with. As soon he done so, curiosity induced go pool cask lying long, foot-and-half water. By Jackson's directions I took pannikin me, I might bring specimen contents cask, prove water. I soon bored hole below, following Jackson's directions, liquor, poured small stream pannikin, brown colour strong odour, strong, indeed, make reel I walked back rocks pannikin full it. I sat down, time tasted it. I thought I swallowed fire, I taken good mouthful it. "This cannot Jackson called spirits," said I. "No one drink this--what be?" Although I swallowed table-spoonful it, yet, combined fumes liquor I inhaled drawing pannikin, effect make head swim, I lay rock shut eyes recover myself. It ended falling asleep many hours, much noon I went cask, near sunset I awoke, intense pain head. It time I could recollect I was, passed, pannikin full liquor side first reminded me; perceiving late was, long I must slept, I rose up, taking pannikin hand, I hastened return cabin. As I approached, I heard voice Jackson, whose hearing, since his blindness, I observed, become peculiarly acute. "Is you, Frank?" "Yes," replied I. "And kept long--how frightened me. God forgive me, I thought I left abandoned starvation." "Why thought that?" replied I. "Because I thought way another must killed, I must died, course. I never frightened life, idea dying alone--it terrible." It occurred time alarm himself, he say word sorry he accident happening me, I made remark, simply stating occurred, conviction contents cask drinkable. "Have brought you?" inquired he, sharply. "Yes, is," said I, giving pannikin. He smelt it, raised his lips--took wine-glassful it, drew his breath. "This delightful," said he; "the best old rum, I never tasted good. How big say cask was?" I described well I could. "Indeed, must whole puncheon--that last long while." "But mean say really like drink stuff?" inquired I. "Do I like drink it? yes, good men, it is death little boys. It kill you. Do not get fond it. Now promise never drink drop it. You must get fond it, sad accident happen you." "I do not think need fear drinking it," replied I. "I one taste, I told you, nearly burnt mouth. I shall not touch again." "That is right," replied Jackson, taking another quantity his mouth. "You old enough it; bye-and-bye, old I am, may drink it, good. Now, I will go bed, it is time bed. Bring pannikin put side. Take care do not spill it." Jackson crawled his bed, I followed pannikin, put his side, he requested, I returned resting-place, without however least inclination sleep, slept long day. At first Jackson quiet, I heard occasionally applying pannikin, held, I say, three half-pints liquor. At last he commenced singing sea song; I much surprised, I never heard sing before; I also much pleased, first time I ever heard anything like melody, he good voice sang good tune. As soon he finished, I begged go on. "Ah!" replied he, gay tone I never heard before. "You like songs, you? little chap. Well, I will give plenty them. It Is long since I sung, it is 'poor heart never rejoiceth.' The time one company could sing song I could, I again, I something cheer heart. Yes, here is another you. I shall rouse by-and-bye, I get grog in--no fear that--you find stuff, I will find songs." I surprised first unusual mirth; recollecting Jackson told his intemperance, I presumed mirth produced he indulged much it; I felt less inclined blame him. At events, I much pleased songs he sang one another three four hours, his voice became thick, and, muttering swearing, he quite silent, soon afterwards snored loudly. I remained awake time longer, I also sank forgetfulness. When I awoke next morning, I found Jackson still fast asleep. I waited morning meal; but, he wake, I took mine myself, I walked rock, I usually sat, looked round horizon see anything sight. The spy-glass, sea water, use, I know it; could Jackson instruct me. After I hour I returned, found Jackson still snoring, I determined wake up. I pushed time without success; but, last he opened his eyes, said: "My watch already?" "No," said I; "but slept long, I waked up." He paused, he know voice, said: "But I cannot see anything; how is this?" "Why, do not know you are blind, Jackson?" replied I, amazement. "Yes, yes; I recollect now. Is anything pannikin?" "Not drop," replied I; "why, must drunk all." "Yes, I recollect now. Get water, good boy; I dying thirst." I went water; he drank whole pannikin, asked more. "Will not something eat?" said I. "Eat? oh no; I cannot eat anything. Give drink;" he held his hand pannikin. I perceived trembled shook, I observed him. "Yes," replied he, "that is always case carouse, I good one last night--the first many year. But there is plenty it. I wish would get little now, Frank, steady me; two three mouthfuls, more; is, till night-time. Did I make much noise last night?" "You sang several songs," replied I, "with I much amused." "I am glad liked them. I used considered good singer day; indeed, I good company, term it, I become fond drinking. Just go fetch half inch high pannikin, good fellow, that is I want now." I went cask, drew quantity he requested, brought him. He drank off; and, moments, appeared quite again. He asked something eat, commenced telling variety stories relative he termed jolly parties his former days; day passed agreeably. As night closed in, he said: "Now, Frank, I know want hear songs; go bring full pannikin, I sing plenty." I complied his request, I anxious amused I night before. The consequence night was, early portion it, repetition previous one. Jackson took precaution get his bed-place he commenced drinking; and, soon he taken his second dose, he asked sort songs I liked. My reply naturally was, I never heard one sing him, therefore could say. "What I sing last night?" said he. I replied well I could. "Ah," said he, "they sea songs; I give something better." After little thought, he commenced singing beautiful plaintive one, certainly much better he sung night before; he sober. The consequence was, I still delighted; and, request, he sang several others; last his speech became rapid thick, he would sing more, using coarse expressions I asked him. For time he silent, I thought he going sleep, I reflecting upon various effects liquor appeared upon him, I heard talking muttering, I listened. "Never mind I got them," said he; "quite honestly people, Old Moshes. There are, choose buy them?" Then pause, he commenced: "They are pure diamonds ever came mine. I know that, none lies, old Jew. Where I come them? that is concern yours. The question is, give price, not? Well, then, I am off. No, I will not come back, old thief." Here he swore terribly, silent. After he recommenced-- "Who ever prove Henniker's diamonds?" I started mention father's name; I rested hands floor cabin, breathless would come next. "No, no," continued Jackson, "he is dead, food fishes--dead men tell tales--and she is dead, captain's dead, dead--yes, all;" he gave bitter groan silent. The day breaking, I could see he lay; he said more, appeared breathe heavily. As sun rose, I got bed-place; and, broad daylight, I looked Jackson. He lying his back; his brow covered large drops perspiration, his hands clenched together. Although asleep, he appeared, convulsive twitching muscles his face, suffering great agony. Occasionally he groaned deeply, his lips appeared move, sound proceeded them. I perceived pannikin liquor finished, one-third least left. Chapter XI I went cabin took usual seat, began reflect upon I heard. He talked diamonds; I knew diamonds were, far great value, I read Bible, Jackson explained value precious stones me, told diamonds great value indeed. Then he said Henniker's diamonds--he must meant father, positive. And one could prove his--this implied Jackson right them; indeed could he have? And I recalled mind his secret hiding place his bed, I presumed diamonds deposited. I turned mind he told relative death father, captain, mother, confused he was, glad he get rid subject, unsatisfactory I thought his account time. After much cogitation, I made mind Jackson told truth, mystery yet explained; I get it? There one way. The liquor made talk. I would supply liquor, degrees I would get truth him. At time I would allow suppose he said anything commit himself, I suspicions. How naturally fall treachery deceit, evil hearts, without assistance example world. How could I learnt deceit? Isolated I been, must innate? I returned cabin, woke Jackson without much difficulty, since he drunk much previous night. "How morning?" said I. "Not well; I bad dreams." "Well sang beautiful songs," replied I. "Yes, I recollect," said he; "but I fell asleep last." "Yes, refused sing more, went loud snore." Jackson got his bed-place, I gave his meal. We talked whole day singing, I hummed air pleased most. "You got air pretty correct," said he; "you must ear music. Have ever tried sing?" "No, never; know I not." "You might tried I you. Try now. I sing tune, repeat me." He so, I repeated it. "Very good," said he. "Let us try compass voice." He ran gamut, I followed him. "I think go higher I can," said he, "however go quite high enough, I will give singing lesson." Thus occupied intervals whole day, Jackson would allow try voice much first. As evening fell, he asked fetch liquor, I three quart wine bottles, I mentioned, I found chest, I took fill, would save many trips, convenient every respect. I brought full, Jackson stopped rags I torn bind round his wrist, put three his bed-place. "That much better arrangement," said he, "as I pour liquor pannikin I want it; besides, I mean take little water future. It is quite good water, lasts longer, one do not go sleep soon. Well, I little thought I comfort sent sufferings. I do not much care staying here. Go fetch water pannikin." That night repetition first. Jackson sang till he intoxicated, fell fast asleep, talking saying word, I disappointed, I remained awake catch anything he might say. It would tedious repeat took place month;--suffice say rarely, time, Jackson said anything his sleep, drunken state, he say I could make nothing of. He continued, daytime, give lessons singing, I could sing several songs correctly. At night, he returned his usual habit, less intoxicated night over. I perceived, however, excess great effect upon his constitution, he become pale haggard. Impatient I felt find truth, I concealed feelings towards (which certainly much changed since discovery I made suspicions I formed) I remained best terms him, resolving wait patiently. He spoken once, therefore I argued he would speak again, I wrong calculations. One night, he finished his usual allowance liquor, composed sleep, I observed he unusually restless, changing his position his bed-place every minutes, and, last, he muttered, "Captain James. Well, Captain James, eh?" A thought struck he might reply question. "How he die?" said I, low clear voice. "Die?" replied Jackson, "he fell cliff. Yes, he did. You cannot say I killed him. No--never put finger him." After that, he silent time, he recommenced. "She always said I destroyed both, I not--only one--yes, one, I grant--but I hated him--no, his diamonds--no, no--if said his wife indeed--love hate." "Then killed love his wife, hate himself?" "Yes, I did. Who guessed that? Who you? I will life." As he said this, he started his bed-place, awakened his dream, probably voice, he replied to. "Who spoke?" said he. "Frank Henniker, speak?" I made reply, pretended sound asleep, he still sat up, watching me. I feigned snore. "It could him," muttered Jackson, "he is quite fast. Mercy, dream!" He sank his bed-place, I heard gurgling noise told he put bottle liquor his mouth, drinking it. From time gurgling lasted, he must taken great deal. At last, quiet again. "So I discovered last," said I, blood boiled I heard. "He murder father. Shall I kill he sleeps?" first thought came troubled mind. "No, I will not that. What then, shall I tax he awake, kill him?" I thought, that, he blind, unable defend himself, would cowardly, I could that. What I do? I cooled down, I thought words Bible, return good evil; Jackson, whom, I read it, I asked told so, explained me, afterwards I came part said, "Vengeance mine, saith Lord," he told punishment wicked hereafter, reason obey Jewish law "an eye eye, tooth tooth," I referred to. This portion Bible he well explained, certain prevented raising hand night. Still, I remained state great excitement; I felt would impossible longer good terms him, I revolved question mind, till last, worn excitement, I fell fast asleep. A short time daylight, I started I thought faint cry, I listened, hearing nothing more, I fell asleep, broad daylight I arose; first thoughts naturally Jackson, I looked he lay, he longer there--his bed-place empty. I astonished, moment's thought, I recollected cry I heard night, I ran cabin looked around me, I could see nothing him. I went edge flat rock upon cabin built looked it; thirty feet rock one below, nearly perpendicular. I thought he must gone night, intoxicated liquor, fallen precipice; I see I peered over. "He must gone water," thought I, I ran corner rock, precipice much deeper, looking over, I perceived lying without motion apparent life. I had, then, judged rightly. I sat side pool water quite overpowered; last night I planning I destroy him, he lay dead without guilty crime. "Vengeance mine, saith Lord," words first escaped lips; I remained many minutes deep thought. At last occurred he might yet dead; I ran cliff, and, clambering rocks, arrived breathless spot Jackson lay. He groaned heavily I stood him. "Jackson," said I, kneeling him, "are much hurt?" feelings animosity vanished I perceived his unhappy condition. His lips moved, he utter sound. At last he said, low voice, "Water." I hastened back fast I could cabin, got pannikin half full water, poured little rum bottle. This journey return occupied ten minutes. I put his lips, he seemed revive. He dreadful object look at. The blood cut his head poured his face beard, clotted gore. How remove cabin I knew not. It would hardly possible carry broken rocks I climbed arrive he lay; way longer, difficult. By degrees he appeared recover; I gave contents pannikin, last he could speak, although great pain difficulty. As he he put his hand his side. He indeed ghastly object, his sightless eyeballs, his livid lips, his face beard matted blood. "Do think could get cabin, I helped you?" said I. "I shall never get there--let die I am," said he. "But cut head deep," replied I. "No, I do not feel it;--but--my side--I bleed inwardly--I am--broken pieces," said he, pausing gasping word. I looked his side, perceived already black much swollen. I offered drink, he took eagerly, I returned supply. I filled two wine-bottles water small drop spirits before, went back he lay. I found recovered, I hopes he might still well, I told so. "No, no," replied he; "I hours live--I feel that. Let die here, die peace." He sank sort stupor, occasioned, I presume, I given drink, remained quite quiet, breathing heavily. I sat waiting till he rouse again; hour I confused state mind, may well imagined, passed night. Chapter XII What I thought obtaining him, he dying, full truth deaths father mother. Jackson remained long state stupor, I feared he would die I could interrogate him; this, proved, case. I waited another hour, impatiently I must acknowledge, I went asked he felt. He replied immediately, without difficulty he appeared experienced. "I better now--the inward bleeding stopped; still I cannot live--my side broken in, I think rib fractured pieces, spine injured, I cannot move feel legs; I may live many hours yet, I thank God His mercy allowing much time--short indeed make reparation bad life, still nothing impossible God." "Well, then," replied I, "if speak, I wish would tell truth relative father's death, also death others; father I know murdered him--for said last night sleep." After pause, Jackson replied--"I glad I did, told so--I wished make full confession even you, confession proof repentance. I know must hate me, hate memory, I cannot surprised it; look now, Frank, ask heart whether I object pity hatred. 'Vengeance mine, saith Lord!' His vengeance fallen upon even world? Look me; I am, separated world I loved much, chance ever joining it--possessed wealth would months ago made happy--now blind, crushed pieces avenging God, whose presence I must shortly appear answer wickedness--all expectations overthrown, hopes destroyed, accumulated sins procuring nothing, but, may be, eternal condemnation. I ask again, I object pity commiseration?" I could assent this, he proceeded. "I tell truth. I tell truth time father mother's embarkation board brig, gale wind came occasioned eventually loss ship. Now give little drink. "The vessel tossed storm, waves broke her continually, between-decks full water, hatches kept down, heat oppressive. When watch I remained below, looked another berth sleep in. Before cabin bulkheads starboard side, captain fitted sort sail-room contain spare sails case require them. It eight feet square, sails piled it, reach within two feet deck overhead; though lower ones wetted water, dry, I took berth top sails sleeping place. Now state-room father mother slept side cabin bulkhead, straining rolling vessel opened chinks planks, I could see great deal done state-room, could hear every word almost spoken them. I aware I selected place berth, I found first night, light candle shining chinks darkness I surrounded outside. Of course, man alone his wife he talks confidential subjects; I knew well, hoped listening able make discovery;--what, I idea of; but, bad feelings stimulated me, I determined lose opportunity. It till week I selected berth, I made discovery. I watch six eight of the clock, gone bed early. About nine of the clock father came state-room. Your mother already bed. As father undressed, mother said, 'Does belt worry great deal, dear?' "'No,' replied father, 'I used now; I first put on, I four days, I feel it. I shall keep long weather lasts; saying may happen, looking belt moment's warning.' "'Do think danger?' "'No, particularly so, storm fierce, vessel old weak. We may fine weather day two, may not; events, property value stake, property own, I feel culpable, I take every precaution.' "'Well--I wish safe home again, dear, father his diamonds, hands God.' "'Yes, I must trust Him,' replied father. "This circumstance induced look one chinks bulkhead, I could see father, I perceived he unbuckling belt round his body, doubt contained diamonds referred to. It soft leather, eight inches wide, sewed lengthways breadthways small squares, I presumed diamonds deposited. After time mother spoke again. "'I really think, Henniker, I ought wear belt.' "'Why so, dear?' "'Because might means preservation case accident. Suppose now, obliged abandon vessel take boats; husband, his hurry, might forget his wife, he would forget his diamonds. If I wore belt, would certain put boat.' "'That observation would force husbands, wives,' retorted father; 'but I firm belief Scriptures, affect me. What Proverbs say? "The price virtuous woman far rubies;" good ruby worth even market diamond size.' "'Well, I must comfort idea,' replied mother, laughing. "'Supposing thrown upon out-of-the-way place,' said father, 'I shall commit belt charge. It might soon discovered person, whereas, yours, would stand every chance long concealed. I say because, even desert, would dangerous known unscrupulous unprincipled men anyone much wealth him.' "'Well,' replied mother, 'that also comfortable hear, leave behind, I shall necessary conceal treasure.' "'Yes,' replied father, laughing, 'there another chance you, see.' "Your father extinguished light, conversation renewed; I heard enough. Your father carried great treasure his person--wealth, I took granted, I could obtain, return England, would save present position. My avarice hereby excited, thus another passion equally powerful, equally inciting evil deeds, added hate I already imbibed father. But I must leave now." Jackson drank little more, remained quiet, I food day, I took opportunity returning cabin, promise I would back soon. In half hour I returned, bringing Bible Prayer-book, I thought he would ask read he made his confession. I found breathing heavily, apparently asleep, I wake him. As I looked him, recalled mind his words, "Am I object pity?" I confessed he was, I asked question, Can forgive murderer father? After reflection, I thought I could. Was he already punished? Had murder already avenged? It possible retain animosity one stricken, broken pieces, heart smote I looked his disabled hand, felt I, boy I was, share his marring. At last he spoke. "Are there, Frank?" "Yes," replied I. "I little sleep," said he. "Do feel easier?" inquired I kindly. "Yes, I feel side numbed, remain till mortification takes place. But let finish confession; I wish relieve mind, I shall die to-night, perhaps to-morrow, still I wish over. Come nearer me, I may speak lower voice, I shall able speak longer." I so, he proceeded. "You know cast upon island, I behaved first. When I afterwards took place others, evil thoughts gradually quitted me, I gave idea injury father. But last long. The deaths many, last captain father mother ones left island besides myself, excited cupidity. I thought belt diamonds, means I gain possession it; devil suggested murders captain father. I ascertained father longer carried belt his person used bathe bathing-pool; was, therefore, father proposed, mother's keeping. Having made mind, I watched every opportunity put intentions execution. It custom one us fish every morning, mother would eat dried birds, fish could procured, I considered chance I executing horrible wish father went fish rocks. We usually ledge rocks divide bathing-pool sea, I found another place, fish, better quality, taken, high wall rocks below. You know I mean, I often sent fish there, I never could go since father's death. Your father took his lines there, hauling large fish, I, concealed close he stood, watched opportunity he looked rock see fish clear water, come behind throw sea. He could swim, I knew, waiting minute two, I looked saw his body, sank, his last struggles. I hastened away, guilty conscience induced ascend ravine, collect faggot firewood bring home, suspicions might entertained; suspicion, afterwards perceive. I returned wood, captain observed, I came cabin: "'Why, it is something new collect wood turn, Jackson. Wonders never cease.' "'The fact is, I becoming amiable,' replied I, hardly knowing say, afraid look either face, mother, her lap, standing close by. "'Has husband caught fish, know, Jackson?' said mother, 'for high time he came home.' "'How I tell?' replied I. 'I ravine wood.' "'But rock two hours ago,' replied mother, 'for Captain James saw coming away.' "'That I certainly did,' replied captain. 'Had he caught fish him?' "They must perceived confusion I said, 'Yes, I rocks, I never went near Henniker, I will swear.' "'You must near him, even I saw you,' replied captain. "'I never looked him, I was,' replied I. "'Well, then, one us better go see he about,' said captain. 'Shall I leave Jackson you?' "'Yes, yes,' replied mother, much agitated, 'for I forebodings; better leave here.' "The captain hastened rocks, quarter hour returned much heated, saying, 'He there!' "'Not there?' replied I, getting up, I seated silence rock captain's absence: 'that is odd.' "'It is,' replied captain. 'Jackson, go try see anything him, I attend Mrs Henniker.' "Your mother, captain's return, bowed her head her knees, covered her face her hands. I glad excuse away, heart smote I witnessed her condition. "I remained away half-an-hour, returned, saying I could see nothing father. "Your mother cabin, captain went her, I remained outside feelings Cain upon brow. "That dreadful day parties--no food taken. Your mother captain remained cabin, I dared not, usual, go bed-place. I lay night upon rocks--sleep I could not; every moment I saw father's body sinking, I seen morning. The next morning captain came me. He grave stern, he could accuse me, whatever his suspicions might been. It week I saw mother again, I dared intrude her presence; but, finding accusation me, I recovered spirits, returned cabin, things went before." Chapter XIII "One thing, however, evident, mother aversion--I may say horror--of me, she could conceal. She said nothing, she never could look me; question I put, would seldom make reply. Strange say treatment produced quite different effect might anticipated, I felt former love her revive. Her shrinking made familiar towards her, increased her disgust. I assumed jocose air her, times Captain James considered his duty interfere check me. He powerful man, contest would proved master; I knew, knowledge compelled respectful mother his presence, his back turned I became disgustingly familiar, last mother requested whether fishing collecting wood, instead going turns go, leave her alone. This I could well refuse, Captain James would probability used force I consented, hatred consequence unbounded. However, event took place relieved subjection I under, left alone mother. Now I must rest little. Wait another hour, shall know rest." It late evening, bright moon shone head, broad light shadow made rocks around us appear peculiarly wild rugged. They towered one till met dark blue sky stars twinkled faintly, moon sailed ether, without cloud obscure her radiance. And majestic scenery found two living beings--a poor boy mangled wretch--a murderer--soon breathe his last, summoned offended God. As I remained motionless his side, I felt, I looked up, sensation awe, fear; I thought myself--"And God made world besides, him. The Bible said so:" speculation God must be, although I read Bible, I confused idea, asked me, man chariot Philip, "Understandest thou thou readest?" I certainly answered, No. I remained nearly two hours reverie, last fell asleep back rock. I was, however, wakened Jackson's voice, he asked low tone water. "There is," said I, handing him. "Have called long?" "No," replied he; "I asked once." "I asleep," said I. As soon he drunk, he said-- "I finish now; side begins burn." He proceeded-- "It four months father's death Captain James I went together ravine collect firewood. We passed wall rock, know well, went gap, call it, Captain James left water-course walked along edge wall. I followed him; us pieces rope hands tied faggots. Of sudden his foot slipped, he rolled edge rock, catching hold small bush fixed roots rocks, he saved his body hanging half precipice. "'Give end rope,' said he me, perfectly collected, although danger. "'Yes,' replied I, I intended do, I perceived I refused he could still saved bush he clung. "But bush began loosen give way, Captain James perceiving cried out-- "'Quick, quick, bush giving way!' "This assertion his determined give rope. I pretended great hurry so, entangled legs, appeared occupied clearing it, he cried again-- "'Quick!'--and hardly he said word root bush snapped, he fell below. "I heard crash he came rock beneath. See judgment God--am I precisely his position, lying battered crushed he was? After time I went he lay, found expiring. He strength say 'God forgive you,' he died. It murder, I could saved would not, yet he prayed God forgive me. How much happier I felt he said that. His 'God forgive you' rang ears months afterwards. I returned cabin, bold air stated mother happened, I felt I could say, time, I deed. She burst frantic exclamations, accusing his murderer murderer her husband. I tried I could appease her, vain. For many weeks she state melancholy despondency, made fear her life; she still bestow her affections upon, sake she lived. I soon made discovery. She wholly power, I awed her looks even, time. At last I became bolder, spoke her becoming man wife; she turned abhorrence. I resorted means. I prevented her obtaining food; she would starved pleasure, she could bear see suffer. I detail cruelty barbarity towards her; suffice say, she pined away, six months death captain she died, exhorting injure you, ever I opportunity, take grandfather. I could refuse demand, made woman I certainly killed slow means I father sudden death. I buried her guano, side others. After her death life torture long while. I dared kill you, I hated you. I one consolation, one hope, occasionally gave satisfaction; consolation, could called, was--that I possession diamonds; hope--that I one day see England again. You see now--are avenged?" I could feel truth Jackson's last sentence. They indeed avenged. After short pause, he said me-- "Now, Frank, I feel mortification side making great progress, and, short time I shall great pain talk you. I made full confession crimes; reparation I make you. Now, forgive me? I shall die miserable not. Just look me. Can feel resentment one wretched state? Recollect pray forgiven forgive others. Give answer." "I think--yes, I feel I forgive you, Jackson," replied I. "I shall soon left alone island, I sure I much miserable I shall be, I forgive you. I forgive you." "Thanks; good boy, may God bless you. Is nearly daylight?" "Yes, is. I shall soon able read Bible Prayer-book you. I here." "The pain severe, becomes worse every minute. I shall able listen now; I shall moments quiet I die; then--" Jackson groaned heavily, ceased speaking. For many hours he appeared suffer much agony, he vented low groans; perspiration hung his forehead large beads, his breathing became laborious. The sun rose nearly set Jackson spoke; last he asked drink. "It now," said he faintly. "The pain subsiding, death near hand. You may read now; but, first, I think it, let tell find father's property." "I know," replied I; "in bed-place board. I saw remove see me." "True. I say; soon. Read burial service I dead; now, still above, read think I shall like best; I cannot collect sufficiently tell proper. Indeed I hardly know. But I pray times. Read on." I so, came upon parable prodigal son. "That suits me," said Jackson. "Now let pray. Pray me, Frank." "I do not know how," replied I; "you never taught me." "Alas, no!" Jackson silent. I saw his pale lips move time. I turned away moments; I came back him, he more! His jaw fallen; first time I ever faced death, I looked upon corpse horror dismay. After minutes I left body, sat rock distance it, I somewhat afraid near it. On rock I remained till sun sinking horizon; when, alarmed idea dark, I took books hastened back cabin. I giddy excitement, tasted food many hours. As soon I eaten, I lay bed-place, intending reflect upon I do, I alone; I moments fast asleep, wake sun high. I arose much refreshed, and, seeing Bible Prayer-book close bed-place, I recollected promise Jackson I would read burial service his body. I found place Prayer-book, I read before; and, looked it, I went book body lay. It presented yet hideous spectacle night before. I read service closed book. "What I do?" thought I. "I cannot bury guano. It impossible carry body rocks." Indeed, possible, I think I could touched it. I afraid it. At last I determined I would cover fragments rocks lay directions, I so. This occupied two hours, then, carrying bottles me, I gladly hastened away spot, resolution never revisit it. I felt quite relief I cabin. I alone, true, I longer contact dead. I could collect thoughts analyse feelings remainder day. I sat head resting hand, attitude one thinking; time mind vacant. I lay sleep, following morning I found invigorated, capable acting well thinking. I weight upon spirits I could first account for; arose feeling I alone, without soul speak communicate with; lips must closed till I fell fellow-creatures--and likely? We seen perish far us, all, period many years. Chapter XIV I now, Jackson's account, nearly fourteen years old. During fourteen years one vessel seen us. It might fourteen more, double time might elapse, I fall fellow-creatures. As thoughts saddened me, I felt much I would sacrificed Jackson remained alive, his company; I would forgiven anything. I even felt if, murderer father, I lost friend. That day I unsettled I could anything; I tried read, I could not; I tried eat, appetite gone, I sat looking ocean rolled wave wave, sometimes wondering whether would ever bring fellow-creature join me; others I sat, hours, perfect vacuity thought. The evening closed in; dark, I still remained seated I was. At last I returned bed, almost brokenhearted; fortunately I soon asleep, sorrows forgotten. Another morning gladdened brilliant sun, dark blue ocean scarcely ruffled breeze swept it, I felt spirits much revived, appetite returned. After taking meal, I remembered Jackson told belt diamonds, I went his bed-place, turning bird's skins feathers, I raked gravel, two inches deep, came board. I lifted up, found underneath hole, foot deep, full various articles. There watch sleeve buttons mate, dollars wrapped old rags, tobacco-box, old pipe, brooch hair forming initials, letters signed J. Evelyn, I perceived grandfather, probably taken Jackson mother's death. I say letters, such, I afterwards found out, I ever seen letter, first attempt decipher written hand useless, although I manage make signature. There tobacco-box plain gold wedding-ring, probably mother's; also lock long dark hair, I presumed also. There three four specimens I afterwards found gold silver ores, silver pencil-case, pair small gold ear-rings. At bottom hole belt; soft leather, I could feel hard substance sewed every square, course I presumed diamonds, I cut one divisions open see them. It upper part it, plain writing, "The property Mr J. Evelyn, 33, Minories, London." I examined articles one another, satisfied curiosity, I replaced hole future survey. I covered hole board, put back gravel feathers bed-place. This occupied two hours, I took former position rocks, remained state listless inactivity body mind remainder day. This state prostration lasted many days--I may say weeks, altogether removed. I could find pleasure books, taken up, moments laid aside. It within month time birds come island. I want sustenance; plenty left, I almost loathed sight food. The reader may inquire I knew exact time arrival birds? I reply reckoning ever kept Jackson arrival full moons, also made mark rock every time moon full. Thirteen moons quantity reckoned time birds appearing island one year, re-appearance next; twelve moons passed. At length, tired everything, tired myself, I may say, almost tired life, I one day took head I would take provisions bottle hold water, go ravine, cut firewood last long while; I would remain several days, I hated sight cabin near it. The next day I acted upon resolution, slinging dry provisions shoulder, I set ravine. In hour I gained it; hurry cut wood, I resolved upon climbing higher up, see I could reach opposite side island; is, least, get brow hill, good view it. I continued climb I gained smooth grassy spot, clear brushwood; I sat rest myself, I observed blue flowers I never seen before, indeed I know flower island. As I afterwards discovered, one varieties Gentianellas. I looked them, admired them, felt quite affection them; pretty, were, well myself, alone. Jackson, I pointing English cottages landscapes "Mavor's Natural History," told great deal gardening England, wild flowers trees transplanted improved culture; roses plants nailed walls, I observed engravings, watered kept; I sat looking flower, thought occurred me, Why I take me, keep myself? I water it, take care it. I resolved I would so, I already looked upon plant treasure. I took carefully American knife, leaving sufficient mould roots, I proceeded ascend hill; I gone another hundred yards, I found least dozen plants flower, finer one I dug up, three four others different these, also quite new me. I puzzled do; I put plants I dug continued ascent, made mind. After half-an-hour's climbing, I gained summit, could perceive ocean side, half island lying beneath me. It grand height I stood on, I observed little difference one side island other; rugged barren rock side, exception portion close me; brushwood ravine, appeared sort cleft island. All silent solitary; bird seen, nothing life could I discover. I return, I thought I might well go ravine facing little way, see it. I so, discovered plants I seen side island. There also fern trees, twining plants running them, I thought myself, Why, plants I saw picture English cottages, like them. I wonder would run cabin? idea came I would plant round cabin, I would make garden flowers, plants own. The reader hardly imagine pleasure idea gave me; I sat ruminate upon it, felt quite happy time. I recollected, however, cabin built rock, plants would grow earth. At first idea chilled me, seemed destroy schemes, I resolved I would bring earth rock, make garden way. I first thought guano, Jackson told used small proportions enrich soil, would kill plants used itself. After hour's consideration, I called mind Jackson told subject, I made mind I would return cabin, return ascertain low ravine I could obtain earth garden; I would carry earth cabin, make soil ready plants flowers, then, ready, I would go ravine, collect I could, make garden. I so. I found I could get soil one-third way ravine, quarter mile brushwood grew; ascertained that, I returned cabin, threw provisions lasted week, late, I decided I would commence operations following day. I took chest duck frock, tying sleeves collar, form bag body frock, I set next morning begin task. That day I contrived carry cabin ten twelve bags mould, I put round border four feet wide, foot deep. It occupied whole week obtain quantity earth necessary make bed side cabin; hard work, made cheerful happy I before. I found best cure melancholy solitude employment, I thus obtained valuable knowledge well making garden. When I finished carrying mould, I started ravine two bags hold plants I might collect, day's toil, I returned bags full small shrubs, besides bundle creepers plant sides cabin. The following day occupied planting everything I procured. I sorry see leaves flowers hung down, I watered I went bed. The next morning I delighted perceive recovered looking quite fresh. But garden full enough please me, I went ravine, selecting plants flowers them, one two shrubs, I observed. When planted watered, garden looked gay full plants, I discovered mould came want support edges; I therefore went picked pieces rock sufficient size make border hold mould, complete, I nothing go watering daily. This I did, recollecting Jackson said guano, I got bag it, put plant. The good effect soon observable, birds came, garden flourishing condition. I cannot express reader pleasure I derived little garden. I knew every plant every shrub, talked companions, I watered tended them, I every night morning, rapid growth delight. I longer felt solitude irksome I done. I something look after, interest me, love; alive well I was; grew, threw leaves flowers; grateful care I bestowed upon them, became companions friends. I mentioned latter portion time I Jackson, he taught sing several songs. Feeling tired, solitude, hearing human voice, I found first humming over, afterwards singing aloud, various airs I collected him. This afforded much pleasure, I used sing half day. I one listen me, true, fondness garden increased, I used sit sing flowers shrubs, fancy listened me. But stock songs large, last I repeated often I became tired words. It occurred Prayer-book Psalms David end it, set music. I got book, far airs I knew would suit, I sang all; never Psalms, probably, sung tunes before, amused me, want variety language. Every three four days I would go ravine, search carefully new flower shrub I yet planted garden, I found one, I often did, source great delight. Chapter XV At last birds came, I procured eggs, agreeable change, living long upon dried meat. My want occupation occasioned also employ time fishing, I seldom done Jackson alive; created variety food, which, long while, I stranger. Jackson care fish, cook obliged go ravine wood, he like trouble. When birds came, I recourse book Natural History, read accounts Man-of-War birds, Gannets, birds mentioned it; vignette Chinaman tame cormorants pole, letter-press account trained employed catch fish masters. This gave idea I would birds tame, companions, and, possible, teach catch fish me; I knew I must wait till young birds fit taken nest. I resolved time birds mating, I would go ravine remain several days, collect bundles firewood. The firewood chiefly cut sort low bush, like sallow willow, fit making baskets, indeed fit anything better firewood; however, bushes harder texture, burnt well. It Jackson told former called willow used making baskets, he also shewed tie faggots twisting sallows together. They not, however, Jackson said were--from knowledge, I say species Oleander something kind. Having roasted several dozen eggs quite hard, way provision, I set one morning, went ravine. As Jackson said before, I walk wall rock thirty feet high, pass water-course get ravine, increased distance shrubs grew, least half mile. It wall captain fell killed, Jackson would assist him. I gained thicket bushes grew, three days I worked hard, cut tied fifty large faggots, I thought I collected enough last long while; I still carry down, heavy task, I could carry one time. It occurred I threw faggots wall opposite cut down, I save nearly mile carriage, otherwise I walk way water-course divided wall rock, walk back again. Indeed, I cut wood quarter mile bathing-pool, hill. I delighted idea, I wondered never occurred Jackson, I commenced putting execution. The top wall rock slippery constant trickling water surface, places. I carried faggots one one, threw over, careful lose footing doing. I carried three four, become careless, when, heaving one over, heels thrown up, I could recover I slid remainder ledge precipitated below, distance thirty feet. I must remained many hours insensible, last I recovered found lying faggots I thrown down. It falling faggots, instead hard rock, saved life. I rose soon I could collect scattered senses. I felt sore much shaken, blood running mouth, bones broken. I was, however, ill attempt anything day. I walked home slow pace went bed. A sound sleep restored me, day two I quite recovered. I watered plants, I found drooping, grieved long away them, I returned faggots left; lighten labour I resolved carry bathing-pool stack rocks near it. I mention reasons reader comprehend bye-and-bye. This occupied two days, I inclined, fall, work hard; glad I labour over. The young birds hatched, I wait four five weeks fit taken. I began find solitude tedious. The flowers garden bloomed withered, much interest me. I recommenced reading Bible, narratives Old New Testaments afforded pleasure. I hardly need say reader I read Bible I would read book--for amusement, instruction. I learnt little Jackson--indeed, regards true nature Christian religion, I may say, nothing all. I believe he knew anything himself. It true precepts New Testament struck me, I interested Our Saviour anybody else; I could comprehend him, his mission. In short, I read darkness; I may say I almost knew Bible heart without understanding it.--How could I? How many thousands same, without excuse offer blindness! At last time taking birds arrived, I sufficient employment keep melancholy. I collected quite many done Jackson I provided for; new knives labour comparatively easy. As soon I completed provision, I went back take young birds already I selected left purpose. It high time, I found I went take ready fly. However, good battle old birds (for I taken six young ones--two nest, arrayed force six old ones me, fought valiantly defence offspring), I succeeded carrying off, followed old birds, screamed darted close came pursuing cabin. As soon I got safe back, I took young birds cabin, tying leg piece fishing line, end line I fastened pieces rock I collected ready platform outside cabin. The old birds continued persecute till dark, went away, I, tired day's labour, sorry go sleep. When I woke next morning, I found old birds platform, company young ones, I presume trying persuade fly away them; lines legs prevented that. They leave approach little while; last took wing, went sea; course minutes returned small fish mouths, fed young ones. They continued two following days, general break up, announcing departure main body, which, much soaring wheeling air, flew northerly direction. The six parent birds, young ones cabin, appeared time uneasy, flying round round screaming wildly; last soared air loud shrieks, flew away main body, still sight--their love young overpowered instinctive habits. I sorry gone, I wanted new family myself. I went rocks caught fish, large enough supply three four days. I fed inside fish, ate heartily. For several days appeared uneasy; gradually settled, appeared know me, welcome coming, source great pleasure. I neglected flowers birds, animated two; I sat hours platform six companions, I must over-lively intelligent, alive, eyes. They seldom roused up, unless I brought fish, supply four times day, would stand legs open beaks far apart, waiting share. They great happiness me, I watched gradual increase plumage size, rapid. I gave names Natural History book. One Lion, Tiger, Panther, Bear, Horse, Jackass (at time I named them, last would appropriate all); I always called names I fed them, I soon found, great joy, knew well enough. This delighted me. I read books way amusement; I sang songs them; I talked them; I would even narrate various histories Bible them, Joseph his brethren, &c., stolid air communications received made almost imagine listened to. After time, I took line legs two them, precaution first cutting wings, two became much lively, following cabin generally staying night. As I found attempt made escape, I let loose, cut wings, behaved equally well two first I given liberty. The perfect obedience good behaviour new companions gave leisure altogether desirable, left vacuum fill up. But I returned garden. I could present water plants look increased daily growth climbers, boldly ascended sides cabin; I thought high time go ravine island, see I could add collection. One morning I set ravine. I successful, I contented carrying, long road, faggots I left behind day I fell precipice. This labour I finished, returned cabin, I met birds half-extended wings open mouths, glad see me, hungry bargain. I ought observe birds appeared separate pairs, male female, difference plumage denoted. Lion Horse always side side, Jackass Bear, Tiger Panther. I fed one one, calling name, immediately responded, anyone came called, switched trouble. The next morning I set another voyage discovery plants, time I resolved upon trying I could find among crevices rocks, I seen distance appeared pretty flower ledge one clefts. I go ravine time, commenced climbing rocks behind cabin built. It hard work, I easily discouraged, couple hours I arrived level I view I commenced labour, I amply rewarded, I found several plants quite new me, variety ferns, I thought beautiful, although flowers. The scene, I stood, awful beautiful. I looked upon rocks below, cabin, appeared small, I thought I could see birds like dots upon platform. It bright day smooth water, I could clearly distinguish islands distance, I thought I saw something like white speck close them--perhaps vessel. This made melancholy, I could help asking whether I remain life upon island, alone, chance ever taken it. As I looked upon cabin, I surprised steepness rocks I climbed, felt alarmed, I never able get back again. But thoughts soon chased away. I turned seaward, looked inland. I found one side chasm rocks, bottom far I could see it; side rock rose straight wall. My attention soon diverted discovering another plant, I commenced task digging up. I obtained, ferns, twenty new varieties, I made bundle ready carrying slung round neck, I knew I require hands descend with. Then I sat rest little I commenced return, I seated minutes, I thought I would sing song way amusement. Chapter XVI I said that, tired repeating words songs Jackson taught me, I taken Psalms metre, end Prayer-book, way variety; and, far metre went, answered well, although people would surprised heard Psalms sung quick varied measure. The Psalm I chose time first--"How blest he never consents;" I began accordingly; I came end line, astonishment I heard plaintive voice, distance, repeat "con-sents." I looked round. I thought I must deceived, I continued--"By ill advice walk." This time I could mistaken--"to walk" repeated voice plainly possible. I stopped singing, lost wonder. There must somebody island well myself, thought I; I never heard echo before, except thundered, echoes I put portion thunder. "Who is there?" cried I. "Who is there?" replied voice. "It is me!" "It is me!" answer. I know make it. I cried again, I heard I said repeated, answer questions. I thought I insulted somebody, yet, I listened, voice spoke came face rock side chasm, one could without seeing them. This made think I mistaken, could anybody, still I could solve mystery. At last I became frightened, sun setting, I determined get back cabin. I so, went much faster I gone up, grew dark I became alarmed. The thing re-assured softness plaintiveness voice--not like Jackson's, someone would think injuring me. Although I was, generally speaking, quiet content isolated position, yet I employed amused favourites. At times, I could find anything do, overcome weariness. I would throw away books, remain hours thinking upon probability ever seeing fellow creature; fit melancholy would come me, would last many days. I one moods, occurred me, that, although I seen side island summit, I gone beach explore it; I resolved I would so, making trip three four days. When knives become blunt, Jackson told sharpen them, rubbing blades upon hard flat piece rock, wetted water. This I found answer well, I determined I would try sharpen one old axes way, make serviceable, I much afraid breaking knives cutting brushwood, I knew much rapidly could done axe. I picked large stone, suitable purpose, kid water hand, I set-to sharpen axe. It long job, day two I succeeded admirably, axe good order. I thought I could leave birds many days, would require food. At last, I considered I caught two large fish cut up, would sufficient sustenance. I so, provided packet dried birds food, tied duck frock, Natural History book amusement, pannikin get water in, axe shoulder, knives side--I first kissed birds, told remain quiet good till I came back--I set bright clear morning tour examination. In couple hours I gained summit island, prepared descent, sitting eating dinner. I observed that, before, water side island quite smooth, compared side I resided. It was, fact, prevailing winds year, lee side island. Having rested sufficiently, I commenced descent, I accomplished little less time took ascend side. As I neared rocks shore, I thought I perceived something occasionally moving them. I mistaken, I came closer, I found several large animals lying rocks, occasionally dropping sea close them. The sight anything living great interest. I determined get nearer, ascertain animals were. At last, creeping along rock rock, I arrived within forty yards them. I recollected animals shape book Natural History, which, fortunately, I duck frock, sitting behind rock, I pulled out, turned pages I came print exactly answered appearance. It Seal. Having satisfied point, I read history animal, found easily tamed, affectionate taken young, also might easily killed blow nose. These, least, two important pieces information. It occurred would pleasant young seal playmate (for Gannets, all, intelligent), I resolved obtain one I could. I put duck frock provisions behind rock, taking axe hand, I cautiously advanced animals lay. There twenty together one rock, large, seemed five six feet long. I could see small one anywhere, I walked behind rocks farther right, towards another rock, I saw another batch lying. As I neared them, I saw herself seal young one her side, two feet long. This I wanted. They lay distance water, upon low rock. I watched time, much amused prattling passed old young one. I thought obtain young one, I must course kill old one, I perceived large teeth. I considered advisable get water, might escape me, I contrived I made appearance. As soon old one perceived running them, gave shrill cry, floundered towards water; came close together, showed teeth, rose upon flappers defend young one, kept close side; blow nose axe rendered motionless, apparently dead. Delighted success, I seized hold young one took arms, carrying away, I found confronted male seal, which, alarmed cry female, come her assistance. It much larger female, shaggy hair neck shoulders, apparently fierce. I could pass it, shore me, I time drop young seal, leap behind rock one side, axe ready. The animal reared rock pass me, I saluted blow head, staggered it. I lost presence mind creature coming upon unexpectedly, blow well aimed, could recover first blow, another nose tumbled over, appearance lifeless. I hastened gain side rock, I left young seal, found crept mother's body, fondling it. I took arms, retreated I left duck frock, throwing everything else out, I put animal in, tied end, could escape. I sat recover excitement occasioned first engagement I ever in, quite delighted newly-acquired treasure. I thought I do. It within hour dark, late return side island, I would done so, I anxious get seal home. At last I decided I would go farther beach, take quarters night. I collected provision, seal arm, I walked away one hundred yards water's edge, took position large rock; I ate supper, untied line closed frock, parting look little friend I went sleep. He struggled good deal first, quiet, although he occasionally made attempts bite me. I coaxed fondled good deal, put his bag again, made secure, appeared annoy much, he half quiet bag he I held lap. I took book read history seal, I found skins valuable, also gave great deal oil, I use oil, though I thought skins might comfortable bed-place. I shut book lay sleep, I could obtain till near daylight, I excited, anxious treasure. The sun shining eyes woke up; I found seal lying quiet; I touched see he dead, cry he gave assured contrary. I walked back I left bodies parents. I found examination dead, also furs beautiful, I resolved I would skins. But difficulty. If I took skins, I could carry me, I anxious get young one home, lest die hunger, I decided I would first take home young one, give food warm it, return skin old ones. I therefore made breakfast, leaving remainder provision cleft rock, I might trouble bringing again, I set return, used diligence I back cabin noon. I found birds well, apparently quite satisfied provision I left them, asleep, awake notice arrival. "Ah," thought I, "you like I give you; next time I go away I leave hungry, see come back, flutter wings gladness." I puzzled put seal keep safe: last I decided upon opening seaman's chest putting that. I so, gave piece fish birds eaten. The little creature devoured eagerly, I took lines went catch fish supply. In half hour I returned two large fish, I took seal chest fed again. He ate heartily; I glad perceive he appeared much tamer already. I threw insides fish birds, become inferior interest me. Having fed animals, I thought myself, and, I took meal, I arranged next morning I would go side island, skin two seals, spread skins rocks dry, would leave till I better opportunity bringing cabin; present I could away new acquaintance, I wished make tame fond me. Having fed morning, I put lid chest, started lee side island. Chapter XVII I arrived early, skinned seals, dragged skins water-side, though difficulty, especially large one, rock I taken quarters night before. Here I spread dry, putting large pieces rock upon edges, might blown away. It nearly dusk I finished, I set off, hour dark arrived cabin; I knew way well, I got ground twice fast I before. I crawled bed-place dark, slept soundly fatigue. I awoke next morning plaintive cry seal chest, I hastened get fish feed with. I took fed him; astonished tame little animal become already. He remained quietly he fed, nestling close side, I his mother, even making half attempt follow I left him. My birds appeared dull stupid, I observed also dirty, always rushed kid full water, trying get it. This made think required bathing salt water, I took one bathing-pool, long line leg, put in. The manner poor creature floundered, dipped washed itself, several minutes, proved supposition correct; so, allowing half hour recreation, I took back, went others indulged luxury bath; time, I took almost every day, astonishing much brighter sleeker plumage became. I remained week cabin, taming seal, quite fond me; one night, I going bed, he crawled bed-place, time he bed-fellow. At end week I went side island, contrived carry two skins summit. It hard day's work. The day afterwards I conveyed cabin, and, quite dry, I put bed-place lie upon, I like smell birds' feathers, although I long accustomed them. And now, seal, birds, garden, occupation gave me, time passed quickly away, until, reckoning, nearly period birds come again. I observed, time drew near, birds uneasy. They paired, I mentioned before, plumage complete, evident paired male female, I supposed. They tethered long while, appeared much inclined fly, especially male birds. At first I thought I would cut wings, I fearful would join birds arrival, observing fond mates, I resolved cut wing females only, I think male birds would leave them. I so, took chance; since I seal companion, I care much birds before. At last birds came, took possession guano-ground usual, I went fresh eggs; time I found females scratching, would make nests, days afterwards began lay. I thought soon young ones would wish go away, I took eggs laid, prevent them, I found fast I took away eggs laid more, nearly two months, supplying fresh eggs long wild birds hatched, left island. The male birds, time females first laid eggs, tried wings short flights circles, flew away sea. I thought gone, I deceived, returned quarter hour, fish beak, laid mates. I much pleased this, I resolved future supply food, did; food only, enough seal also weather fine, rough, could obtain any, I obliged feed them. The way I obtained extra supply fish was, first went out, I seized, return, fish brought, often I would go more, females fed. But I one difficulty contend with, was, time birds could obtain fish, weather rough, I could either, would take bait. After cogitation, I decided I would divide portion bathing-pool farthest shore, wall loose rock water could flow through, fish could get of, I would catch fish fine weather feed seal birds weather rough bad. As soon I finished curing stock provisions got safely housed cabin, I set work make wall, take long while, water two feet deep, pool ten yards across. As soon finished, I went every day, fine, caught many fish I thought I might require, put portion bathing-pool. I found plan answer well, fish lived, I great difficulty getting I wanted them, would take bait. As birds longer trouble me, rather, contrary, profit, I devoted whole time seal. I required name him, reading book Natural History certain lion called Nero, I thought good name seal, bestowed accordingly, although Nero meant I idea of. The animal tame he would cry ever I left him, would follow far he could rocks, one part path leading bathing-pool difficult him, he would remain crying till I came back. I taken bathing-pool wash him, he much pleased I did. I resolved I would clear path rocks, he might able follow whole way, he grown much I found heavy carry. It occupied week I could roll away remove smaller rocks, knock others axe, I finished last, pleased find animal followed right plunged water. He since I made wall rock keep fish in, soon he in, he dived came one fish, he brought land. "So now," thought I, "I shall know get fish I want them--I shall bring down, Nero." I may well observe Nero soon obeyed orders faithfully dog. I little switch, he wrong, I would give slight tap nose. He would shake his head, show his teeth, growl, come fondly me. As he used follow every day pool, I break going fish I want taken, I accomplished. No one witnessed it, could imagine affection docility animal, love I him. He companion playmate day, bedfellow night. We inseparable. It latter portion second year solitude circumstance occurred, I must relate. Nero gone pool me, I standing fishing rocks, he came pool plunged sea, playing sorts gambols, whistling delight. I think anything it. He plunged disappeared minutes, would come close line was, he disturbed fish I could catch any. To drive farther off, I pelted pieces rock, one hit hard, he dived down. After time I pulled line, whistling return, although I see him, I went away cabin, fully expecting he would soon follow me, he could walk (after his fashion) cabin pool he pleased. This early morning, I busied garden, great luxuriance, I dressed guano; observing noon he returned, I became uneasy, went pool look him. He there, I looked sea, could perceive anywhere. I called whistled, use, I grew much alarmed idea treasure deserted me. "It could I threw pieces rock him," thought I; "he would leave that." I remained two three hours, watching him, vain; seal--no Nero,--my heart sank idea animal deserted me, first time life, far I recollect, I burst flood tears. For first time life, I may say, I felt truly miserable--my whole heart affections set upon animal, companion friend solitude, I felt existence burden without him. After while, I retraced steps cabin, I miserable, I express. I could rest quiet. Two hours sunset, I went rocks, called till I hoarse. It vain; night closed in, I returned cabin, threw bed-place utter despair. "I thought he loved me," said I myself, "loved I loved him; I would left way." And tears burst anew idea I never see poor Nero again. The reader may think grief inordinate unwarrantable, let put position--a lad sixteen, alone desolate island, one companion--true, he animal, could speak, he affectionate; he replied caresses; he companion friend, object I loved cared about. He intelligent, I thought loved much I loved him, he deserted me, I nothing else I cared cared me. My tears flowed hour, till last I wearied fell asleep. Chapter XVIII It early morning, yet dark, I felt something touch me. I started up--a low cry pleasure told Nero, side. Yes, Nero, come back, climbed steep path cabin, return his master. Need I say I overjoyed, I hugged he human being, I wept him, minutes afterwards asleep together bed-place. Such fact, never life, great transition grief joy. "Oh! now, left me,"--said I him, next morning, I got up; "you naughty seal, frighten make unhappy did!" Nero appeared quite happy I reunion, affectionate ever. I must pass many months words, stating reader position end three years, I alone upon island. I arrived age near seventeen, tall strong years. I left wearing dress skins birds, substituted one seaman's shirts, I found chest. This, however, whole costume, although, longer would correct, still, I companion Nero, necessary particular, I society. During three years, I think I read Bible Prayer-book, Natural History book, least five six times quite through, possessing retentive memory, could almost repeat heart; still I read Bible sealed book, I understand it, one instruct me, grace bestowed upon me. I read amusement, nothing more. My garden flourishing condition, climbing plants overrun cabin, completely cover whole roof every portion it, hung festoons side door-way. Many plants I taken small, I moved them, proved trees, waving breeze, high cabin roof; everything I planted, continual watering guano, grown luxuriantly. In fact, cabin covered sheltered, original form totally disappeared, looked like arbour clump trees, rocks bathing-pool picturesque appearance. I had, course, several times gone ravine, axe become useful, I gradually accumulated large stock wood bathing-pool, I could use long while, I seldom lighted fire, cutting employment, employment great source happiness. I several times side island, encounters seals, I killed many, I found skins comfortable useful cabin. I collected three dozen finest skins, I required, I taken reason I collected firewood, sake employment, instance, I may add, sake excitement combats seals afforded me. I narrated conflicts, I thought might weary reader, I must, however, state occurred one occasion, although ludicrous, nearly cost life. I attacked large male seal, splendid fur, I always looked best skinned animals. He lying rock close water, I gone water cut prevent his escape plunging in, he would otherwise done; I aimed usual blow his nose, foot slipped wet rock, I missed animal, time fell rock axe hand. The animal, male largest size, seized hold shirt (which I wore) his teeth, and, plunging sea, dived deep water. It fortunate he seized shirt instead body, also I could swim well. He carried along him--the shirt, seconds, drawn head, when, disembarrassing garment, slipping head arms out, I left his possession, regained surface water, almost suffocated. It fortunate I wear sleeve-buttons; I them, I could disengaged myself, must perished. I climbed rock again, turning round, I perceived seal surface, shaking shirt great wrath. This sad discomfiture, I lost shirt axe, I dropped I dragged water; nothing saved except knife, I carried lanyard round neck. Why I mention circumstance particularly, is, felt great inconvenience want sleeve-buttons hold wristbands shirt together, I thought making use mate, reader may recollect given his watch Jackson's care, take home his wife; second consideration I thought possible I might lose them, decided property trust, I right risk it. This correct feeling part, therefore, probably saving life. I mention birds, I merely say went before; bathed constantly, right season laid eggs, male birds caught fish brought cabin, stupid uninteresting first; however, never left me, indeed shewed intention leave me, first season birds returning island. They useful ornamental, interesting one intelligent companion Nero. Having brought history, words, time referred to, I come narrative occurred produce change condition. I said chest spy-glass, wetted salt-water, useless. Jackson tried shew use it, shewn correctly, glasses dimmed wet subsequent evaporation heat. I taken glasses cleaned them, except field-glass called, composed two glasses, water penetrated them, still remained dull nothing could distinguished it, time Jackson shewing use instrument; therefore put one side useless. A year afterwards, I took out, curiosity, I discovered moisture two glasses quite dried up, I could see clearly it, little practice I could use well anybody else. Still I seldom use it, eyesight particularly keen, I require it, vessel coming island, I gradually given thoughts it. It one evening weather rough sea much agitated, I thought I saw something unusual water, four miles distant. I supposed first might spermaceti whale, numbers used play round island certain seasons, I used watch blowing gambols, I may use term, Jackson often told long stories whale fisheries; ray setting sun made object appear white, I ran glass, made boat small vessel, sail out, running gale right island. I watched till dark much interest, thoughts various kinds chasing other; I began consider best do. I knew hour moon would rise, sky cloudy, although wind sea high, I probably able see again. "But never get shore side island," thought I, "with much sea. Yes might, ran bathing-pool." After thinking while, I decided I would go bathing-pool, place lighted faggots rocks side entrance, would shew run for, get in. I waited little longer, taking spy-glass tinder me, I went pool, carried two faggots rocks side, set fire taken others replace soon burnt out, I sat spy-glass see I could make boat might be. As moon rose, I descried her within mile island, her head directed towards beacon lights made burning faggots. I threw another faggot went supply. The gale increased, spray dashed rocks faggots burning, threatened extinguish them, I put wood kept fierce blaze. In quarter hour I could distinguish boat; close island, perhaps three hundred yards distant, steering directly lights, along shore. The fact hauled up, knowing could land observed two lights clear other, understood made; moment afterwards bore right entrance bathing-pool, came rushing rolling seas. I still trembled them, I knew sea receded time came ledge rocks entrance, boat would dashed pieces, although lives might saved, fortunately them, so--on contrary, came borne huge wave carried clear ledge, right wall rock I made across pool, boat grounded. "Hurrah! well done, that," said voice boat. "Lower away sail, lads; all's right." The sail lowered down, then, light fire, I discovered several people boat. I much excited say anything; indeed, I know say. I felt I alone, reader may imagine joy delight. Chapter XIX As soon sail lowered, men leaped sides boat water, waded rocks. "Who you?" said one men, addressing me, "and many here?" "There one island myself," replied I; "but I am glad come." "Are you? Then perhaps you will tell us get something eat, hearty?" replied he. "Oh yes, wait little, I will bring plenty," replied I. "Well, then, look smart, that is beauty, hungry enough eat you, find us nothing better." I go cabin birds, another man called out-- "I say--can get us water?" "Oh yes, plenty," replied I. "Well then, I say, Jim, hand us pail boat." The one addressed so, man put hands, saying, "Bring us pail, boy, you?" I hastened cabin, filled pail full water, went quantity dried birds, I hastened bathing-pool; I found men idle, taken faggots stack made large fire rocks, busy making sort tent boat's sails. "Here is water, here is birds," said I, I came them. "Birds! birds?" said man first spoken me, appeared control rest. He took one examined light fire, exclaiming, "Queer eating, I expect." "Why, did not expect regular hotel landed, you, mate?" said one men. "No, I had, I would called glass grog," replied he. "I suspect I might call long I get anyone bring one here." As I knew Jackson called rum name grog, I said, "There is plenty grog, want any." "Is there, hearty,--where?" "Why, cask that is water side little ship," replied I. "I draw directly." "What! cask? Grog floating salt water, that is bad. Come you--You are earnest, boy--no joking I hope, may repent it." "I am joking," said I--"there is." The man, followed rest, excepting one party, waded water, went cask rum. "Take care," said I, "the spiles in." "So I see--never fear, hearty--come us." So saying, whole laid hold cask chains, lifting up, carried clean water, placed rocks side pool. "Hand us little kid boat, Jim," said man; "we will soon see it is right stuff." He took spiles, drew liquor, tasting it, swore excellent. It handed round, men took some. "We are luck to-night; we are fallen upon legs," said first man. "I say, Jim, put dried chickens pitch-kettle along taters bag--they will make good mess; cask grog go to, shall not badly." "I say, old fellow," said he, turning me, "you are regular trump. Who left shore get ready us?" "I born here," replied I. "Born here! well, we will hear to-morrow--just now, we will make lost time, we have nothing eat drink since Wednesday morning. Look alive, lads! get hurricane-house. Jim, put pail water kettle, send islander another pailful, grog." The pail handed me, I soon returned full, and, I see pannikin, I brought one gave them. "You are fine boy," said mate; (as I afterwards found he was). "And now, I say, hold out? Have hut cave live in?" "Yes," replied I; "I cabin, large enough you." "No, no! do not want go there--we well are, alongside cask rum, see, lad, woman here." "A woman!" said I; "I never saw woman. Where she?" "There she is, sitting fire." I looked round, perceived one party wrapped blanket, wide straw hat head, completely concealed form me. The fact is, woman looked like bundle, remained fire quite inanimate. At saying I never saw woman, man burst loud laugh. "Why, say born island, boy?" said mate last. "Were born without mother?" "I cannot recollect mother--she died I young; therefore I said, I never seen woman." "Well, that is explained; see, lad--this woman, particular sort woman; her remain supper--for supper, men may take drop much, behave themselves; I asked cabin, might take her sleep. Can that?" "Yes," replied I; "I take her there, she wishes go." "That is right then, she will better here, events. I say, boy, leave trousers?" "I never wear any." "Well then, any, I advise put on, quite old enough breeched." I remained supper cooking, asking manner questions, caused great mirth. The pitch kettle, large iron pot three short legs, surprised good deal, I never seen thing before, anything put fire. I asked was, made of. The potatoes also astonished me, I never yet seen edible root. "Why, life?" said one men. "On island," replied I, naively. I waded water examine boat well I could light fire, I could see little, obliged defer examination till next day. Before supper cooked eaten, I did, however, gain following information. That portion crew whaler, struck reef rocks seventy miles off, obliged leave her immediately, she fell her broadside minutes afterwards; left two boats, know become boat, parted company night. The captain six men boat, mate six men one landed--besides lady. "What is lady?" said I. "I mean woman sits there; her husband killed people Sandwich Isles, she going home England. We consort, another whaler, taken cargo oil board, gone England her cargo, missionary's wife sent home her." "What is missionary?" inquired I. "Well, I do not exactly know; he preacher goes teach savages." By time supper cooked, odour pitch kettle savoury anything I ever yet smelt. The kettle lifted fire, contents poured kid, given portion small kid woman, still remained huddled blanket fire, sat round large kid, commenced supper. "Come, boy, join us," said mate, "you cannot supper; you have found one us, it is hard share us." I sorry he told me, I must say I never enjoyed repast much life. "I say, boy, good stock dried chickens yours?" said mate. "Yes, I great many, enough last long many people." "Well, get more, cannot we?" "No!" replied I, "not birds come again, next five moons." "Five moons! mean?" "I mean, five full moons must come, one another." "Oh, I understand; must remain island." "No," replied I, "we must go, shall starve; I glad come, sooner go better. Will take Nero you?" "Who Nero?" "Nero--my seal--he is tame." "Well, we will see it; events," said he, turning men, "we must decide upon something, quickly, shall starve remain time." It appeared left whaler hurry, time throw boat two breakers water, four empty breakers fill saltwater ballast boat, iron pitch kettle, large sack potatoes. As soon supper finished, went cask rum, mate said me-- "Now I will go speak woman, shall take her sleep cabin." During whole time woman, mate called her, never spoken word. She taken her supper, eaten silence, still remaining fire, huddled blanket. On mate speaking her, she rose up, I perceived she much taller I thought she could been; her Panama hat still concealed her face altogether. "Now then, lad," said mate, "shew lady she sleep, join us like." "Will come me?" said I, walking away. The woman followed path. When arrived platform opposite cabin, I recollected Nero, I ordered stay till return. "You will not afraid seal," said I, "will you? he good-natured. Nero, come here." It rather dark Nero came shuffling up, I went forward coax him, he snarled little seeing stranger. "Have light hand?" said companion, speaking first time soft, yet clear voice. "No, I not, I get tinder, make fire one faggots, able see." "Do so, then, good lad," replied she. I thought her voice pleasing. I soon lighted faggot enabled her see Nero (who quite quiet) also interior cabin. She examined cabin bed-places, said, "Where sleep?" I replied shewing her bed-place. "And this," said I, pointing one opposite, "was Jackson's, sleep that. Nero sleeps me. Here plenty seal skins keep warm cold. Are clothes wet?" "No, quite dry now," replied she; "if get seal skins, I lie them, I tired." I spread five six skins one other, Jackson's bed-place, I went threw another faggot fire, might light. "Do want anything else?" said I. "Nothing, I thank you. Are going bed now?" "I meaning go men, I think it, I like leave alone Nero, he might bite you. Are afraid him?" "No, I am much afraid, still I wish bitten, I used sleep animals, are." "Well then, I will tell we will manage it. I take skins outside, sleep there. Nero leave me, will not afraid. The weather clearing fast, there is little wind was--besides, daylight three four hours." "As please," reply. Accordingly I took seal skins platform, spreading them, I lay upon them, wishing her good-night, Nero soon joined me, fast asleep minutes. Chapter XX Nero, early riser, woke day-break, I slept much longer; I tired fatigue excitement night before. As soon I up, I looked cabin, found woman fast asleep; her straw hat off, she lain her clothes. Her black hair hanging her shoulders. Having seen Jackson his bushy beard, I somewhat surprised I first saw men landing comparatively clear hair face; astonishment clear white skin woman--and instance, peculiarly white pallid--was great. I also perceived much delicate her features men; her teeth, too, white, Jackson's discoloured bad; I longed see her eyes, closed. Any difference I could perceive, she drawn blanket close her chin. "This woman," said I myself: "yes, it is like I used see dreams." I looked little longer, then, hearing Nero coming cabin behind me, afraid she would awake, I made hasty retreat. I remained part cabin considering I do. I thought I would light fire, go fish broil embers her breakfast, I called Nero come me. On arriving pool, I found seamen fast asleep tent made boat's sails; appeared much Jackson used he got drunk night before; I presumed therefore, state, far wrong. Nero went pool brought fish, I ordered him, I walked boat examine it. This took half hour, I sorry none men awake, I might ask questions I wished. I examined pitch-kettle, boat's sails, breakers. Breakers small casks, holding six seven gallons water, handy boats. I remained hour, went back cabin, carrying faggot shoulder, Nero following fish his mouth. We met woman, came cabin; she longer blanket round her, beautiful bright morning, warm. "Nero bringing breakfast," said I, "so ought like him." "I dare say I shall, companions future," replied she. "Do want anything?" said I. "Yes, little water, get some." I filled kid spring, put her, took inside fish, fed birds, crowding round me. The woman washed her face hands, braided her hair, sat rock. In meantime, I lighted faggot, cleaned fish, waited till wood burnt ashes I put fish fire. Having nothing do, I thought reading would amuse woman, I went Bible. "Shall I read you?" said I. "Yes," replied she, astonishment her looks. I read her history Joseph his brethren, favourite story Bible. "Who taught read?" said she, I shut book, put fish embers. "Jackson," said I. "He good man, he not?" replied she. I shook head. "No, good," said I, last. "If knew him, would say same; he taught read." "How long island?" said she. "I born it, father mother dead, Jackson died three years ago--since I quite alone, Nero me." She asked great many questions, I gave her short narration passed, Jackson told me; I also informed her I procured food, must soon leave island, many, food would last till birds came again. By time fish cooked, I took fire put kid, sat breakfast; hour so, become sociable. I must however stop little describe her. What men told quite true. She lost her husband, intending proceed England. Her name Reichardt, her husband German, German family. She was, I since ascertained, thirty-seven years old, tall elegant; she must handsome she younger, she suffered much hardship following her husband she done, vicissitudes his travels. Her face oval; eyes black large; her hair black raven's wing; her features small regular; her teeth white good; her complexion pallid, vestige colour her cheeks. As I since thought, like marble statue anything I compare her to. There degree severity her countenance she smile, seldom she did. I certainly looked upon her awe regard, time I became acquainted her; yet her voice soft pleasant, her manners amiable; must remembered I never seen woman. After breakfast over, I proposed going seamen lay, see awake, I told her I thought would be. "I go you, I left basket things mine boat, well bring once." We therefore set together, I ordered Nero stay cabin. On arrival pool found men still fast asleep; her directions I went water boat, brought basket small bundle she pointed out. "Shall I wake them?" said I. "No, no," replied she; "so long sleep, harm. But," said she, "we may well take potatoes us; fill handkerchiefs," continued she, taking two bundle. I so, she took one I other, returned cabin. "Are birds food?" said she, looking pile cabin. "Yes," replied I. "But potatoes?" "We roast fire like," said she; "but present better take cabin. Did plant flowers creepers grow cabin?" "Yes," replied I. "I alone nothing do, I thought I would make garden." "They pretty. Now I back, go men please, tell them, wake up, I wish smallest boat's sails, make screen of. Tell mate, he civil." "I will," said I. "Is anything else?" "Yes, bring potatoes; let take say I told you." "Shall I take Nero me?" "Yes, I want his company, I little afraid him." I called Nero, came me, went pool, I found men woke up, busy, lighting fire, washing potatoes, trying catch fish pool. "Oh, he is. Come, boy, got breakfast? We have trying catch fish, they are quick eels." "Nero soon catch want," replied I. "Here, Nero, in." Nero plunged in, soon brought fish, I sent another. "Thanks, lad," said mate; "that enough breakfast. That seal handy fellow, well trained." While men getting breakfast, one went Nero, I believe intention making friends him, Nero rejected his advances, showed his sharp teeth, snapping several times. The man became angry, caught piece rock throw seal. He aimed animal's nose, narrowly missed hitting it. Had he done so, he would probably killed it. This made angry, I told man again; upon this, he caught another, throw it, I seized collar left hand, right drawing American knife, I threatened stab it, he attacked beast. The man started back, doing, fell piece rock, his back. This quarrel brought mate us, along two three men. My knife still lifted up, mate said-- "Come, hearty, knives, do not allow them. That is English. Put up, one shall hurt beast, I promise you. Bob, fool, could not leave animal alone? You forget among savages, here." At this, men burst laugh. "Yes," observed one; "I swear, I get back, natives island savages, eat raw flesh, seals playmates, do not wear clothes enough common decency." This made laugh more, man attacked Nero, got upon his legs again, joined others; good-humour. The men sat breakfast, I examined boat again, afterwards asked many questions, much amused, every observing, "Well, he savage!" After breakfasted, I made Nero catch another fish sent cabin it, I afraid man might injury, told mate woman desired bring potatoes. "Take them," said he; "but nothing carry with. Here, fill pail, I go cabin you." "She told I ask small boat's sail, hang screen." "Well, she shall boat's mizen. We do not want it. I will carry up." The mate threw sail yard his shoulder, followed cabin. On arrival, found missionary's wife sitting platform, Nero lying far her, fish beside him. The mate took his hat, saluted new companion, saying, "That he hoped she comfortable last night." "Yes," replied she, "as much I could expect; I turned good lad his cabin, I wish again, therefore I requested sail screen. Now, John Gough, intend do?" continued she. The mate replied, "I came see quantity provisions lad might have. By his account, last month, take time reach likely fall vessel. Stay cannot, shall eat provision lose time, therefore, sooner better." "If take provision, course take lad you?" replied she. "Of course will." "And chest, seal?" inquired I. "Yes, chest, certainly, seal, I know say that--he starved boat, give his liberty, he well enough." "What say true," replied woman. "I afraid, boy, part friend. It better you." I made reply, cut heart think parting Nero; still I sense enough perceive said right. The mate went cabin, examined heap dried birds I collected, made his calculation, said sufficient three weeks, more. "And think leaving island?" inquired woman. "The day to-morrow, I persuade men, madam," replied he; "but know easy manage, thoughtless, especially unexpectedly fallen liquor." "That I admit," replied she; "but probably take liquor boat, make great difference." "I shall go speak they are sober," replied mate, "and let know evening, to-morrow morning, perhaps, better." The mate saluted her touching his hat, left us. Chapter XXI There one thing made great impression conversation men morning. They called Savage, said I sufficient clothes on; I observed dressed jackets trousers, covered head foot, I took granted shirt, I wore, sufficient clothing. This never occurred before, reader surprised it. I like first parents Eden--naked ashamed--but I suddenly come contact fellow-men, I felt something amiss. The consequence was, I went chest got pair white trousers, put on. I thought uncomfortable unnecessary articles, others wore them, I felt I must also. They rather long me, I rolled bottoms legs, I observed seamen did, came platform, missionary's wife still seated, looking upon waves lashed rocks. She immediately observed addition I made dress, said, "That great improvement. Now look like people. What name? told me." When I answered question, I said her-- "I brought potatoes, call them; I them?" "First tell me, spot know island mould--that is, earth, like garden--where plant them?" "Yes," replied I, "there there," I pointed one-third ravine. "I brought earth there, plenty it; good planting them?" "Because," said she, "one potatoes planted will, short time, grow, produce perhaps thirty forty potatoes roots large these; excellent things food, nothing else had, may means preserving life." "Well, may be," replied I, "and going remain island, would well plant them, going away day to-morrow, what is use it? I know nice, I supper last night." "But think world, others?" replied she. "Suppose, two three years hence, another boat cast away island, find, have, here, provisions ready them, would starve miserably; whereas, plant potatoes, may find plenty food saved. Only think glad father mother would found potatoes island thrown it. We must live ourselves, must think try good others--that duty Christian." "I think right," replied I, "and kind person too. If wish I go plant potatoes day. How I plant them?" "They shovel boat," said she, "for I saw throwing water it. Go get it, I go show you." I went mate gave shovel, I carried her. I found her cutting potatoes pieces, she showed she cut them, leaving eye piece, explained reason it. I soon busy cutting away alongside her, long pail potatoes ready planted. We walked ravine, she showed use shovel, I made holes. Before noon planted cut, still two handkerchiefs full first brought us. We returned cabin, I prepared fish dinner. After embers, she wished screen put beside her bed-place. "Go mate," said she, "and ask hammer three four nails. I know boat." "I may well take birds dinner," replied I, "for want them." "Yes, so; come back soon can." The mate gave hammer, article I never seen before, five six nails, I returned cabin, nailed sail screen. "Now able sleep bed-place to-night," said she. I made reply, I could imagine I could done night before, I gone cabin she might frightened Nero close her. After eaten dinner, she said me-- "How could contrive live island, dried birds?" "How?" replied I; "why, badly. I might catch fish; times year catch fish, will not take bait, neither weather rough. Besides, I two lines, I might lose both--then would become me? I starve." "Well, then, see circumstances, well plant potatoes, people may come position." "Yes, true, shall long now, do not know glad I go. I want see things I read books. I want go England look somebody; do not know I know; day I tell all--everything. I tired living myself--nothing say--no one talk to--no one care for, except Nero, he cannot speak. I cannot bear idea parting though." "Would rather stay island Nero, go away without him?" "No," replied I; "go I must, still I like part him. He friend I ever had, I remember." "When lived longer, mixed world, poor boy, find many sacrifices obliged make, much serious parting animal attached to. I suppose expect happy ever get back England?" "Of course I do; I be?" replied I; "I shall always happy." The Missionary's wife shook her head. "I fear not. Indeed, I think live long enough, acknowledge happiest days passed barren rock." "Jackson said otherwise," replied I. "He always grieving island, able get back England, he told many stories England, done there, beautiful place is, I am sure I shall like better here, even I somebody me." "Well, hands God, must put trust him. He he thinks best you--that know, read Bible." "No, I did not know that," replied I. "God lives beyond stars, long way off." "Is gained reading Bible?" inquired she, looking face. "No, all," replied I; "but I understand great deal I read, I want one tell me. I glad came men boat, I never saw woman before. I used see somebody dreams, I know woman. It mother, I seen her long now, I nobody Nero." "My poor boy, father heaven." "Yes," replied I; "I know he heaven, mother, Jackson said good." "I mean Heavenly Father, God. Do say Lord's Prayer, 'Our Father art heaven.' You must love him." I reply, John Gough, mate, came up, told companion he speaking men, agreed day next would, weather permitted, leave island; examined boat, found required little repair, would ready next day. "I hope overload boat," said she. "I fear will, I must I prevent it. The cask rum rather unfortunate discovery, better without it. Leave not, must put boat possibly without, shall nine us, plenty weight addition cask." "You promised take chest, remember," said I. "Yes, I I possibly can; recollect, I may able keep promise--for liquor, men obey before, madam," said mate. "Perhaps he better take best his clothes bundle, case refuse take chest; I must say that, loaded boat be, much blame refuse, boat small stowage, there is provisions put her, take deal room." "That true," replied woman. "It better leave chest here, I think boat hold it. You must mind chest, good boy; great value." "They take rum birds, ought take chest." "Not takes much room," replied woman. "You cannot expect it. The wishes one person must give way wishes many." "Why would starved me," replied I, angrily. "That is true, boy," replied mate; "but learn yet, might right; recollect morning made great favourite them." "What that?" inquired companion. "Only he nearly drove his knife one men, that is all," replied mate; "English sailors ar'n't fond knives." He touched his hat, went pool, desiring follow kid share supper. I so, return she asked I drawn knife upon seaman, I narrated occurred. She pointed impropriety I done, asking whether Bible tell us forgive injuries. "Yes," replied I; "but injuries ourselves? I forgive Jackson; prevent his hurting another." "Another! talk Nero animal rational being, his life much consequence fellow-creature. I mean say man wrong, must felt angry animal fond killed; great difference life animal fellow-creature. The animal dies, end it; man immortal soul, never perishes, nothing excuse taking life man, except self-defence. Does commandment say, 'Thou shalt kill?'" She talked long upon subject, fully made understand I wrong, I confessed I so. Chapter XXII I resolved speak her relative belt contained diamonds; I first obliged narrate her words Jackson told me. She heard great interest, asking question. When I told her all, I said-- "Now, talk taking chest, shall I do? Shall I wear belt myself, shall I put bundle? wear me, mother would done, she alive?" She reply time, last she said, talking herself, me-- "How unsearchable thy ways, O God!" Indeed, although I feel time, I afterwards thought, she told herself, great her surprise finding unshorn little Savage, thus living alone upon desolate rock, lad good birth, although he know it, fortune his charge, would, probability, ultimately his own. This certain, interest she felt towards increased every hour, degrees I disclosed history. "Well," replied she, "if trust me, I take charge belt. To-morrow select chest best take you, arrange wish." After hour's conversation, she went cabin, retired behind screen fixed up, telling she mind Nero, I might go bed I pleased. As I much inclined go seamen, I followed her advice went bed; I could sleep long time noise men made, carousing bathing-pool. The idea parting Nero also lay heavy upon heart, though woman almost satisfied soon I gone, animal would resume natural habits, care nothing me. I next morning early, went Nero obtain fish required. I left rocks seamen's breakfast (for sound asleep), returned cabin, prepared own. Mrs Reichardt, I shall call her, soon came me, breakfast over, proposed plant remainder potatoes packed things chest. As soon cut, set ravine, finished task noon, time seamen stirring, remained long night before, drinking. The mate one legs, he asked I thought smooth water launch boat following day. I replied affirmative, went Mrs Reichardt cabin, putting shovel, I hauled chest platform select articles I take. While thus employed, talking times, men came dried birds take ready putting boat following day, two trips cleared whole them. "Have used potatoes brought up?" said one men; "for shall short provisions." Mrs Reichardt replied none left. "Well then," said man, "the mate says better bring brute catch rest fish pond, may cook start, make two days' meals least." "Very well," replied I; "I come directly." I so, Nero, quarter hour, landed fish, I returned cabin. Mrs R. selected best clothes, made tight bundle, she sewed strong thread. My books she left out, well spy-glass, tools I had, might useful. I asked her whether I carry bathing-pool, she replied morning embarked would quite time enough. I went hole Jackson's bed-place, brought belt articles it. Mrs R., examined them, said she would take care all; watch trinkets she put her basket, belt she took bed-place, secreted it. She appeared silent thoughtful, asking her whether I take shovel, pail, hammer, she replied, "No, leave till ready go boat. It time enough." Shortly afterwards, mate brought us fish cooked supper, eaten went bed. "This last night shall sleep together, Nero," said I, kissing favourite, thought brought tears eyes. "But cannot helped." I however soon fast asleep arm round animal. When I went next morning, I found weather beautifully fine, water smooth, rippled light breeze. As Mrs R. yet made her appearance, I went bathing-pool, I found men full activity. The boat emptied out, oars, masts, sails, rocks men turning bows seaward readiness launching her ledge rocks. The dried birds lay heap side cask rum, fish baked large kid. The six breakers also piled together, mate men disputing many filled water. The mate wanted filled; men said three would sufficient, boat would loaded. At last mate gained his point, men took breaker, went cabin water. I went fill breakers, also see mischief, appeared unruly temper; I afraid would hurt Nero, cabin, I prevent them; exception examining cabin, forcing upon Mrs Reichardt, nothing. When breakers full, took least half hour, indeed try catch birds, would wrung necks, males flew away, females I put bed-place screened cabin, near Mrs Reichardt sitting. They appeared great awe respect woman, look her effectual words mate. "We do not want you," said one men, went bathing-pool breakers shoulders. "Why do not keep lady? You are quite lady's man, you have white trousers on." The others followed laughed latter remark. "I am use there, present," said I; "and I may below." The men set breakers rocks pool, then, directions mate, prepared launch boat ledge. The masts boat placed athwartships, her keel, her run upon, quite empty, she light. She call whale-boat, fitted whale fishery, pointed ends, steered oar; she large, held seven people comfortably, she remarkably well fitted sails masts, two lugs mizen. As soon ready, men went side boat, minute she launched sea without injury. The mate said me, brought her broadside ledge-- "Now, lad, do not want more; may go cabin till ready, send lady." "Oh! I use here," replied I; "and I none there." The mate reply, men went rum cask, rolled towards boat; ledge, parbuckled it, term it, boat whale-line happened have, great length. After cask rum got amidships, (and took great deal space, reaching one gunnel other, standing high thwarts) went breakers water, put in, three three behind cask, upon floor boat. "She heavy," said one men, "with much water." "We easily get rid it," replied mate. "If said she would heavy much liquor board, better explained matter; however, must ways, I suppose." The next articles brought stow away provisions. The kid fish put amidships breakers, dried birds, carried arms, packed neatly stern-sheets. They soon gunnel, mate said, "You better stow away forward now--there little room lady is." "No, no, stow aft," replied one men, surly tone; "the lady must sit she can. She is better we." "Shall go in?" said I, pointing coil whale-line, addressing mate. "No, no; must leave that," replied one men boat; "we shall wedged enough is; I say, Jim, throw old saw bag nails boat--we use them." The masts stepped, rigging set gunnel boat, yards sails handed in, hooked halyards ready hoisting. In fact boat ready starting; iron kettle two three articles put in. "Shall mizen?" inquired one men, pointing mast, lay rocks. "No, she steers quite well without it," replied mate. "We will leave it. And now, lads, hand oars in." They brought boat, owing puncheon rum centre, could lie flat, good deal arguing disputing, four oars boat-hook lashed gunnel outside, rest left rocks. At time consultation mate men--the mate evidently opposed others. I could hear about, mate appeared angry much annoyed. At last he dashed his hat rocks great passion, saying, "No good come it. Mark words. No good ever ever will. Be so, many me; I tell again, good come it." The mate sat rocks himself, put his head his knees, covering his hands. The man he disputing went others boat, spoke low tone, looking round me, ascertain I within hearing. After minute two separated, one said me-- "Now, lad, we are ready. Go cabin bring bundle her basket, tell lady waiting her." "There is shovel," said I, "and boat's sail--must I bring down?" "Oh yes, bring down, also two three sealskins lady sit upon." Off I went errand, I delighted idea leaving island, patience almost exhausted time taken stowage boat. As I hastened path, I heard loud contention, mate's voice speaking angrily, I stopped short time listen, noise ceased, I went again. I found Nero platform, I stopped minute caress him. "Good bye, poor Nero, shall never see one another again," said I. "You must go back sea, catch fish yourself;" tears started eyes I gave animal farewell kiss. I went cabin, I found Mrs Reichardt sitting quietly. "They ready," said I, "and sent I bring boat's sail seal skins sit upon. I carry carry bundle. Have put belt on?" "Yes," replied she, "I quite ready. I carry bundle, books spy-glass, well basket; must pack close," added she, "and roll sail round yard, able carry it." We took sail down, got ready carrying, I rolled two best seal skins, tied piece fishing line, ready. I shouldered burden, Mrs Reichardt took articles, proposed, left cabin go path bathing-pool. "Good bye, Nero--good bye, birds--good bye, cabin--and good bye, garden," said I, I went along platform; done, ordered Nero back tremulous voice, I turned head direction bathing-pool. I stared screamed, dropping burden, I lifted hands amazement-- "Look!" cried I companion. "Look!" repeated I, breathless. She look, saw I did--the boat sail, half mile pool, staggering fresh breeze, carried her away rate seven eight miles hour. They left us--they deserted us. I cried out, like madman, "Stop! stop! stop!" then, seeing useless was, I dashed rock, minute two insensible. "Oh!" groaned I, last, I came senses. "Frank Henniker," said sweet firm voice. I opened eyes, saw Mrs Reichardt standing me. "It Heaven, must submit patiently," continued she. "But cruel, treacherous!" replied I, looking fast-receding boat. "I grant, cruel, treacherous, must leave judgment God. What expect way mercy shewn none? I tell candidly, I think better present forlorn state upon rock, boat. They taken seeds discord, recklessness, intemperance, attempt requires greatest prudence, calmness, unanimity, I fear little chance even rescued dangerous position. It opinion, I thought I first knew found cask, liquor would prove ruin, I say again, boat never arrive destination, perish miserably. It pleased God leave us here, depend upon it, decided best." "But," replied I, looking boat, "I tired here--I anxious get off--and left! And taken provisions, everything, even fish pool. We shall starve." "I hope not," replied she, "and I think not; must exert ourselves, trust Heaven." But I could heed her--my heart bursting. I sobbed, I sat hands covering face. "All gone!" cried I. "No one left I." "Yes," replied she, "one more." "Who?" cried I, looking up. "God!--who us always." Chapter XXIII I heard she said, head confused weigh words. I remained silent, I was. A seconds elapsed, she spoke again: "Frank Henniker, rise, listen me." "We shall starve," muttered I. As I said this, one male birds returned sea large fish, Mrs Reichardt took possession, she seen do, gannet flew away obtain more. Immediately afterwards, two birds returned fish, like way secured companion. "See unjust ungrateful are," observed she. "Here birds feeding us, ravens Elijah wilderness, time doubting goodness mercy God. There meal us provided already." "My head! head!" exclaimed I, "it bursting, heavy weight rolling it--I cannot see anything." And fact: excitement brought determination blood head, senses rapidly departing. Mrs Reichardt knelt side, perceiving I said case, went cabin brought cloth, she wetted water spring, laid across forehead temples. I remained motionless nearly senseless half hour, she continued apply fresh cold water cloth, degrees I recovered stupor. In meantime, weather fine water smooth, gannets continued return fish caught, almost taken companion, she collected dozen fish, half pound pound weight, she put away, birds seal might devour them. I still half dozing state, breathing cold nose Nero touched cheek, murmurings favourite roused up, I opened eyes. "I better now," said I Mrs Reichardt. "How kind been!" "Yes, better, still, must remain quiet. Do think could walk bed-place?" "I will try," replied I, her assistance I rose up; but, I afterwards gained feet, I fallen she supported me; but, assisted her, I gained bed sank again. She raised head higher, applied linen cloth cold water before. "Try now," said she, "if cannot go sleep. When awake again, I dinner ready you." I thanked her shut eyes. Nero crawled bed-place, hand upon his head, I fell asleep, remained till near sunset, I awoke little pain head, much refreshed. I found Mrs Reichardt side. "You better now," said she. "Can eat dinner? I must make friends Nero, he disputing right come near bedside, his teeth rather formidable. However, I gave inside fish I cleaned them, better friends already. There dinner." Mrs Reichardt placed fish, broiled embers, I ate heartily. "It kind you," said I, "to working me, I ought working you--but must again." "Only share work well," replied she; "but share I always shall do. I cannot idle, I strong enough great deal; talk to-morrow morning. You quite well time, I hope." "Oh! I feel well now," replied I, "only I weak." "You must put trust God, poor boy. Do ever pray him?" "Yes, I try little sometimes--but I do not know how. Jackson never taught that." "Then I will. Shall I pray us?" "Will God hear you? What said I forgot everything morning?" "I told another besides ourselves, good gracious God, always us always ready come assistance call upon him." "You told God lived beyond stars." "My poor boy, he God afar attend prayers! Such case. He us always spirit, listening prayers, reading every secret thought hearts." I silent time, thinking upon she told me; last I said-- "Then pray him." Mrs Reichardt knelt prayed clear fervent voice, without hesitation stop. She prayed protection support desolate condition, might supplied things needful sustenance, happy deliverance present position. She prayed might contented resigned please rescue us--that might put whole trust confidence him, submit without murmuring whatever might his will. She prayed health strength, increase faith gratitude towards his mercies. She thanked preserved left desolate rock, instead left boat seamen. (This surprised me.) And she prayed me, entreating she might humble instrument leading Heavenly Father, he would pleased pour upon his Holy Spirit, I might, faith Christ, accepted, become child God inheritor eternal bliss. There something novel beautiful her fervency prayer, tears came eyes, minute she finished, I said-- "I recollect, least, I think I do--for memory confused-that mother used kneel pray done. Oh, I wish I mother!" "My child," replied she, "promise good obedient son, I mother you." "Will you? Oh! kind you. Yes, I wish; I work day night necessary. I everything, mother." "I duty mother strictly," replied she; "so agreed upon. Now, better go sleep, can." "But I must first ask question. Why thank God seamen left us here, instead taking us them?" "Because boat overloaded was; men, liquor, would become careless desperate, submit control; therefore I think little chance ever arriving anywhere safe, perish miserably way another. This, I consider, probability, unless Almighty his mercy pleased come assistance, allow fall vessel soon departure." "Do think, then, God prevented going purpose might share fate?" "I do! God regulates everything. Had better us gone, he would permitted it; he willed otherwise, must bow his full faith, he orders everything best." "And say God give us ask prayers?" "Yes, pray fervently faith, ask name Jesus Christ; is, he grant pray for, good us, good us; ask anything, know asking proper not--but he does. We may ask would hurtful us, then, his love us, he denies it. For instance, suppose accustomed pray, must prayed God he would permit leave island boat, anxious go away; supposing boat lost, I imagine be, surely would kindness God, knew would lost, grant prayer. Is so?" "Yes, I see now, thank you; I go sleep--good-night." Chapter XXIV I awoke next morning quite recovered illness day before, cabin Mrs Reichardt, still remained behind screen she put I gone sleep. It beautiful morning, water smooth, merely rippled light breeze, sun shone bright. I felt well happy. I lighted fire broil fish breakfast, sufficiency left, got fishing-lines ready catch larger fish reinhabit pond bathing pool. Mrs Reichardt came cabin found playing Nero. "Good morning, dear mother," said I, I felt kindly towards her. "Good morning, dear boy," replied she. "Are quite well?" "Quite well; I got lines ready, I thinking birds come, must live fish altogether, take fine weather like this; must lose day." "Certainly not. As soon breakfasted, go fish. I fish well, I used it. We must work now; first go Bible, may read little." I so, she read chapter she prayed, I knelt her side; breakfasted, soon breakfasted, set bathing-pool. "Do know left anything behind them, Frank?" "Yes," replied I, "they left oars, I believe, long line shovel, hammer, boat's small sail, cabin." "Well, shall see soon," replied she, went path. When arrived bathing-pool, first thing met eyes made leap joy. "Oh! mother! mother! they have left iron pot; I long it; I lay awake morning, I thought I prayed anything, would iron pot. I tired dried birds, ate different boiled pot potatoes." "I equally glad, Frank, I like victuals uncooked; let us first see else thrown boat." "Why put shore three little casks water," said I; "they took board." "They so, I suppose, boat heavy, would part liquor. Foolish men, six days' water, suffer dreadfully." We looked round rocks found left iron kettle, three breakers, five oars, harpoon staffs; gang-board, whale line 200 fathoms, old saw, bag broad-headed nails, two large pieces sheet-iron. "That saw may useful us," said Mrs Reichardt, "especially files chest. Indeed, want them, may convert one-half saw knives." "Into knives! How?" "I shew you; pieces sheet-iron I could use again. You see sheet-iron put repair hole might made boat, thrown out, well hammer nails. I wonder John Gough permitting it." "I heard quarrelling I came yesterday fetch down; would mind he said." "No, left here," replied she; "John Gough good man allowed it, he could prevented it. That sheet-iron useful. Do know for? broil fish on, anything else. We must turn corners hammer. But must lose time, fish day long, think eating till supper time." Accordingly threw lines, fish taking bait freely, soon hauled dozen large fish, I put bathing-pool. "What use make long line left?" "A good many; best use make it, turn fishing-lines, require new ones." "But that, thick heavy?" "Yes, I show unlay it, make again. Recollect, Frank, I wife Missionary, followed husband wherever he went; sometimes well off, sometimes badly I now--for Missionary go great dangers, great hardships, would acknowledge ever heard life, rather husband." "Will not tell me?" "Yes, perhaps I will, day another; I wish point is, his wife, sharing his danger privation, I often obliged work hard obtain living I could. In England, women little except house, Missionary's wife obliged work men, man often, therefore learns many things women general ignorant. You understand now?" "Oh yes. I thought already appear know Jackson did." "I think not; Jackson fond work I expect, I am. And now, Frank, little thought tardily went work day plant potatoes benefit one might hereafter come island, planting yourself, would reap benefit kind act; assisted, course I could done myself: true is, even world often rewarded good action." "But always?" "No, child, must expect that; rewarded world, rewarded next." "I do not understand that." "I suppose hardly can, I explain you, God spare life; must seasonable time." We continued fishing till late afternoon, time taken twenty-eight large fish, seven nine pounds' weight; Mrs Reichardt proposed leave off, already provision fortnight. I hauled one fish, she took her cook supper, coiled lines, I commenced, she told do, carrying articles left boat's crew bathing-pool. The first thing I seized upon coveted iron kettle; I quite overjoyed possession article, I good reason be. In hand I carried saw bag nails. As soon I deposited cabin, I went again, supper ready I brought everything except three breakers water, I left were, want present use, whatever might hereafter. We rather tired, glad go bed taken supper. Chapter XXV When met following morning, mother, I shall future call her, said me, "This busy day, Frank, great many arrangements make cabin, may comfortable. In future cabin must kept much clean tidy is--but business yours. Let us get breakfasts, begin." "I do not know want do," replied I; "but I I can, soon tell me." "My dear boy, woman requires portion cabin herself, custom women live altogether men. Now, I wish is, hinder part cabin, used stow away dried birds, made me. We oars make division, nail seal skins, I may part cabin myself. Now, understand I want?" "Yes, oars longer cabin wide," observed I. "How shall manage it?" "We old saw, well enough cut off, without sharpened." "I never saw one used," replied I, "and I do not understand it." "I soon show you. First, must measure width cabin. I shall take away one third it." My mother went cabin, I followed her. With piece fishing-line, she took width cabin, height rafters door posts. We went out, saw, she showed use, astonished much, I perceived effects, oars cut proper length. Gimlets I already sea-chest, nails hammer obtained boat, forenoon over, framework ready nailing seal skins. The bag broad-headed short nails, thrown rocks, excellent purpose, and, I plenty skins, cabin soon divided off, skin door-jambs hanging loose, one might enter. I went inside complete. "But," said I, "you light see about." "Not yet, I soon have," replied mother. "Bring saw here, Frank. Observe, must cut side cabin here, square hole size; three planks cut sufficient. Begin here." I she directed me, course half hour, I cut south side cabin window two feet square, admitted plenty light. "But will not make cold night?" said I. "We prevent that," replied she, she took piece white linen, broad-headed nails, she nailed up, prevent air coming in, although still plenty light. "There," said she, "that coarse job, I mend bye-and-bye, present." "Well, nice comfortable now," said I, looking round it. "Now shall I bring in?" "Nothing bed seal skins," said she. "I like feathers. The seal skins stiff present, I think may able soften bye-and-bye. Now, Frank, chest better come here, use is, make storeroom it, hold valuables." "What, diamonds?" replied I. "My dear boy, articles put chest, which, present position, valuable us diamonds world. Tell now, yourself, prefer set value upon, belt diamonds, iron kettle?" "The iron kettle, sure," replied I. "Exactly so; many things possession valuable iron kettle, hereafter acknowledge. Now go get ready fire us, I finish myself. Nero, keep out, sir--you never come cabin." I went Nero fish I returned, I determined I would use iron kettle. I put water boiled fish, I thought ate better broiled embers, made dry. As sat meal, I said, "Dear mother, next?" "To-morrow morning put cabin better order, put away things instead leaving platform way. Then I carefully look got, put away chest. I yet seen contents chest." The next day cloudy and, rough weather, blowing fresh. After breakfast set work. We cleared floor cabin, strewed manner things, Jackson I particular. The whale line coiled put one corner, every thing else brought place found it. "We must contrive shelves," said mother, "that may put things them, else never tidy; one except holds books. I think manage it. We two oars left besides boat's yard; nail along side cabin, foot it, cut boat's sail, nail canvas side cabin oars, make sort shelf hold things." I brought oars, measured cut nailed up. The canvas stretched side cabin oar, nailed broad-headed nails, made two capital shelves side cabin, running one end other. "There," said mother, "that good job. Now examine chest put everything away place." My mother took clothes, folded up. When she found roll duck bottom, she said-- "I glad find I make dress much better island black stuff dress I wear, I put wear case taken island days, I must dress like people I among them. The clothes sufficient last long while, I shall alter two shirts two pair trousers present size, grow fast. How old think now?" I replied, "About sixteen years old, perhaps more." "I think age." Having examined folded every article clothing chest, tools, spyglass, &c., put shelves, examined box containing thread, needles, fishhooks, articles, buttons, &c. "These valuable," said she; "I put along them. Go fetch basket, I yet time look since I left ship." "What it?" "Except brushes combs, I hardly say. When I travelled about, I always carried basket, containing things requisite daily use, basket I put everything I wished preserve, till I opportunity put away. When I embarked board whaler, I brought basket arm usual, except opening brushes combs scissors, I examined months." "What brushes combs scissors?" "That I shew you," replied she, opening lid basket. "These brushes combs cleaning hair, scissors. Now take everything out." The basket indeed appear contain wonderful quantity things, almost new me. There two brushes, twelve combs, three pair scissors, penknife, little bottle ink, pens, woman's thimble, piece wax, case needles, thread silk, piece India ink, camel's-hair brush, sealing-wax, sticking plaster, box pills, tape bobbin, paper pins, magnifying glass, silver pencil case, money purse, black shoe ribbon, many articles I forgotten. All I know I never much interested ever show I contents basket, explained mother, uses, made. There several little papers bottom basket she said seeds plants, she collected take England her, would plant here. As she shook dust basket empty, two three white things tumbled out, she asked pick give her. "I do not know came here," said she, "but three orange-pips sow to-morrow, pea, kind I know not, sow also--but I fear come up, appears one peas served sailors board ship, old grow. We try. Now put chest, things have, want present use, I drive nail side bedroom hang basket it." "But," said I, "this round glass--what for?" "Put one side," replied she, "and to-morrow, fine, I shew use it; things forgotten, belt articles gave take thought leave island. They bed-place opposite yours." I brought them, she put away mate's watch sleeve buttons, trinkets, &c., saying she would examine letters papers another time. The belt examined, counting many squares stones them, then, her scissors, she cut open one squares, took white glittering thing like glass appeared me, looked carefully. "I great judge things," said she, "but still I picked little knowledge. This belt, contain stones like this, must considerable value; I must get needle thread sew again." She did, put belt away articles chest. "And now," said she, "we done good day's work, time something eat." Chapter XXVI I must say I much better pleased appearance cabin, neat clean been, everything way. The next day calm clear day, went fish. We fortunate, procured almost many done previous fishing--they put bathing pool before. When went cabin, soon fish put fire, direction mother, I turned sides one pieces sheet iron, make sort dish. The piece I to, high sides, one piece kept baking fish dish put dinner upon cooked. That day busy fishing think anything else, following I recollected magnifying glass, brought her. She first showed power magnify, I much amused time, she explained well she could power, I could well understand her; I pleased effect cognisant because. Afterwards she sent cabin dried moss I used tinder, placing glass concentrate rays sun, astonishment I saw tinder caught fire. It amazement astonishment, I looked see fire came from. My mother explained me, I, certain degree, comprehended, I anxious glass hands try experiments. I lighted tinder again-then I burnt hand--then I singed one gannet's heads, lastly, perceiving Nero fast asleep sun, I obtained focus his cold nose. He started growl, made retreat, I perfectly satisfied result experiments. From time, fire was, sun shone, invariably lighted burning-glass, useful I find it. As portable, I always carried me, I nothing do, I magnified, set fire, according humour moment. Although I mentioned it, morning rose, breakfast, I read Scriptures mother. "There is much book I cannot understand," said I, one morning. "I suspect that, living have, alone island, seen nothing world," replied mother, "that many books would understand." "But I understand said Beast Bird Book," replied I. "Perhaps may, think do; but, Frank, must class Bible books. The books works man, Bible word God. There many portions book cleverest men, devoted lives study, cannot understand, never understood long world endures. In many parts Bible sealed book." "But never understood anybody?" "There quite much Bible necessary men follow precepts, clear anybody may understand it--it contains necessary salvation; passages, true meaning cannot explain, God, his purposes, permit us to. But know now, shall probably hereafter, left world, intellects nearly approach God's." "Well, I do not understand understand it." "Frank," replied she, "look flower bloom. Do understand plant keeps alive--grows every year--every year throws large blue flower? Why so? flower always blue? whence comes beautiful colour? Can tell me? You see, know so; tell makes so?" "No." "Look bird. You know hatched egg. How inside egg changed bird? How bird covered feathers, power fly? Can explain yourself? You walk please--you power reasoning, thinking, acting; means possess power? Can tell? You know so, know more. You cannot tell causes produce effects--can you?" "No." "Well, then, surrounded manner things, living dead, see every day things cannot explain, understand, surprised that, God let know means effects produced, his written word he also keep good purposes permitted know. Everything God's will, must sufficient us. Now understand?" "Yes, I see mean, I never thought things before. Tell Bible." "Not now. Some day I give history Bible, understand nature book, written; present. Suppose, nothing particular do, tell know Jackson, happened lived him. I heard part, I like know all." "Very well," replied I. "I tell everything, take long while." "We shall plenty time spare, dear boy, I fear, leave place; so, never mind time--tell everything." I commenced narrative, I interrupted. "Have never able call mother memory?" said she. "I think I now, since I seen you, I could before. I recollect person dressed like you, kneeling praying side; I said before, figure appeared dreams, much oftener since here." "And father?" "I slightest remembrance him, anybody else except mother." I proceeded, continued narrative time go bed; I circumstantial, often interrupted questions, I told quarter I say. Chapter XXVII Mrs Reichardt promised give history Bible; one day, weather kept us home, she thus commenced her narrative:-- "The Bible history God's doings salvation man. It commences fall man disobedience, ends sacrifice made his reinstatement. As one man, Adam, sin came world, one man, Jesus Christ, sin death overcome. If refer third chapter Genesis, commencement Bible, find time Adam receives his punishment, promise made Lord, head serpent shall hereafter bruised. The whole Bible, commencement, announcement coming Christ; soon fault committed, Almighty, his mercy, provided remedy. Nothing unknown unforeseen God. "Recollect, Frank, Bible contains history God's doings, often tell us things done. It must sufficient us know God; he thinks proper, he allows us understand his ways, limited capacities, his doings inscrutable. But, suppose that, we, foolishness, cannot comprehend his reasons, therefore must cavilled at? Do understand me, Frank?" "Yes," replied I; "I pretty well." "As I pointed day, see blade grass grow, see flower, know not. If surrounded life innumerable things see cannot comprehend--when nature mystery you--even yourself--how expect understand dealings God things? When, therefore, read Bible, must read faith." "What faith? I do not quite understand, mother." "Frank, I often told many things England, one day hope go. Now, arrive England, find everything I told quite true, satisfied I worthy belief." "Yes." "Well, suppose one tell something relative country, could understand, came asked case, would you, found I told truth regard England, believe told country true, I positively asserted so?" "Of course I should, mother." "Well, then, Frank, would faith; belief things seen, cannot understand. But go on, I mention people presumptuous ask wherefore God's doings, attempt argue upon justice, forgetting little reason gift God, must endowed intellect equal Almighty, enable know perceive he decides upon. But God permitted us understand his ways, still, wherever trace finger God, always perceive everything directed all-wise beneficent hand; that, although causes appear simple, effects produced extraordinary wonderful. We shall observe talk history Jews, Bible. But, I repeat, must study whole Bible faith, continually asking ourselves, 'Why done?' If turn ninth chapter Epistle Romans, see Apostle Paul says subject: 'Nay but, O man, art thou repliest God?' Shall thing formed say formed it, 'Why hast thou made thus?' Do understand spirit Bible read?" "Yes, I do. We must read Word God, believe read it." "Exactly;--now proceed. After Adam's fall, earth became wicked God destroyed it, leaving Noah his family re-people it; soon done, Almighty prepared his original intention future salvation men. He selected Abraham, good man, faith, father nation chosen his people--that Jewish nation. He told his seed multiply stars heavens, nations earth blessed him; is, his descendants Christ born, salvation men. Abraham's great-grandchildren brought Egypt, live apart land Goshen. You read history Joseph his brethren?" "Oh yes; I know well." "Well, Almighty wished Jews nation apart others, purpose he brought Egypt. But observe, Frank, simple natural causes effected. It dream Joseph's, which, he told it, irritated his brothers him; sold slave, he sent Egypt. There, explained dream Pharaoh, he made ruler Egypt, saved country famine every land. His brothers come buy corn, he recognises them. He sends his father family, establishes land Goshen, shepherds, apart Egyptians. Here multiplied fast; Joseph's elevation cruelly treated Egyptians, became afraid rapid increase, eventually Kings Egypt gave orders male children Jews destroyed. It time, oppressed cruelly treated Egyptians, God interfered sent Moses. Moses, like rest Jews, knew nothing true God, difficult persuade, miracles he convinced." "Why God keep Jews apart Egyptians, thrown bondage?" "Because he wished prepare become his peculiar people. By descended Abraham, never intermarried nations, become pure race; bondage severely treated, suffered become united people. They knew Gods worshipped Egyptians, Gods intention Almighty confound, prove Jews worthless. At time he worked his nation mystery, Moses asked God he tell his people he was, Almighty replied words--_I am_; name like false Gods worshipped Egyptians. He prove, his wonderful miracles, difference false Gods." "What miracles?" "A miracle man power doing, proving party superior man: instance--to restore dead man life miracle, none God, empowered God could do. Miracles necessary, therefore, prove Jews Almighty true God, resorted instance, well coming Our Saviour, also necessary prove he Son God. When Almighty sent Moses Pharaoh demand Israelites permission sacrifice desert, he purposely hardened heart Pharaoh he might refuse request." "But he so?" "Because he wanted prove Israelites he true God Pharaoh consented going away, would opportunity performing miracles Israelites delivered, acknowledge God." Mrs Reichardt often renewed conversation, till I became acquainted Scriptural History. Chapter XXVIII The following morning, I went Nero take couple fish pool. As soon Nero caught them, he went part bathing pool amuse himself, I cleaned fish, I generally I went cabin, giving heads insides his share, I require portion birds. Nero full play morning, I threw heads him, he frolicked water, he brought rocks, instead eating them, usual, he laid feet. I threw several times, he continued bring out, mother, coming me, watching him. "I think," said she, "you must teach Nero fetch carry like dog--try. Instead heads, throw piece wood;" she broke boat-hook staff. I so, Nero brought out, he done heads fish. I patted coaxed animal, tried several times success. "Now," said mother, "you must accustom certain words send anything. Always say, 'Fetch it, Nero!' point finger." "Why I that, mother?" I asked. "Because object gained is, animal fetch throw in, send bring thrown in. Do understand?" "Yes," replied I. "You mean anything floating near sea, I send it." "Exactly. Then Nero would use." "I soon teach him," replied I; "to-morrow I send sea piece spar. I have fear he go away now." "I thinking last night, Frank, whether taken pail boat." "The pail," said I; "I know is, I quite forgot it. We left ravine last day planted potatoes." "We so, I recollect. I go get breakfast ready." We many weeks fish diet, I must confess I tired it, case I lived upon dried birds whole year. Why I cannot tell, I soon learn relish fish, I could obtain them. It often wind blew direct shore, coming northward eastward, slanting direction, occasionally, chiefly time Equinoxes, gales came heavy eastward, wash seas upon rocky coast tremendous. Such case time. A fierce gale wind eastward raised sea threw surf spray high loftiest rocks, violence wind bore spray far inland. The gale come evening, mother I, rose morning, standing platform cabin, admiring grandeur scene, without least idea productive much misery ourselves. My mother pointed passages Psalms Old Testament bearing strongly upon scene us; time I called Nero, went take fish pool day's consumption. At time large supply pool--more ever, I say. When I arrived pool, I found waves several feet height rolling ledges, pool one mass foam, water least two three feet higher usual; still never occurred mischief done, I sent Nero fish, found that, floundering diving time, he bring one. My mind misgave me, I ordered again. He remained time returned without fish, I satisfied rolling waves, unusual quantity water pool, whole fish escaped, without provisions means subsistence, weather settle, enable us catch more. Aghast discovery, I ran cabin, called mother, her bedroom. "Oh, mother, fish got pool, nothing eat. I told starved." "Take time, Frank, take breath," replied she, "and tell happened, alarm dismay, appear in." I explained her happened, Nero could find one fish. "I fear say must correct," replied she; "but must put trust God. It his will, whatever he wills must right." I cannot say I Christian enough time acknowledge truth her reply, I answered, "If God good gracious say, he allow us starve? Does he know starving?" continued I. "Does he know, Frank?" replied mother; "what Bible say--that sparrow falls ground without his knowledge; much worth many sparrows? Shame upon you, Frank!" I abashed satisfied, I therefore replied quietly, "We nothing eat, mother." "Granted lost fish, Frank, still yet starving; weather may moderate tomorrow, may catch more, even till day afterwards, bear two days without food. Let us hope best put trust God--let us pray ask his assistance. He rebuke stormy waters--he always find means helping put confidence him, send us aid hope appears gone. Pray, Frank, I do, fervently, believing prayer heard--pray faith, prayer answered." "It always so," replied I; "you told many people died starvation." "I grant it, wise purposes permitted do, Almighty reasons permitting it, unknown us, may depend upon it, good. We cannot fathom his decrees. He may even decide fate; so, depend upon it, Frank, right, appears cruel neglectful you, would, future could looked us, prove act mercy." "Do think, then, shall starve?" "I not--I much faith God's mercy, I think he would preserved lives preventing men taking us boat, starve. God inconsistent; I feel assured that, forlorn present position appears be, tried faith may be, shall still preserved, live monuments his gracious love kindness." These words mother implicit confidence she appeared have, much revived me. "Well," said I, "I hope right, dear mother, I think it," continued I, brightening idea, "if worst come worst, eat birds; I do not care much now, I did, starve, mother." "I believe would hesitate sacrifice birds, Frank, greater sacrifice may demanded you." "What?" inquired I; little thought, I said, "You do not mean Nero, mother?" "To tell truth, I mean Nero, Frank, birds support day two." "I never could kill Nero, mother," replied I gloomily, walking away cabin, I sat melancholy idea favourite sacrificed; appeared quite horrible, mother referred it, made her fall much good opinion. Alas! I indeed young foolish, little thought change would take place feelings. As birds, I really care them, I resolved kill two day's meal, returning platform I laid hold two seized neck, mother asked I going do. "Kill them, put pot dinner," replied I. "Nay, Frank! hasty. Let us make little sacrifice, even poor birds. We surely fast one day without great suffering. To-morrow time enough." I dropped birds hand, tacitly consenting her proposal. It not, however, sake birds I so, one day's respite birds would day's respite Nero. "Come," said mother, "let us go cabin get work. I alter clothes you. What do?" "I do not know," replied I, "but I whatever tell me." "Well, then, I perceive two fishing-lines much worn, may break soon, shall without means taking fish, even weather fine, cut whale line, unravelled, I show lay fishing line; and, perhaps, instead altering clothes, I better help you, fishing-lines consequence us anything else." This arrangement I gladly consented to. In short time whale line unravelled, mother showed lay three yarns, make stout fishing line. She assisted, time passed away rapidly I expected would. "You clever, mother," said I. "No, child, I not, I certainly know many things women general acquainted with; reason is, I lived life wandering, occasional hardships. Often left resources, husband I among strangers, found necessity learning many things ourselves, money usually employ others them; I situations even money use, trust entirely myself. I therefore always made rule learn everything I could; I passed much life sailing deep waters, I obtained much useful knowledge seamen, laying fishing lines one arts communicated me. Now, see, I reap advantage it." "Yes," replied I; "and I. How lucky came island!" "Lucky me, mean, Frank?" "No, mother! I mean lucky me." "I trust I sent useful, Frank, feeling I cheerfully submit God. He sent I may useful you, I doubt; means drawn towards him, and, eventually, become one his children, I shall fulfilled mission." "I understand quite, mother." "No, cannot yet, everything season," replied she, slowly musing; "'First blade, ear, full corn ear.'" "Mother," said I, "I like hear whole story life. You know I told I know myself. Now suppose tell history, husband. You say perhaps, one day would. Do recollect?" "Yes, I recollect I make sort promise, Frank, I promise day I fulfil it; I sure understand profit history now, much may bye-and-bye." "Well, mother, tell story twice, I shall glad hear again, tell now, amuse me, bye-and-bye I may profit it." My mother smiled, she seldom did, said-- "Well, Frank, I know would time give dinner listen story, dinner to-day, I think fair I consent wish. Who shall I begin with--with husband myself?" "Pray begin history," replied I. Chapter XXIX "I daughter parish clerk small market town near southern coast England, within miles large seaport." "What parish clerk?" I asked, interrupting mother commencement her promised narrative. "A parish clerk," she replied, "is man employed parish place he belongs, fulfil certain humble duties connection church place worship people meet together worship God." "What he there?" I inquired. "He gives psalms sung, leads congregation making responses minister appointed perform services church; custody registry births, deaths, burials inhabitants, care church monuments, property belonging building. In places he also fulfils duties bell-ringer grave-digger; say, ringing large bell top church, he summons people devotions, lives, digs hole consecrated ground, surrounding sacred building, receive bodies dead." I mused strange combination offices, entertained notion importance functionary, I afterwards found completely variance real state case. "My father," she resumed, "not fulfilled duties, contrived perform functions schoolmaster parish children." "What parish children?" I asked eagerly. "I know children are, Jackson represented I child father mother, makes children, parish children?" "They children poor," Mrs Reichardt replied, "who, able afford instruction, willingly allow taught expense people parish generally." I thought praiseworthy arrangement. I knew nothing poors-rates, system giving relief poor parish, long used England, afterwards explained me, kindness wisdom plan instruction became evident understanding. I proceeding ask questions, mother stopped saying, I expected her get her story, I must let her proceed without interruption; many things would mentioned her demanded explanation, one completely unaware existence myself, would impossible make thoroughly acquainted things within reasonable time; proper explanations, she promised, follow. She proceeded. "My father, may thought, enough his hands, obscure country town, unusual one man unite occupations several, particularly case father, who, addition offices I enumerated, best cattle-doctor bone-setter within ten miles; often earned his bread different kinds farmer's work, thatching, hedging, ditching like. Nevertheless, he found time read his Bible, bring his daughter religiously. This daughter myself." "What become mother?" I asked, I thought strange Mrs Reichardt mention one parent. "She died soon birth," she answered, "and I left first care poor woman, nursed me; soon, however, I could run about, exhibited signs intelligence, father began get partial me, he reluctantly allowed go his sight. He took great pains teaching he knew, though extent his acquirements means great, sufficient lay good foundation, establish desire comprehensive information, I sought every available means obtain. "I remember early age I exhibited extraordinary curiosity child; constantly asking questions, father, his friends visitors, and, seemed consider quick lively child, took pleasure satisfying inquisitive spirit. In way I gained great deal knowledge, and, observation passed around me, great deal more. "It soon became source pride gratification father, ask read Bible him. This naturally led good many inquiries part, numerous explanations his. In course time, I became familiar sacred writings, knew spirit meaning much better many persons double age. "My fondness studies, consequent reputation, attracted attention Dr Brightwell, clergyman parish, kindness let share instructions his children, still advanced education, still increased natural predilection religious information. By time I thirteen, I became quite prodigy Christian learning, often sent parsonage, astonish great people neighbourhood, facility I answered puzzling questions put me, respecting great mysteries Christianity." Chapter XXX It time I first became acquainted orphan boy, inmate workhouse, left care parish sudden death his parents, German clock-maker his wife, malignant fever visited neighbourhood, taken considerable portion labouring population. I sent errands father, master workhouse, severe, sullen man, I great dread, I noticed child, consequence his pale melancholy countenance, apparently miserable condition. I observed one took notice him; he allowed wander great straggling workhouse, among insane, idiotic, imbecile, without slightest attention paid his going coming; short, he lived wretched life workhouse boy. "I see eager ask workhouse boy," said mother, "so I anticipate question. There is, various parishes country belong, building expressly set apart accommodation support destitute disabled poor. It usually contains inmates ages, infant born, aged, whose infirmities shew verge grave. They known state helpless poverty, quite unable earn subsistence themselves. In building clothed fed; younger provided instruction necessary put way earning livelihood; elders community enjoying consolations religion, accorded regular visits chaplain." "I suppose," I observed, "that people lived there, deeply impressed good fortune finding asylum?" "As far I could ever ascertain," Mrs Reichardt replied, "it exactly reverse. It always thought degrading enter workhouse, industrious labourer would endure every privation rather live there. An honest hard-working man must sorely driven indeed, seek shelter his distress." "That seems strange," I observed. "Why he object receive he much stands need of?" "When he thus comes upon funds parish," answered mother, "he becomes called pauper, among English peasantry better sort, greatest possible aversion ranked degraded class. Consequently, inmates workhouses either whose infirmities prevent earning subsistence, idle dissolute, feel none honest prejudices self-dependence, care live day day coarse meagre fare afforded charity wealthier industrious fellow-creatures. "The case poor boy I thought pitiable. I found his name Heinrich Reichardt. He could speak language his own, therefore his wants remained unknown, his feelings unregarded. He brought certain sense comfort decency, cruelly outraged position he found placed sudden death his parents. I observed he often tears, his fair features light hair contrasted remarkably squalid faces matted locks his companions. His wretchedness never failed make deep impression me. "I brought little presents, strove express sympathy his sufferings. He seemed, first, surprised grateful, I shortly discovered attentions gave unusual pleasure, he looked upon visits his solace gratification. "Even period I exercised considerable influence father, I managed interest case poor foreign boy extent, he induced take workhouse, find home his roof. He first reluctant burden bringing child, who, his foreign language habits, could little use his avocations; I promised teach English, learning he stood need, assured father prodigious short time I would make much abler assistant he likely find among boys town. "My father's desire please me, rather faith he reposed assertions, led allow I pleased affair. I lost time, therefore, beginning course instruction, weeks ascertained I apt pupil, determined proceed his education fast circumstances would admit. We soon able express ideas other, months read together book I received many invaluable lessons. "In short time, I became less proud of, partial to, pupil. I took studies I pursued auspices clergyman, secretly pleased find, he singularly quick imbibing instructions, displayed strong natural taste investigations towards I shown marked bias. "Day day sat together discoursing great events recorded Holy Writ: going every chapter marvellous records, page page, till whole firmly fixed upon minds, necessity conversations referring Sacred Book. We found examples held imitation; found incidents regarded promises Divine protection; found consolation comfort, well exhortation advice; and, moreover, found sort instruction led us select duties apparently tended bring us nearer Great Being whose goodness diligently studied. "My father seemed much pleased successful teaching, he successful learning; young Reichardt turned remarkably handy intelligent lad, whose assistance his avocations he could recourse perfect confidence his cleverness discretion, he grew extremely partial him. Dr Brightwell also proved his friend, years, condition friendless workhouse boy changed, he could taken person. "He boy grateful spirit, always regarded devotion thankful heart. Often would he contrast wretchedness his previous condition, happiness he enjoyed, express warmest terms his obligations important service I rendered rescuing abject misery workhouse. Under circumstances, extraordinary, learn regard liveliest feelings affection, still children, endured transports torments make existence experienced lovers." "I like interrupting you," I observed, "but I certainly like know meant word lovers?" "I scarcely explain satisfactorily present," said Mrs Reichardt, smile; "but I doubt, many years passed head--always provided escape island--you understand without requiring explanation. But I must leave story, many things much consequence future welfare demand careful attention." I could ascertain her meant word whose meaning I asked. It much excited curiosity, she left attend her domestic duties, she extremely regardful, I opportunity time eliciting her explanation I desired. Chapter XXXI It impossible overrate value Mrs Reichardt's assistance. Indeed her, circumstanced I particular period, I probability perished. Her exhortations saved despair, position seemed grown quite desperate. But example more, even, precept. Her ingenuity devising expedients, her activity putting force, her unfailing cheerfulness disappointment, Christian resignation privation, produced best results. I enabled bear ill effects crippled resources, consequent upon ill conduct sailors whaler, failure fish-pond. She manufactured strong lines deep sea fishing, discovered shelf rock, little two feet sea, good deal difficulty I could descend, I took stand one day rock lines baited piece one feathered favourites, dire necessity last forced destroy. I waited patience veteran angler. I knew water deep, lay sheltered nook corner rocks ten feet across; I allowed line drop three four yards, float, could tell I bite feeling pull line, wound round arm. After time passed way, attention withdrawn line, given narrative I lately heard--that say, though eyes still fixed upon line, I completely given thoughts story poor German boy, snatched poverty interference parish clerk's daughter, I contrived speculate I done circumstances, imagining sorts extravagances I indulged, testify gratitude amiable benevolent friend. A singular course ideal scenes followed quick succession mind--as I fancied hero similar adventure. I regarded imaginary benefactress feelings intensity I never experienced; seemed I her exciting object sentiments like nature, knowledge awoke hearts agreeable sensations. I rudely disturbed day-dream finding suddenly plunged deep water beneath me. The shock startling, seconds elapsed I could comprehend situation; became clear I must hooked fish, succeeded pulling balance, line he held round arm, cutting painfully flesh, threatened drowning keeping water. With great difficulty I managed rise surface, loosened windings line limb; then, anxious retain possession force must fish well worth trouble catching, I held hands, pulled strength. At first, main force I drawn water; I found strain slacken, I drew line. This manoeuvre repeated several times, till I succeeded obtaining view I caught; or, properly speaking, caught me. It merely glimpse; fish, large one, getting sight within yards him, made desperate plunges, darted off, dragging along him, sometimes water, sometimes surface. His body nearly round, seven eight feet long--rather formidable antagonist close quarters; nevertheless, I eager get him, so, I ascertained his resistance evidently decreasing. I continued approach, last got near enough plunge knife haft his head, put end struggle. But another difficulty presented itself. In ardour chase I drawn nearly mile island, I found impossible carry back produce sport, exhausted I efforts I made capturing him. I knew I could swim burthen inconsiderable portion distance. My fish therefore must abandoned. Here bountiful supply food, soon placed within reach, rendered totally unavailable. I thought Mrs Reichardt. I thought gratified she would been, could I brought her excellent addition scanty stock food. Then I thought her steadfast reliance upon Providence, valuable lessons piety wisdom she would read me, she found depressed disappointment. Chapter XXXII As soon I could disconnect tackle dead fish, I turned face homewards, struck manfully shore; luckily I observe sharks. I landed safely without adventure, immediately sought kind friend companion, I found, usual, industriously employed endeavouring secure additional comforts. If she engaged ordinary women's work, making, mending, cleaning, improving, habitation, she sure found something immediate neighbourhood, which, though less feminine, shewed less forethought, prudence, sagacity. Our garden prospered wonderfully her hands. The ground seemed stocked various kinds vegetation, I neither knew value, proper mode cultivation; seemed surrounded shrubs plants--many pleasing appearance--that must short time entirely change aspect place. She heard adventure good deal interest, remonstrating upon want caution, dwelling upon fatal consequences must ensued herself, I drowned disabled falling rock, devoured sharks. "You may consider yourself, dear son," she observed, serious earnestness, "to Divine care. Nothing clearer wise kind Providence continually watching his creatures placed unusual perilous circumstances. He occasionally affords manifestations his favour, encourage engaged good works. This shews comprehensive eye master many workmen, overlooks labours his industrious servants, indicates his regard welfare appreciation labours." "But surely," I interposed, "if I superintendence Providence speak, I obliged abandon capital fish, I endured trouble capture it, possession necessary comfort, nay, even existence." "The abandonment unwieldy creature," she replied, "is unanswerable evidence Divine interposition favour; persisted intention carrying shore, little doubt weight would overpowered you, would drowned; would become me? A woman left desolate spot her resources, must soon forced give struggle existence, want physical strength. Nevertheless, numerous instances record, women surmounted hardships men could endure. Supported Heavenly Father, powerful protector weak, friend helpless, weakest weak sex may triumph intolerable sufferings. I, however, confident supported, therefore, I think would shewing proper consideration fellow exile, act every emergency much circumspection prudence possible." I promised future I would run risks, added many professions regard her safety. They desired effect; I pretended think disappointment, nevertheless, I found constantly dwelling size lost fish, lamenting obliged abandon his voracious brethren deep. These thoughts filled mind night I continued dream whole incident, beginning patient angling rock, concluding disconsolate swim shore--and pursued scaly antagonist quite determinedly sleep I done deep waters. I rose early passed disturbed night, soon made way usual haunt Nero, I discovered sea near rocks making sorts strange tumblings divings, apparently dark object floating water. I called away, examine attracted his attention, surprise may imagined I made huge form enemy preceding day. My shouts exclamations joy soon brought Mrs Reichardt scene, she discovered shape prodigious fish, her surprise seemed scarcely less own. How land first consideration; debate ways means, I got rope leaped water it, fastened noose round his gills, swimming back climbing rock; jointly tried pull shore. We hauled tugged force considerable time, little effect; he heavy pull perpendicularly. At last managed drag low piece rock, I divided several pieces, Mrs Reichardt carried away dry preserve way she said would make fish capital eating year round. It palatable dressed her, she changed manner cooking several times, I never got tired it. By flavour, far I could judge subsequent knowledge, creature something sturgeon kind fish, proper name I never could learn; I ever able catch another, therefore, I must presume stranger seas. Nevertheless, he proved acceptable us both, fared ill time, his providential capture. It one afternoon, enjoying capital meal expense great friend, I led subject Mrs Reichardt's adventures, subsequently she broke story herself poor German boy; though without considerable reluctance, I induced her proceed her narrative. Chapter XXXIII "Our good minister Dr Brightwell," she commenced, "was man considerable scholastic attainments, he delighted making display them. At one time, he master extensive grammar school, he employed good deal his leisure teaching boys girls town, indicated possession anything like talent. The overseers used talk jestingly father Doctor teaching plough-boys Greek Latin; wenches, whose chief employment stone-picking fields, geography use globes. Even churchwardens shook heads, privately thought Rector little his seven senses wasting his learning upon unprofitable scholars. Nevertheless, he continued his self-imposed task, without meeting reward beyond satisfaction his conscience. It till he added his pupils young Reichardt, he felt he his duty prospect advantage. "The spirit emulation roused us make extraordinary efforts second worthy master's endeavours: not, usually case, proceed rivalry--it arose entirely desire one stand well estimation other. In way learned French Latin languages, geography, usual branches superior education: bias particularly religious knowledge, preceptor encouraged this, till almost good theologians himself. "While information carefully arranged digested, sprung hearts deep devotion other, miserable absent enjoyed gratification much other's society. We knew full power meaning preference, but, changed boy girl-hood adult life, feelings developed attachment sexes, time immemorial received name love." "I think I know means, now," said I, day-dream, rudely disturbed fall sea occurred me. "It would strange did," she replied, "considering quite impossible become acquainted it." "Yes, I certain I understand well," I rejoined, confidently, added, without embarrassment, "If I placed position Heinrich Reichardt, I quite sure I feel towards young female, kind me, deepest regard affection. I like constantly near her, always desire she like better anyone else." "That quite good explanation matter, I could expect you," she observed, smiling. "But return story. Our mutual attachment attracted general attention, subject much observation. But enemies: met strolling together shady lanes, gathering wild flowers, wandering woods search wild strawberries, one thought necessary make remark arms round other's waist. My father, he heard anything it, interfere. Young Reichardt made useful him, shewed remarkably clever everything he undertook, old man loved his son. "It settled thing us, become man wife, soon permitted. And many plans schemes future. Heinrich considered position Jacob, served long patient apprenticeship Rachel; though he confessed he like wait long his wife patriarch made do, he acknowledged he would rather serve father full period, give hope possessing me. "This happy state things was, however, suddenly put end to, Dr Brightwell one day sending father. It long time he came back, he did, he looked unusually grave reserved. In hour he communicated result his long interview Rector. The Doctor resolved send young Reichardt distant place, many learned men lived together colleges, purpose advancing his education, fitting religious teacher, vocation he long expressed desire devote himself. The idea separation seemed terrible, I last got reconciled it, belief would greatly Heinrich's advantage, parted last many tears, many protestations, fears, great many hopes. "For days he left me, everything seemed strange, every one seemed dull, every place seemed desolate, I felt I transported dismal scene, I knew one, one likely care slightest degree. My father went his avocations different spirit he long used exhibit; evident he missed Heinrich much I did, villagers stared whenever I passed them--as though ever going without Heinrich, something never anticipated. "In course time, however, appearance, everything every one went daily course, though Heinrich ever heard of. My father would sometimes, overpressed business, refer able assistant he lost, I heard conjecture hazarded one his confidential friends, young Reichardt himself. My conjectures, references him, far occasional; scarce hour day I think him; but, believing I please endeavouring improve much possible his absence, I give idle reflections respecting past, anticipations, equally idle, respecting future. "My great delight hearing him. At first, his letters expressed his feelings me; he dwelt largely his exertions preparing profession he desired adopt; time, his correspondence almost entirely composed expositions his views religious life, dissertations various points doctrine. He evidently growing enthusiastic religion, less regardful attachment. "Yet I entertained apprehensions misgivings. I think necessary consider slighted thoughts future husband evidently raised me; knowledge made anxious raise towards elevation his thoughts intently directed. "Things went way two three years. I never saw time; I heard seldom. He excused his limited correspondence plea his studies left time writing. I never blamed apparent neglect--indeed I rather encouraged it, exhortations always he address his time energies towards attainment object I knew much heart--his becoming minister Lord's Gospel. "One day father came home rectory troubled countenance. Dr Brightwell indignant Heinrich joined religious community dissented Articles Church England. The Doctor offered get employment Church, he would give his new connections: earnest character his new faith exerted much influence his enthusiastic nature, he willingly abandoned his bright prospects become humble labourer less productive vineyard. "My father, clerk parish, seemed think bound share indignation his pastor desertion, Heinrich severely condemned displaying ingratitude his benefactor: I commanded think him. "This, however, easy matter, although correspondence appeared entirely ceased. I knew address letter quite unaware his future career be." Chapter XXXIV "Time passed on. With all, except myself, Heinrich Reichardt appeared forgotten; opinion all, except myself, he forgotten house, friends he made there. Our good Rector removed death post he ably filled; father incapacitated age infirmity attending his duties church, his place filled another. He saved sufficient live upon, built small cottage end village, lived together perfect peace, perfect happiness. "I long grown womanhood, abilities, employed one teachers girls' school, I raised mistress. I conducted win respect chief parochial officers, one I received proposals marriage: I never could reconcile idea becoming wife man long-absent Heinrich, new clerk overseer fain content grateful rejection proposals. "I determined wait patiently till I could learn Heinrich's lips he abandoned his early friend. I could never get believe possibility his unfaithfulness; remembrances mutual studies Book Truth seemed always suggest impossibility his acting completely variance impressions he thence received. "I aware I mentioned hopes his one day coming claim me, I laughed everyone knew anything story--so I said nothing; continued devotedly heart cherish faith long afforded support overwhelming evidence prolonged silence neglect. "There congregation Dissenters town, I twice prevailed join devotions. One day I heard proceedings extraordinary interest would take place meeting-house. A minister great reputation accepted situation Missionary preach Gospel heathen, he visiting different congregations lay his route seaport whence he embark Sandwich Islands. He expected address discourse Dissenters parish, I induced go hear him. "The meeting-house much crowded, I contrived get seat within short distance speakers, waited much interest behold man, who, like first preachers, chosen perilous task endeavouring convert nation savage idolaters faith true Christ. "After short delay he appeared raised platform, introduced congregation minister. I heard nothing introduction, though seemed long one; I saw nothing speaker, though his figure always attracted attentive audience. I saw stranger. In pale, grave, serious features presented me, I recognised Heinrich Reichardt." "He come back last," I exclaimed; "I thought he would. After done poor German boy, impossible he grow manhood forget you." "You shall hear," she replied. "For time heart beat wildly, I thought I obliged leave place, sensations became overpowering; fear disturbing congregation, attracting attention towards myself, influence me, I managed retain sufficient control feelings remain quiet. Nevertheless, eyes upon Heinrich, whole heart soul exclusively engrossed he continued me. "Presently he began speak. As I said, I paid attention preliminary proceedings. I know nothing manner he introduced his audience; he became speaker, every word fell upon ear distinctness seemed quite marvellous me. "And could otherwise? His tall figure, his melancholy yet expressive features, his earnest manner, clear sonorous voice, invested power dignity Apostle, attributes joined associations past he intimately connected, impossible exaggerate influence he exercised me. "He began fervent blessing sought sanctity roof, his hearers, impressed thrilling earnestness his delivery, became hushed kind awe-struck attention. They knelt down, bowed heads prayer. "I appeared power follow general example, remained sitter entire congregation eyes, nay, senses, fixed, rivetted upon preacher. This, course, attracted his attention. I saw look towards surprise, he started, his voice hesitated moment, he almost immediately continued his benediction, and, seemed me, voice tremulous emotion. "Then followed discourse object preacher presenting there. He described wonderful goodness Creator continually raising humble instruments his perform important offices; illustration he referred numerous instances Old New Testaments, God's preference way clearly manifested. "He stated 'a case arisen Divine interposition, equal necessity occurred since first commencement Christianity.' He explained 'there nations still existing distant portion globe state wildest barbarism. Ignorant savages they, many cruel idolatrous customs, cannibals murderers, given worst vices heathen. Their abject pitiable state, he told us, Lord God witnessed Divine commiseration, determined light Christian love shine upon darkness, Almighty wisdom dissipate besotted ignorance. "'But who' he asked, 'was ambassador stupendous Power barbarous states? Who would venture messenger peace comfort cruel savage nation? Was man,' he asked, 'great enough bold enough undertake mission vast importance, attended terrible risks? "'The Almighty Ruler seeks his ministers among great bold,' he added, 'as written, He hath put mighty seats, hath exalted humble meek. And peculiarly occasion, exaltation humblest origin; humble scarcely possible imagine miserable beginning, end attaining distinction honorable. "'Imagine, can, brethren,' he said, 'in building set apart town reception destitute poor, child parentless, friendless, moneyless, condemned, seemed, perpetual raggedness intolerable suffering. A ministering angel, direction Supreme Goodness, took child hand led pauper walls enclosed it, auspices child grew flourished, learned excellent faith admirable practice. "'It ordained he lose sight his angelic teacher. A dire necessity compelled withdraw pure gracious influence. He learn different school, prepare heavier tasks. Manhood, severe responsibilities, came upon him. He sought first render competent holy undertaking, he could consider worthy claim notice made he was. Earnestly he strove Divine assistance encouragement; his qualifications increased, his estimate worthiness necessary object he view, became exalted. "'At last,' he continued, 'it became known Missionary required explain savage people I already alluded, principles Christianity. He appointed sacred trust: he determined, he left country distant one his ministry, present beneficent poured abundant measure Christian virtue; might joined together great vocation, support important trust.' "I heard enough," continued Mrs Reichardt. "All explained, I fully satisfied. The discourse proceeded identify speaker poor boy preserved onerous duties. Then came appeal congregation prayers, assistance could afford, advance holy work conversion heathen. "I tumult pleasant feelings I retained confused recollection subsequent events. I remember I walking home meeting, I heard footsteps quickly following; minutes voice lately filled heart overflowing happiness, addressed me. I much excited remain unconcerned suddenly discovering Heinrich near, I fell fainting his arms. "I carried neighbouring cottage, short time enabled proceed home. In week afterwards married: days sufficed preparations required destination, proceeded port, embarked board ship take us many thousand miles sea, wild, unknown country scene mission." Chapter XXXV Mrs Reichardt obliged break her narrative, concluded end last chapter. As I said, her household duties, numerous, requiring great deal attention, took nearly whole her time. The garden presented agreeable appearance, possessing several different kinds vegetables, various plants raised seed. We succeeded raising several young orange trees pips she brought her basket; promised supply us plenty luscious fruit. Even peas thought dry useless germinated, provided us welcome addition table. I shall never forget first day she added scanty meal dried fish dish smoking potatoes fresh moist earth. After enjoying sufficiently wonder appearance, delight agreeable taste, she informed first introduction Europe, gradual diffusion civilised portions globe. I speak Europe now, I learned companion, good deal geography, obtained insight several branches knowledge. In particular, she told much interesting information England, much I learned Jackson; dwelling upon leading features, remarkable portions history; I must acknowledge I felt secret pride belonging great country. I considered I belonged it, father mother English, though I might called The Little Savage, fixed obscure island great ocean, I felt real home great country mother talked glowingly, chief object ought return hands grandfather belt singular manner come possession. I often thought great England whose glory widely spread durably established, longed means leaving present abode, going search time-honoured shores. But I asked desirable object effected? We means transporting prison accidentally cast. We nothing resembling boat island, tools making one; even put possession treasure, means launching it. The rocky character coast made placing boat water almost impossible. The expectation vessel appearing island appeared quite unreasonable. We seen ships long time, observed great deal far heed signals. We help it, trust Providence bear present evil patiently. Nevertheless, I took glass swept sea far wide search ship, failed discover anything spermaceti whale blowing distance, shoal porpoises tumbling nearer shore, colony seals basking sun rocks nearest sea. My disappointment shared Nero, seemed regard vexation sympathising glance, even gannets turned dull stupid gaze upon me, expression deeply commiserated distress. I long time employed making shelving descent sea, secure part rock, intending landing place boat, case ship come near enough send one rescue. It work great labour, hatchet spade equally suffered endeavours effect object; last I contrived take advantage natural fracture rock, subsequent fall cliff, make rude kind inclined plane, rather steep, rough bad climbers, extremely convenient mother me, whenever prepared embark distant home. My thoughts often directed possibility making island kind boat would hold sufficient provisions voyage nearest larger islands. I spoke Mrs Reichardt subject, she dwelt upon impossibility without either proper tools, slightest knowledge boat-building, producing vessel could trust confidence, neither us knowing anything management open sea; she spoke dangers small boat would meet with, water rough, able make island reasonable time. Yet I daunted difficulties, dissuaded discouraging representations. I thought first fastening loose timber together drifted rocks, much shape boat I could get it, looking stock nails, I found fell far short proper quantity; consequently mode effecting purpose abandoned. I thought felling tree hollowing charring timber. As yet I discovered nothing island shrubs. I quite certain tree grew near enough sea available, I succeed cutting large one fashioning I desired, I means transport. I might possibly make boat capable carrying I wanted put it, I could neither move water boat, boat water, service I wanted it, even island contained tree large enough, I might well leave untouched. Still I would altogether abandon favourite project. I thought willows grew island, fancied I could make framework twisting strongly together, stretching seal skins them. I laboured several weeks,--exercising ingenuity slight stock patience, create object I imperfectly acquainted. I succeed last putting together something remote degree resembling boat brought part whaler's crew island taken away, quarter size, light I could carry without much difficulty landing I constructed cliff. When I came try capabilities, I found terribly lop-sided--it soon began leak, fact exhibited many faults, I forced drag shore, take pieces. I called Mrs Reichardt assistance, though first she seemed averse experiment, she gave great deal information respecting structure small boats, method waterproofing leather fabrics. I attended carefully she said, commenced re-building pretensions art. I made strong frame-work, tolerably sharp end, nearly possible resembling keel bottom. I covered sides pieces strong cloth saturated grease carcases birds, covered whole well-dried seal skins, I made impervious wet. The inside boat nearest water I neatly covered pieces dry bark, I fixed boards, floated island wrecked ships. Finally I put benches sit on, fancied I done everything necessary. I soon got her fishing-pool, delighted find she floated capitally--but I still great deal do. I made neither oars propel her water, sail carry her waves, rowing impossible. I remembered whaler's spare oars mizen, large; nevertheless, served models work upon, time I made rough pair paddles oars, which, though rudely fashioned, I hoped would answer purpose pretty well. The next difficulty use oars, I made many awkward attempts I ascertained proper method proceeding. Again companion, nothing passed her eyes passed vain, shewed boat managed. In short time I could row pool sufficient dexterity turn boat direction I required, I took Nero passenger, he seemed enjoy new gratification praiseworthy decorum; till, I trying turn boat round, movement caused attempt shift his quarters, he little attention build vessel, one moment she capsized, next swimming pool vessel bottom upwards. As she light, I soon righted her, found she received injury, appeared perfectly water-tight. Chapter XXXVI I could prevail upon Mrs Reichardt embark craft, fate first passenger she witnessed shore, deterred her attempting voyage unpromising circumstances. As soon I dried clothes, I making another experiment, one hazardous nature. I would parted Nero, I made lie bottom boat, I could strict control. With I also took little flock gannets, perched round me, gazing air singular stupidity propelled water, I could help bursting laughing. "Indeed," said Mrs Reichardt, "such boat's crew boat never seen seas before. A young savage captain, tame seal boatswain, flock gannets sailors, certainly made curious set adventurers ever floated upon wide ocean." I least remarkable strange group, I nothing pair duck trousers, patched several places; hair, grown long, hung black wavy masses shoulders. My skin tanned sun light brown, different complexion Mrs Reichardt, ever remarkable paleness. Indeed she told I find difficulty establishing claim title European, none Little Savage, she often playfully called me. Nevertheless, trim, companions, I passed fishing-pool sea, intention rowing round island. Mrs Reichardt waved her hand I departed voyage, exhorted careful, long I hearing; she turned away, I thought, return hut. The day remarkably fine. There much cloud horizon, scarcely ripple water: therefore, everything seemed favour project, anything breeze, beating waves rock would great obstacle pursuing voyage either comfort safety. The water clear, although great depth, I could distinguish shells lay sand, observe various kinds fish, curious shape, rushed rapidly beneath boat urged along. I delighted motion, agreeable appearance different novelties met gaze. The light boat glided almost imperceptibly water every stroke oar. Nero lay still his former lesson taught necessity remaining motionless; gannets expressed satisfaction shrill cry rapid fluttering wings. In way, passed without adventure, till I found necessary row distance sea, round projecting rock stood like mighty wall me. I pulled accordingly, better opportunity seeing island I ever obtained. I recognised favourite places, ravine, wood, hut covered beautiful creepers, garden, full flowers, looked agreeable eye: every part seemed look pleasant, except great savage rocks enclosed island every side: even I thought air grandeur gave additional effect scene. Much surprise, I recognised Mrs Reichardt walking rapidly towards part shore, near I obliged pass. From I saw she intent watching point point, know worst, accident befall me, hand necessity rendering assistance. I shouted her, she waved her hand reply. On rounding headland, astonishment extreme finding little bark midst shoal enormous sharks. If I came contact one I lost, frail boat would certainly upset Jackson assured me, ever I allowed monsters come near enough, one snap jaws, would end Little Savage. I thought warning Mrs Reichardt, inclined think I better taken her advice, remained fishing-pool; nevertheless, I went quietly deliberately possible, exercising skill keep clear unexpected enemies. It till I got middle shoal sharks seemed aware anything unusual neighbourhood, soon fully aware presence intruder, exhibited extraordinary excitement, rushing together groups, rapid motion, water became agitated, I obliged exercise skill keep boat steady her course. They dived, rushed fro, jostled other, I thought, anything amicable spirit; still, however, keeping respectful distance boat, I extremely thankful. I urged her strength, purpose getting away unpleasant neighbours; easily disposed of. They came swimming boat, within yards dived, moment it, bar progress. I however pushed on, disappeared, immediately afterwards rose sides me. They evidently getting confidence; fact I ascertained slight apprehension, began approach nearer, gambols threatened every minute overwhelm poor craft, that, light cork, bounced agitated waves, quite much alarmed safety ourselves. The captain one began fear evil; gannets restless, strong admonitions I could prevail Nero retain his recumbent attitude feet; instinct warned approaching danger, I felt comfortable assurance rashness brought present critical position, menaced destruction arrive, sort assistance hand I could rely. Every moment sharks became violent demonstrations, bold approaches, I could scarcely keep boat going, prevent water rushing her sides. The gannets, shewn minutes uneasy, last flown away neighbouring rock, Nero began growl snap, though meditating forcible release his prostrate position, see mischief brewing. As I coaxing quiet, I felt tremendous blow given boat, evidently beneath, she rose air several yards, scattering Nero myself, oars, different directions. The noise made falling appeared instant scattered creatures, I struck rock nearly reached shark made appearance. Just I saw large monster rushing towards me. I thought over. He turned open his great jaws, another instant I devoured. At critical period I saw second object dart shark, attack latter fiercely. It Nero, last I ever saw faithful friend. His timely interposition enabled reach ledge cliff, I perfect safety, hanging strong seaweed, although feet nearly touched water, I could retain position greatest difficulty. The whole shoal presently around me. They first paid attentions boat oars, buffeted till driven close rock, little distance place I found temporary safety. They left things unharmed soon caught sight me, eagerness violence returned tenfold fury. They darted towards body, I obliged lift legs, I snapped one twenty gaping jaws thrust other, eagerness make mouthful limbs. This game carried minutes horrible anxiety me. I fancied struggles loosened seaweed, minutes must give way, I fought torn pieces ravenous crew beneath. I shouted strength lungs scare away; well aware I could escape I myself, merely left violent efforts reach projecting legs, forming semi-circle round me, watched upturned eyes, seemed possess fiendish expression fascinated bewildered me, snapping frail hold supported upon rock. In despair I prayed heartily, rather commend soul Maker, prospect rescued imminent horrible peril. The eyes ravenous monsters seemed mock devotion. I felt roots seaweed giving way: slightest struggle part would I knew hasten dissolution, I resigned fate. In awful moment I heard voice calling name. It Mrs Reichardt cliff high me. I answered eagerness despair. Then came heavy splash water, I heard her implore endeavour make small shrub grew hollow rock, short distance tuft seaweed become serviceable. I looked down. The sharks disappeared; I knew, however, would shortly return, lost moment making effort better position manner I directed. Mrs Reichardt thrown heavy stone water among sharks, loud splash driven away. Before made appearance, I caught firm hold twig, flung position perfect safety. "Thank God he is safe!" I heard Mrs Reichardt exclaim. The sharks return, found anticipated prey escaped, swam lazily sea. "Are much hurt, Frank Henniker?" she presently cried me. "I scratch," I replied. "Then thank God deliverance," she added. I thank God, Mrs Reichardt joined prayer, fervent thanksgiving ours, scarcely possible imagine. Chapter XXXVII I several times pressed Mrs Reichardt conclusion her story, she always seemed reluctant resume subject. It evidently full painful incidents, she shrunk dwelling upon them. At last, one evening sitting together, she working her needle I employed upon net she taught manufacture, I led conversation narrative companion left unfinished. She sighed heavily looked distressed. "It natural expect me, son," she said; "but little know suffering caused recalling melancholy events I detail. However, I led expect entire relation, and, therefore, I endeavour realise anticipations." I assured her I ready wait, whenever might agreeable her narrate termination her interesting history. "It never agreeable me," she replied mournfully; "indeed I would forget it, I could; impossible. The struggle may well made now, time. I therefore commence informing you, long voyage Sandwich Islands, I found ample opportunity studying disposition husband. He much changed since he first left me, his still grateful nature, full truth purity, towards child. A holy enthusiasm seemed exalt ordinary humanity. I could scarcely ever get talk upon religious subjects, he treated earnest exalted manner, impossible avoid carried away his eloquence. "He seemed feel greatness his destination, though raised equality adventurous Saints, established banner Christ among Pagan nations Europe. He fond dilating upon importance his mission, dwelling favour vouchsafed him, causing selected high responsible duty. "It evident he would rather sent associate barbarous people he expected make his converts, raised richest Bishopric England. And yet, exultation, spirit deep melancholy pervading his countenance, well his discourses, seemed imply sense danger. The nimbus saint his eyes associated crown martyrdom. He seemed look forward fatal termination his ministry, proper conclusion his labours. "His conversation often filled dread. His intimations danger seemed first shocking, but, last, I got familiar terrible suggestions, regarded distempered fancies overworked mind. "In way long voyage passed, arrived last place destination. When disembarked, scene presented strange, I could almost believe I passed new world. The luxurious vegetation, character I never seen before--the curious buildings--the singular forms natives, peculiar costume--excited wonder intense degree. "My husband applied diligently learn language people, whilst I intently studied habits customs. We made rapid progress. "As soon I could make understood, I endeavoured make friends women, particularly wives great men, although I first object curiosity regard, I persisted endeavours, succeeded establishing many good understanding. "I found ignorant everything civilised countries considered knowledge--their minds enveloped deplorable darkness--the semblance religion use amongst them, brutal absurd idolatry. "I often tried lead consideration humanising truths, purpose preparing way inculcation great mysteries holy religion: greater portion hearers incompetent understand I seemed desirous teaching, making comprehend principles Christianity appeared hopeless task. "Yet I continued pious labours, without allowing exertions flag--making useful families every way I could--attending sick--giving presents well--and showing every kindness likely make favourable impression savage natures. In way I proceeded good, till I found opportunity service young girl, twelve years age, younger sister one wives great chief. She sprained her ankle great pain, I applied proper remedies gave her speedy relief. Hooloo, her name, moment became warmly attached me, finding her affectionate ingenuous disposition, I became extremely desirous improving upon good impression I made. "At time husband sought, his knowledge mechanical arts, acquaintance medicine, recommend men. He also met much difficulty first, making his information properly appreciated. He sought increase comforts--to introduce agricultural implements useful description, lead generally towards conveniences decencies civilisation. He built house, planted garden, cultivated land, he shewed superior advantages he knew, practised. They seemed marvel much, continued go way. "He also went amongst physician, acquired considerable knowledge medicine simple surgery, he enabled work cures fevers spear wounds, course time made great reputation, many leading chiefs sent anything ailed families, well satisfied he them, he began looked upon one treated particular respect honour, classes natives, highest lowest. "On one occasion king required his services. He suffering sort cholic, native doctors could give relief. My husband administered medicines, stayed his Majesty desired effect, result complete recovery, seemed astonishing members his Sandwich Majesty's court, doctor required administer medicine every one, queen humblest her attendants, though apparently good health. He managed satisfy small portion mixture, he quite certain could harm: professed wonderfully better it." Chapter XXXVIII "His reputation grown great, whatever he required readily granted. He first desired children sent him; learn things enabled much good, readily sanctioned, opened school girls boys, taught first elements civilised education. "Finding made fair progress way, commenced developing real object, inculcation Christian sentiments. This meeting opposition, Reichardt established powerful influence entire community, he next proceeded parents, earnestly strove induce embrace profession Christianity. "His labours entirely unproductive. There began prevail amongst islanders, disposition hear wondrous discourses stranger, he employed, day day, explaining large attentive audiences, history Christian world, observances doctrine faith cemented blood Redeemer. The new startling subjects his discourse, well impressive character his eloquence, frequently deeply moved his hearers; his revelations would often burst forth piercing shouts loud expressions amazement. "In truth moving scene. The noble figure Missionary, his fine features lighted fire holy enthusiasm, surrounded crowd dusky savages, armed spears war clubs, partly clothed feathers, features shewing traces unusual excitement, every joining wild chorus, expressive wonder, could witnessed Christian, without emotion. "But ceremony Baptism first performed them, amazement increased thousandfold. The first member flock Hooloo, I instructed far, principles faith, I acquired influence her mind, she readily consented abandon her idolatrous customs become Christian. "After suitable address natives, assembled thousands witness spectacle, he explained motive object baptism, husband assisted girl sloping green bank led beautiful stream, walked her water till he his waist; then, offering long fervent prayer first victory false worship Devil, might forerunner entire extirpation idolatry land, he, plunging her water, baptised her name Father, Son, Holy Ghost. "All people awed silence ceremony proceeded, burst forth loud cry, came meet new Christian husband came water, waved boughs trees, danced shouted though ecstasy. "We however proceeded extent, without exciting considerable opposition; disrespect towards idols given great offence identified superstitions people, flourished according supported. Complaints made teaching new religion, opposition gods fathers worshipped, powerful party got together purpose pursuing us destruction. "My husband summoned council great chiefs, hear accusations brought him: old idolaters got abused him, threatened punishment monstrous gods, telling lies people, deceiving forged tales strange customs. "They sought could, move judges him, painting terrible fate would befall failed kill white stranger, insulted gods; predicted hosts calamities happen, consequence allowed teller lies work much mischief them. "My husband called upon his defence, first declared judges attributes Deity he worshipped: he created vast heavens, stars, mountains, rivers, sea; his voice spoke thunder, his eye flashed lightning. He dwelt his goodness man, especially Sandwich Islanders, he created purpose enjoying fine country around beholding beauty heavens he dwelt. Then he referred gods worshipped, asked made, senseless things could them; commenting inability serve them, way, harm; went speak benefits he able confer upon them, influence powerful God he worshipped; asked he ever done anything good. Lastly, he promised innumerable benefits, would leave useless gods, turn God power serve them. "It impossible justice animated manner he delivered discourse. It produced great effect upon majority his hearers; powerful minority still strongly influenced him; continued interrupt terrible outcries. "Most leading chiefs his suffering harm. They bore mind advantages he conferred, his skill medicine, superior wisdom various things, people would lose he put death. They also remembered hope he held future benefits, course could expect, offered violence. "The result was, husband suffered go harmless meeting, great disappointment his enemies, could scarcely kept laying violent hands upon him. The danger he escaped, unfortunately, render prudent. Far it. He believed he chosen instrument Most High, win savages depths idolatry Paganism; continued, every occasion presented itself, endeavour win souls God. "The school increased, several parents suffered baptised, regular observance Lord's Day amongst belonged little flock. Even many islanders, although become Christians, attended religious services, spoke well us. "We brought young people able teach brethren sisters; hoped able establish missions parts island, sometimes made excursions; preaching inestimable blessings gospel islanders, exhorting abandon dark customs heathen follies. I far behind husband good work, acquired much influence among women he exercised men: indeed generally looked upon holy people, deserved treated veneration respect." Chapter XXXIX "Things went flourishing way several years; husband, deeply impressed responsibility his position, chosen servant God, devoted entirely great work he undertaken, he often seemed overlook claims upon his attention her he chosen his partner, his struggle Powers Darkness. Sometimes I see several days; often together, he abstracted, he seem aware I present. Whenever I could get speak himself, he would dilate unspeakable felicity he felt drawing nearer end his work. I affected know he alluded; I always felt he referring impression he entertained his speedy dissolution, he taken he first embraced mission. "I tried get rid misgivings recalling dangers difficulties triumphantly passed, referring encouraging state things existed present time; nevertheless, I could prevent sinking heart, whenever I heard venture upon subject; he absent me, I often experienced agony anxiety till his return. I saw, however, real apprehension, endeavoured persuade none existed; probably I succeeded, husband frequently indulged references separation. "Alas," she exclaimed, mournfully, "he better informed I proximity Celestial Home, he long zealously preparing himself. He, doubtless, his intimation high, his translation realms bliss, remote consequence his undertaking mission he accepted; he familiarised his mind daily duty, his constant references sought prepare catastrophe he knew inevitable." Here Mrs Reichardt became sensibly affected, time she could proceed her narrative. She, however, last, yet I could see tears traced her wan cheeks, much her soul moved terrible details she obliged enter. "In midst success," she presently resumed, "when established congregation, baptised hundreds men, women, children, completed regular place worship, extensive school-house, fully regularly attended, European vessel paid us short visit, soon which, dreadful scourge small-pox, broke amongst people. Both children adults seized, soon one died dozen attacked. "Soon greatest alarm pervaded natives; husband implored stop pestilence, power felt convinced he his hands. He possible do, unfortunately little. His recommendation remedial measures rarely attended desired results. Death busy. The people died scores, survivors, excited vindictive men formerly sought his death disparaging gods, began fall rapidly regard reverence husband, murmurs first, execrations afterwards, violent menaces subsequently, attended whenever he appeared. "He preached resignation Divine Will; resignation savage virtue. He indefatigable his attentions sick; he careful seemed speediest die. The popular feeling increased every hour; he appeared, however, defy his fate--walking unconcernedly amongst crowds infuriated savages brandishing heavy clubs, threatening points sharp spears; his eye never blinked, his cheek never blanched, he walked his way inwardly praising God, careless evil passions raged around him. "It Sabbath morn--our service far advanced; could boast limited congregation, many died, fled pestilence interior; others avoided place consequence threats countrymen. A children, two three women, teacher address. "We engaged singing Psalm, furious crowd, mad rage, seemed, screaming yelling frightful manner, brandishing weapons though attack enemy, burst little chapel, seized husband midst his devotions. "I rushed forward protect numerous weapons aimed his life, dragged back hair head; infuriate cries gestures, made look like demons broke loose hell, fell upon clubs spears. "Reichardt made resistance, he merely clasped his hands firmly, looked Heaven devoutly, he continued Psalm he commenced entered. This delay his fate. "They beat his brains close me, I covered his blood, I believe I shared fate, I fainted terror horrible scene I forced spectator. "I learned afterwards powerful chief interfered, I carried away dead alive, state I long remained. As soon I became sufficiently strong moved, I took advantage whaler calling island, homeward bound, beg passage. The captain heard lamentable story, took board soon he could, shewed seaman's sympathy sufferings. "I returned England him, place encountered terrible storm, obliged take boats, chance saving lives. What became I know not, two boats parted company soon leaving wreck. I trust he managed reach land safety, his country, enjoying comforts make life covetable. "What became part crew brought boat, led fires lighted, I doubt. But I think quitting island, crowded boat was, state crew, scarcely possible made distant island steered." Chapter XL Mrs Reichardt's story made sensible impression me. I longer wondered pallor her countenance, air melancholy first seemed remarkable; she suffered severely, her sufferings recent left effects upon her frame. I thought good deal her narrative, wondered much men could got leave comfortable homes, travel thousands thousands miles across fathomless seas, hope converting nation treacherous savages, sure slaughtered first outbreak ill-feeling. I could admire character Reichardt--in his actions he exhibited marked nobility nature. He would present woman strongest claims upon his gratitude, till he obtained position reputation should, his opinion, make worthy her; though he presentiment fate would overtake him, he fulfilled his duties missionary holy enthusiasm made regard his approaching martyrdom greatest earthly distinctions. I felt regret I known man. I knew much I lost missed example. My heard story led much private communing respecting religion. I could consider little better savage, like brutal Sandwich Islanders; conduct Jackson degree less inhuman idolaters shewn teacher he power. I fancied time I served right, his villainous conduct father, brutal conduct me: God punished his misdeeds, I felt satisfied I business put greater torment satisfaction private injuries. I fancied God might angry me, kept island punishment offences; I conversation Mrs Reichardt point. "Nothing," she observed, "can excuse ill-feeling towards Jackson; he bad man, without doubt, he deserved condign punishment his usage parents; Divine founder religion urged us return good evil." "Yes," I answered readily, "but I suffered bad father mother, I prevented his mischief." "You know suffer," she replied. "Jackson, without terrible punishment he brought upon himself, might eventually become contrite, restored friends well enabled obtain grandfather's property. God frequently performs marvellous things humble instruments, he hath said, 'There joy heaven one sinner repenteth, ninety-nine men.'" "Surely, raising wicked man good," I cried. "Not all," she replied. "The repentant one gained ranks great enemy--it one lost found again--it soul added blessed. Therefore joy heaven abundant conversion. The natural heirs heaven--their rights acknowledged without dispute--their claim recognised allowed, receive portion eternal joy matter course, without necessity exciting demonstrations satisfaction hail advent sinner saved." "I do not think villain Jackson would ever go heaven," I observed. "'Judge not, lest ye judged,'" she answered; "that text cannot often impressed upon persons anxious condemn eternal torment believe worse themselves. It great presumption us poor creatures clay, anticipate proceedings Infinite Wisdom. Let us leave high prerogative judgment Almighty Power, exercised, opinions even worst fellow-creatures, let us exercise comprehensive charity, mingled prayer even eleventh hour, may turned evil ways, embraced prospect salvation, mercy Creator held them." In similar conversations, Mrs Reichardt would endeavour plant mind soundest views religion; she spoke well, convincingly, I little trouble understanding her meaning, retaining uttered. It not, I stated, religion she led thoughts, although certainly frequent subject conversation. She sought instruct various branches knowledge she acquired insight, way I picked much information respecting grammar, geography, astronomy, writing, arithmetic, history, morals, I gained I school, instead forced remain desolate island. I need say I still desired leave it. I long tired place, notwithstanding united exertions, enjoyed many comforts could hoped for. Our hut metamorphosed something Mrs Reichardt styled rustic cottage, which, covered flowers creepers, really looked pretty; garden added greatly pleasant appearance: near house transplanted everything bore flower could found island, planted shrubs, that, carefully nurtured made rapid growth, screened hut wind. I built sort out-house storing potatoes firewood, fowl-house gannets, numerous flock; planted fence round garden, Mrs Reichardt said, looked selected dwelling beloved England, heart rural district, instead circumscribed little island thousands miles across wide seas, home fond talking. Although companion always spoke warmly land her birth, evidently would glad return it, she never grieved her hard fate being, were, prisoner rock, reach friends kindred; indeed, she used chide impatient detention, insensible blessings I enjoyed. "What temptations free here?" she would say. "We see nothing world; cannot contaminated vices, suffer follies. The hideous wars--the terrible revolutions--the dreadful visitations famine pestilence--are completely unknown us. Robbery, murder, fraud, thousand phases human wickedness, altogether escape. There time, men, purpose leading holy lives, abandoned fair cities lived enjoyment every luxury, sought cave distant desert, where, lair wild beast, stone pillow, handful herbs meal, cup water beveridge, lived remnant days constant succession mortifications, prayers, penitence. "How different," she added, "is state. We far removed sinfulness world hermit desert, whilst enjoyment comforts strangers." "But probably," I observed, "these men penitents, went desert much punish bodies transgressions flesh, acquire solitary communion, better knowledge spirit likely obtain old haunts." "Some penitents, doubt," she answered, "but they, obtained sanctity extraordinary reputation, induced others, whose lives blameless, follow example, time desert became colonised recluses, rivalled intensity devotions extent privations." "Would commendable," I asked, "if men remained community belonged, withstanding temptation, employed labour creditable useful country?" "No doubt would," she replied; "but religion has, unfortunately, often result impulse rather conviction; period referring, thought sinful human nature could gain attributes saintship neglecting social duties, punishing humanity severest manner. Even recent times, present day, Catholic countries, customary individuals sexes, abandon world might render ornaments, shut buildings constructed expressly receive them, continue go course devotions privations till death puts end voluntary imprisonment. "In modified instance seclusion," she added, "there features different case. We forced impoverish blood insufficient diet, mortify flesh various forms punishment. We neglect worship God. We offer daily thanks his loving care us, sing his praises continual hymns: instead wasting hours day unmeaning penances, fill time employments add health, comfort, happiness: enable us better appreciate goodness Power mindful welfare." "Have wish then, leave island?" I inquired. "I gladly avail first opportunity presented getting safely England," she replied. "But I would wait patiently proper time. It useless repining prolonged stay here, looks like ungrateful doubting power God remove us. Be assured he preserved us long, many dangers, abandon us require his interposition favour." I endeavoured gather consolation representations: perhaps young people easily reconciled like, elders, I cannot say I succeeded becoming satisfied position. Chapter XLI The perils first voyage deterred making similar experiment; I recovered boat, strengthened it, fitted could either turned well locker: I used row little distance sea free sharks fish. But grand effort direction completion net, which, assisted Mrs Reichardt, I managed manufacture. By time she gained sufficient confidence accompany fishing excursions; she would even take oars whilst I threw net, assisted dragging boat. The first time got haul, I afraid safety little craft. The locker full, numbers great fish, I flung net, flapping leaping bottom boat. It began sink lower water agreeable either us, I found absolutely necessary throw back sea greater portion catch. We rowed carefully land, rejoicing command, means obtaining abundant supply food whenever desired it. Mrs Reichardt also land excursions. Together explored every part island; chief object plants enriching garden, often search novelties, invariably brought home additions collection; companion acquired knowledge botany, would explain names, characters, qualities different species, made journeys peculiarly interesting. Our appearance often caused considerable amusement other; respective costumes must extremely curious eyes stranger. Neither wore shoes stockings--these things possess, could procure; wore leggings sandals seal skin protect us thorns plants cacti tribe, among obliged force way. My companion wore conical cap seal skin, protected her complexion sun, rude attempt umbrella I made her. She on, occasions, pair coarse cloth trousers, her dress would torn pieces she got half mile bush; surmounted tight spencer she herself manufactured man's waistcoat, dimity petticoat, buttoned her throat, fastened way wrists. My head covered broad-brimmed hat, made dry grass, I platted. I wore sailor's jacket, much worse wear, patched seal skin, pair duck trousers, similarly repaired. Although expeditions perfectly harmless, go without weapons. At instigation companion, I made good stout bow plenty arrows, exercised frequently aiming mark, acquired considerable skill use them. I several arrows hard wood tipped sharp fish-bones, iron nails, kind pouch behind me; sheath American knife, I used taking plants ground. I basket made long grass island, slung around me, served contain treasures; I carried bow hand. My companion, addition her umbrella, bore long staff, small basket tied round her waist usually contained little refreshment; she would say knowing might occur delay return, therefore better take meal us. And least agreeable portion day's labour repast; would seat quiet corner, surrounded flowers, shaded brushwood sun, eat dried fish pick birds, roast potatoes means fire dried sticks, wash simple dinner flask pure water--the refreshing portion banquet. I had, I stated, attained singular degree skill use bow arrow, which, fire-arms, often important service procuring food land. I made another use skill--an application afforded vast deal satisfaction. My old enemies sharks used still frequent certain portion coast great numbers, soon I became master weapon, I would stand near edge rock safe, singling victim, aim his upper fin, I often found effect ridding place fellow. I bore intense hatred creatures, fright put memorable voyage discovery, slaughter beloved Nero, I determined wage incessant war them, long I could manufacture arrow, single shark remained coast. As often traversed island without accident, dreamt danger. We never met kind animals, except old friends seals, kept near sea. Of birds, gannets generally sole frequenters island; seen, rare intervals, birds totally different character, I shot. Indeed, excursions, I always look stranger feathered race, I might exercise skill upon him. If he proved eatable, he sure welcome; even he could cooked, he afforded entertainment, hearing Mrs Reichardt his name habits. We discovered natural hollow lay low quite hid till came close it, descend steep declivity covered shrubs. At bottom soil evidently productive, found trees growing considerable height, marked contrast shrubby plants grew parts island. We called spot Happy Valley, became favourite resting-place. I remember one occasions, made dinner several hours employed seeking plants, procured good supply, remains meal lay great tree, beneath spreading branches resting ourselves. It quite side island, within quarter mile sea. Abundance curious plants grew place, Mrs Reichardt wandered little distance examine within view. I peering trees shrubs around discover new comer. I wandered opposite direction taken companion, creeping round clump shrubs twenty yards off, I detected chirping noise, I heard loud scream. I turned sharply round beheld Mrs Reichardt, evidently agony terror, running towards prodigious swiftness. She dropped her umbrella her staff, her cap fallen her head, her long hair, disarranged her sudden flight, streamed behind her shoulders. At first I see anything could caused terrible alarm, seconds I heard crushing among thicket shrubs she running, heavy weight forced them; presently issued extraordinary monster. It came forward quick pace, head erect ten feet, jaws wide open, midst issued forked tongue darted inconceivable rapidity. Its body long, thick ordinary tree; covered bright shining scales seemed different colours, propelled along ground folds various sizes, length tail several yards behind. Its eyes bright fierce. Its appearance certainly accounted companion's alarm. "Fly!" she cried accents intense terror, she rushed towards me, "fly, lost!" She gave hurried glance behind her, seeing formidable monster full chase, she power reach spot I advanced, sunk overpowered terror, fainting feet. My first movement step across her body purpose disputing passage monster, erect posture, bow drawn tight I could pull it, I waited seconds till I could secure good aim, I knew everything depended steadiness resolution. On came prodigious antagonist, making terrible hissing he approached, his eyes flashing, his jaws expanded he intended swallow mouthful, enormous folds his huge body passing like wheels ground, crushing thick plants came way like grass. I must acknowledge heart I felt strange sinking sensation, I remembered chance escape lay giving monster mortal wound, imminence danger seemed afford resolution I required. He close behind, direct line tree dined, I twenty yards it. Directly his head darted round front tree, making good mark, I let fly arrow direct, I thought, his eye, hoping, penetrating his brain, settle once. But he moved his head moment, arrow went his open jaws, one penetrated, going deep tree behind, pinned his head close bark. As soon huge creature found hurt, he wound his enormous body round trunk, his desperate exertions swayed great tree backwards forwards, I would done one smallest branches. Fearful he would liberate I could save senseless companion, quick possible I discharged arrows his body, took effect various places. His exertions became terrible I hastily snatched Mrs Reichardt arms, fright seemed give supernatural strength, I ran fast I could shortest way hut. Fortunately, I gone half mile, companion came her senses, able continue her flight. We got home last, half dead fatigue fright; nevertheless first thing barricade entrances. We left loop-holes reconnoitre; sat hours arrival, waiting monster's approach fear trembling. We go sleep night. We not, either us, go next day. The next night one watched slept. The second day courage far returned, I wanted go look constant subject conversation. But Mrs Reichardt dissuaded me. She told enormous python, serpent boa species, common northern coast America. Probably brought island drifted tree, prodigious reptile, wounds received likely much harm, would doubt lurking about, ready pounce upon either us directly appeared. On third day, nothing occurred increase alarm, I determined know worst; I got stealth house, armed fresh bow, good supply arrows, hatchet slung side, American knife--with mind made another conflict necessary--I crept stealthily along, eyes awake slightest motion, ears open slightest sound, till I approached scene late unequal struggle. I must I began draw breath rather rapidly, heart beat quickly, I came near place I left terrible enemy. To extreme surprise python disappeared. There tree still standing, though foliage branches strewed ground, great portion bark ground powder. At base trunk pool blood mingled fragments bark, broken arrows, leaves, mould. The reptile escaped. But he? Not altogether without anxiety I began look traces his retreat; easily found. With arrow ready immediate flight, I followed stream blood still visible grass, led tree, accompanied unmistakable marks great serpent's progress, direct line sea. There disappeared. When I discovered this, I breathed again. There doubt monster survived conflict, he hundreds miles away, likely return place he received rough welcome. It may readily believed I lost time taking agreeable news companion. Chapter XLII I become tired looking ship. Though day day, week week, I made careful scrutiny glass, I said, brought result. I sometimes fancied I saw vessel appearing line horizon, I would pile faggots light them, throw water make smoke, Jackson done; without avail. Either vision deceived me, signals observed, ship's course lie direction island. We storms several occasions, wreck left coast. I began think doomed live lives rock, frequently found striving manfully resigned fate, days I would cheerfully endeavour make best it. But increasing desire I felt get England, I might seek grandfather, put possession his diamonds, always prevented state things enduring long. I obtained Mrs Reichardt idea value stones, importance restoration relative, I often thought satisfaction I enjoy presenting him, restorer valuable property, which, doubt, long since given lost. But latterly, I thought less things; chance leaving island seemed remote, prospect ever seeing grandfather distant, I ceased take interest contents belt. The diamonds seemed become valueless useless; handful wheat would much desirable. It time since I seen belt, inquired it. Thus lived without incident occurring worth relating--when one day appearance atmosphere indicated storm, violent hurricane, attended peals thunder lurid flashes lightning, lasted whole day evening. The wind tore trees roots, blew outhouses, made terrible havoc garden, threatened tumble hut heads. We could think going beds whilst tempest raging around us, sat up, listening creaking boards, anticipating every moment whole fabric would blown pieces. Fortunately, bark I covered roof, great measure protected us rain, came torrents; every part equally impervious, discomfort increased seeing water drip through, form pools floor. The thunder still continued intervals, sometimes loud startling effect upon us. My companion knelt said her prayers great fervour, I joined scarcely less devotion. Indeed awful night, position, though shelter, without danger. The incessant flashes lightning seemed play round edifice, determined set blaze; dreadful peals thunder followed, rolled heads, burst upon creaking boards shut us fury. I fancied twice I heard storm bursts sound quite different character peals thunder. They loud, reverberate much; seemed come nearer, difference sound became perceptible. "Great God!" exclaimed Mrs Reichardt, starting her kneeling posture, "that gun ship." The wind seemed less boisterous seconds, thunder ceased. We listened breathlessly loud boom heard, repeated. In moment afterwards ears startled terrifying combination screams, shrieks, cries, wailings I ever heard. My blood seemed chilled veins. "A ship struck," whispered companion, scarcely her breath. "The Lord mercy crew!" She sank her knees prayer, poor souls struggling jaws death. The wind still howled, thunder still roared, fiercest war elements, I fancied I could every hear piercing shrieks sent heaven assistance. I thought twice venturing out, I remembered safety companion completely bound own, I could reconcile leaving her; I also well aware, till terrible fury tempest abated, impossible slightest service people wrecked ship, even could I remain unharmed exposed violence weather. I however awaited much impatience intense anxiety till storm measure spent itself; occur till sunrise next morning. The wind fell, thunder lightning ceased, rain evidently diminishing, brightness coming day began burst darkest night ever visited island. Mrs Reichardt would left behind; possible she might useful, taking her small basket things she imagined might required, she accompanied rocks nearest sea. On arriving there, extraordinary scene presented itself. The sea strewed spars, masts, chests, boats stove otherwise injured, casks, empty hen-coops, innumerable pieces floating wreck continually dashed rocks, washed ashore, wherever opening sea presented itself. At little distance lay remains fine ship, her masts gone board, her decks open, fact complete wreck, sea lately making clean sweep, carrying overboard everything could resist fury. I could see nothing resembling human being, though companion looked carefully round hope discovering poor creature, might need assistance. It appeared, however, people ship taken boats, swamped, probably ventured devoured sharks. Had crew remained board, would probability saved; vessel thrown almost high dry. As soon satisfied sharks neighbourhood, I launched little boat, taking oar, pulled direction wreck, reached minutes. She heeled striking, water quite smooth her lee. I contrived climb main chains, thence board, soon afterwards diligently exploring ship. I penetrated every place I could effect entrance, marvelling much variety things I beheld. There seemed abundance everything, things quite new me, I bewildered novelty variety. Having discovered coil new rope, I hauled deck, soon made fast little boat ship. Then I made hasty rope ladder I threw over, Mrs Reichardt minutes standing side. Her knowledge necessary inform uses several strange things I saw, select use desirable. She well acquainted interior ship, explained numerous conveniences, I could admire ingenuity man, creating stupendous machines. The ship much water hold, I forced dive armoury. It first time I seen things, I handled muskets pistols vast deal curiosity; companion explained loaded fired, I saw advantage bow arrow, selecting two three carry away, I hesitated assured would perfectly useless without ammunition. I might remained content savage weapons already served well, Mrs Reichardt, course survey, discovered several tin canisters powder perfectly uninjured, abundance shot bullets, I quickly took possession. From parts vessel selected bags grain, barrels flour, provisions various kinds; wearing apparel, boxes tools, numerous bottles jars, contents I perfectly unacquainted, though discovery gave great gratification companion. What excited wonder, various kinds agricultural implements found hold, short time I made aware proper employment spades, harrows, ploughs, thrashing-machines, many things, existence I never dreamt. We found also quantities various kinds seeds roots, sort twigs growing pots, Mrs Reichardt particularly begged leave behind, would greatest use us; she added that, various signs, she believed ship emigrant vessel going settlers, place she could say. We made ceremony breaking open lockers chests, every discovered variety things, which, could transfer island, would add greatly comfort; got ashore, puzzle neither us seemed capable solving. Our little boat would contain lighter articles; many could conveniently put together shortly stowed her. With cargo returning, companion called attention noise seemed come distant corner vessel, she laughed exhibited much satisfaction I believed close upon discovery far important yet hit upon. We continued make way seemed way part vessel, led great measure noises proceeded thence. It dark here, obliged get light, companion procured ship's lantern, lighted means tinderbox, led place I could discern several animals, evidently dead. She however ascertained two young calves, three four sheep, many young pigs, still giving noisy evidence existence. She searched found food them, ate great avidity. The larger animals she told cows horses; fallen down, gave signs life. My companion entered long debate remove living animals dead; she dwelt eloquently upon great advantages would accrue us, could succeed transporting island survivors. After giving good feed, seeing could remove present, descended safely boat gained shore without accident. Then housed treasures, putting together raft various planks barrels knocking rocks, I knew would take good deal time, I thought I would inspect ship's boats, which, bottom upwards, drifting within yards us. To great satisfaction, one I ascertained little injured, forced her ashore, united exertions turned her over. In hour made her water-tight, picked her oars, pulling merrily wreck. Chapter XLIII Had cows horses alive, must left behind, could removed them, smaller animals comparatively little difficulty got deck, descended boat. We added things lay handy, minutes laughingly driving four-footed treasures shore, extreme astonishment gannets, seemed though would never cease flap wings, new associates driven them. In way removed portable agricultural implements, bed bedding, cots, hammocks, furniture, framework house, preserved provisions kinds, medicine chest, boxes books, crates china glass, sorts useful tools, domestic utensils; short, course next two three weeks, repeated journeys, filled every available place could find managed rescue. Then came another terrible storm lasted two days, wreck broken up, scattered every direction. I however managed secure drift wood, tubs, spars, chests, got shore, proved greatest service time afterwards. Numerous acquisitions way, us infinitely better pleased able rescue ill-fated crew, belonged. But one could escaped, one body cast shore, young woman, lay her face ground, her wet clothes clinging round her. We turned her carefully over, I beheld face seemed wonderfully fair beautiful. She escaped sharks, dead several hours--most probably she cast shore waves soon ship struck, she escaped also rocks, which, she dashed against, would left fearful signs contact her delicate frame. The sight her corpse gave many melancholy thoughts. I thought delight she might caused us, she saved. What pleasant companion she might proved! Indeed, I looked her pale cold features, I fancied she might reconciled ending existence island--ay, even abandonment favourite scheme seeking grandfather give back his diamonds. We took her much pity affection she nearest dearest relative, carried her home placed her Mrs Reichardt's bed; I laid planks together, shape Mrs Reichardt called coffin--and I dug her deep grave guano. And I found crying I never cried before, heart seemed weary faint. In solemn silence carried her her grave, read her funeral service Prayer-book, kneeling praying nameless creature, never seen alive, though she companion many years; us shedding tears her hapless fate lost beloved sister. And filled her grave departed, went home, passed miserable day ever endure since first cast upon island. I numerous occupations kept actively employed. Still I could long time help recalling mind pale face looked piteously upon I first beheld it; I would leave work, give melancholy thoughts till attention called appeal companion. I made kind monument place she buried, planted finest flowers had; I never passed spot without prayer, I approaching holy ground. I must forget add, days wreck agreeably surprised visitors that, though unexpected, extremely welcome. I noticed strange birds wandering various parts island. On coming notice companion, immediately recognised fowls ducks doubt escaped ship. We might now, therefore, constitute little colony, Mrs Reichardt immediate governors, settlers mingled community calves, sheep, pigs, poultry, lived excellent terms other; quadrupeds permission roam pleased, bipeds kept within certain distance government house. The old hut suffered much storm I determined building another better position, recourse framework house I taken wreck. I difficulty putting several parts together, last succeeded, small, commodious dwelling result. Near I laid new garden, wherein I planted orange-trees reared, well many seeds roots brought wreck. A little beyond I enclosed paddock, wherein I planted twigs found pots, proved fruit trees. When I done this, I thought agricultural implements, much desired make use handy plough amongst them, I learned advantages might arise it. At first, I yoked plough, Mrs Reichardt held it: proved hard awkward work I kept projecting sorts plans lessening labour--the best yoking calves, making pull instead myself. This easily thought done. The animals prove apt pupils, course time, good deal patience, manoeuvring, I succeeded making perform work expected do. Thus, building, gardening, planting, farming, time flew quickly, course next year aspect place become quite changed. The guano enriched soil made every kind vegetation thrive almost marvellous rapidity luxuriance. We comfortable house, vine creeping one place, young pear-tree another. We supplied choicest oranges, apples several kinds. We abundance furniture, inexhaustible stock provisions. We gorgeous show flowers many different species; new kitchen garden full useful vegetables--young fruit trees yielding produce wherever planted--the poultry doubled number--the calves taking upon full dignity state cow bull--the ewes numerous lambs--and pigs grown excellent pork, already produced one litter would found equally desirable provisions ran scarce. We two growing crops, different kinds grain, large pasture-field fenced round. The Little Savage, seventeen, transformed farmer, cultivation farm care live stock soon left time indulging vain longings leave island, useless regrets fair creature who, even death, I regarded greatest ornament. Two years later, still greater improvements, still greater additions became visible. We establishing dairy farm small scale, herds flocks, well pigs poultry, increased rapidly, promised years thriving farmers ever lived part world cultivation land. Chapter XLIV Although first experimental voyage proved hazardous, I better provided meeting perils, I became anxious make another attempt circumnavigate island. The boat belonged wrecked ship, frequent trips I made her shore, I could manage well I rowing boats life. With assistance Mrs Reichardt, pulled oar almost well myself, could get her along good style, even heavily laden, labours together taken her timidity deterred her trusting herself me, I first ventured island. I was, however, differently circumstanced now, I then. Instead frail cockle-she will, threatened capsized every billow approached it, would scarcely hold two persons comfortably, I master well-built ship's-boat, would hold half dozen ease, except rough weather, safe place ashore. I repaired slight damage timbers received, made awning protect us rowing heat sun; I also raised sail, would relieve us good deal labour. When everything prepared, I urged Mrs Reichardt accompany voyage round island; excursion I hoped would turn equally pleasant profitable. I found her averse trusting herself farther shore absolutely necessary. She raised kinds objections--prominent among want seamanship managing boat open sea; danger might arise sudden squall coming on; her fear getting amongst shoal sharks, risk ran driving projecting rock; I overruled all. I showed her, taking little trips sea, I could manage boat either sail oars, assured her keeping close island, could run ashore danger could reach us; nothing could easier keeping reach rocks sharks. I think I quite convinced her her fears groundless, repeated entreaties, fineness weather, her dislike left island, whilst I risking life sea, prevailed, she promised join second experiment. Her forethought, however, fully demonstrated occasions, she suffer boat leave shore till she provided accident might prevent return anticipated time. A finer day voyage could selected. The sky without cloud, wind enough purpose I wanted, without apprehensions increased. I got awning, spread sail, handing Mrs Reichardt her appointed seat, bid farewell four-footed two-footed friends ashore, gazing us knew parting protectors. I pushed boat off, wind caught sail, she glided rapidly deep water. I let her proceed way quarter mile island, tacked; boat, obedient position sail, altered her course, proceeded rate considerable distance. Mrs Reichardt, notwithstanding her previous fears, could help feeling exhilarating effect adventurous voyage. We floating, safely gracefully, upon billows, nothing sea sky every direction one, rugged shores island home gave bold, yet menacing feature view. My heart seemed expand majestic prospect me. Never mariner, discovering prodigious continent, felt greater degree exultation I experienced, directing little vessel immense wilderness waters spread me, till joined line horizon. I sat side Mrs Reichardt, allowed boat proceed course, either required directing hand, present direction agreeable, I felt inclination alter it. "I easily imagine," said I, "the enthusiasm men Columbus, whose discovery America relating day. The vocation early navigators glorious one, and, tracked way many thousand miles pathless water, found strange seas, expecting appearance land, hitherto unknown civilised world, must felt importance mission discoverers." "No doubt, Frank," she replied. "And probably supported great man named, severe trials he obliged endure, eve discovery render his name famous generations. He endured intolerable hardships, ship long without sight land, one thought worth look it, he expected his crew would mutiny, insist returning. At critical period his existence, first one indication land, another made manifest; curiosity disheartened sailors became excited; hope revived breast immortal captain; man induced ascend main-top, his joyful cry land woke slumbering spirit crew. In way, new world first presented attention inhabitants old." "It appears unjust," I observed, "that important discovery become known us, name original discoverer, subsequent visitor shores." "Undoubtedly," said Mrs Reichardt, "it apparently unfair Americus Vespucius obtain honour Christopher Columbus alone deserved. But fame natural right whose courage enterprise procured unrivalled acquisition, one deprive him. His gigantic discovery may always known America, world acknowledges obligation Columbus, knows little beyond name his rival." "Were immediate results large addition geographical knowledge, beneficial entire human race ought been?" "I think were. The vast continent thrown open advance civilisation, may divided two portions, south north. The former inhabited harmless effeminate race, enjoyed many refinements civilisation; knowledge arts, instance, shewn us ruins cities, considerable; possessed extensive buildings bold ornate style architecture; made lavish use precious metals, land extremely rich, wore dresses shewed certain perfection manufacture textile fabrics, slight degree taste art formation. "The Spaniards, led part continent desire enrich gold earliest discoverers found new country considerable quantities, invaded territories peaceful people, and, superior knowledge warlike weapons, ignorance intentions invaders prevailed amongst natives ranks, series massacres, enabled, though comparatively small force, obtain possession vast empire established time immemorial, turn Spanish colony. "The blood harmless race flowed like water; great Incas Emperors deposed murdered, splendid temples plundered riches, nobles priests tortured make change faith, great mass people became slaves warlike conquerors. It way gold Mexico Peru enriched treasury Spain; every ingot curse blood upon it, time Spanish power, height, began decline Europe, till sunk scale nations among least important. The colonies revolted mother country, became independent states; curse followed infamous appropriation country, seems cling descendants first criminals, neither government people prospers; evident independent states must time absorbed great republic, sprung peaceable means, side, whilst content colonies." "To republic allude?" "You may remember I told entire continent divided south north." "Exactly." "The history southern portion I rapidly sketched you, northern find totally different character." "Pray let hear it." "When North America first discovered, found inhabited race savages, divided several tribes. They manufactures; knowledge art science; lived impenetrable woods huts, pretension architecture; went almost entirely naked, extremely warlike, fond hunting, known devour enemies killed battle. "To barbarous race came adventurous men across stormy Atlantic, distant island England--" "Ah, England!" I exclaimed, "that country parents--that home grandfather; let hear anything say England." Mrs Reichardt smiled animation, proceeded without making comment upon I said. "England possessed period many adventurous spirits, ready dare every danger obtain country share honours lands assumed enterprise navigators. By men different portions northern continent America discovered; fame new lands, wonderful productiveness admirable climate, soon spread amongst countrymen, time time various ships left English ports small bands adventurers, made termed settlements country savages--not mercilessly massacring Spaniards done south, plundering possessed, purchasing certain districts pieces land original occupants, peacefully cultivated; numbers increased, multiplied habitations, obtained barter savages fresh accessions territory." "The English showed much humane people Spaniards," I observed. "But never come collision wild natives country?" "Frequently," Mrs Reichardt replied, "but measure unavoidable. As new settlers England landed country, required land; savages inclined barter; become jealous strangers, desirous driving back ships became numerous. Acts hostility committed savages upon settlers, often marked great brutality: exasperated latter, joined warlike association, notwithstanding numbers daring, drove neighbourhood, till either conquest, treaties, purchase, Englishmen descendants obtained greater portion North America." "Do still hold possession it?" I asked. "Up recent date, whole vast acquisition colony obedience government England; dispute arisen mother country colony, struggle took place, ended latter throwing subjection laws England. The extensive provinces joined together union equal privileges powers, since gone name Government United States North America. This great republic I alluded, gradually absorbing minor Southern States its--union, threatens distant date spread English language English race whole continent America." "Has England completely lost country she colonised?" I inquired, feeling interested subject. "No, great portion still remains her possession," she replied. "The people preserved allegiance neighbours thought proper rise revolt, state great prosperity, governed laws England, supported her power. The English possessions North America form extensive district. It is, however, inconsiderable fraction vast countries still remaining dominion England. Her territories lie every quarter globe; indeed sun never sets upon immense empire--an empire conquests Alexander, Caesar, formidable state existed ancient times, cannot moment compared; bear mind various climates, far-distant shores, flag country affords protection colonist he would enjoy his land, may entertain idea vast power government possesses make respected many opposite points source whence emanates." I much interested description, I neglected notice rate boat driving water. I rose great alacrity shift sail, got several miles island, I take care might blown sight land. I lost time putting her another tack, proceeded far direction I found wind lull, presently sail drooped mast, dead calm. It became necessary take oars, presently pulling strength direction land. This went time till tired, I surprised little progress made. We lay oars took refreshment, pulled additional vigour; I began suspect receding land instead approaching it, called Mrs Reichardt's attention fact island diminishing size notwithstanding length time pulling towards it. "Ah, Frank," she said, melancholy tone voice, "I time entertained suspicions strength expended vain. It clear got current every moment taking us farther sea, breeze soon spring up, shall lose sight island, then, heaven knows become us." I shook sail, hopes catching sufficient wind lead us current, breath air stirring. We possess thing compass; provisions calculated pleasure trip--we one small jar water, flask spirit, biscuits, two large cakes, chicken, dried fish. The land rapidly receding; I could mark position respect sun pouring burning rays upon little bark. If awning could endured it; heat oppressive. We obliged give rowing, much fatigue occasioned, hopelessness labour. We sat sinking hearts watching fast retreating land. It become point--it diminished speck, disappeared anxious sight, sun set his glory, drifting mercy current knew where, nothing sky sea around us. Chapter XLV Vainly I stretched eyes around illimitable field ocean, hope discerning indication power whose ships I told traversed every sea; nothing like vessel sight--the mighty waters stretched like endless desert every side. There sign man vast space, except little boat; comparison space, insignificant two helpless human beings sat silent motionless boat awaiting destiny. The stars came marvellous brilliancy. I fancied I never seen appear bright; probably gloominess thoughts made look brighter contrast. I seemed centre glorious system worlds revolving calm tranquil beauty, appeared reproach giving way despair scene lovely. The great mass water, scarcely moved ripple, appeared lit countless fires, purplish haze, like low flame, visible every direction. I directed attention companion strange appearance. Notwithstanding intensity her anxiety, she immediately entered explanation phenomenon, attributed peculiarly phosphoric state sea, caused myriads creatures possess quality glow-worm, rising surface water, made latter seem though enveloped flame. I sat long time watching singular appearances presented whenever I dashed oar. It looked though I beating fire instead water, flame seemed come oar drops fell sea. In way hours passed by: still floating current; moon stars coldly shining heads; ocean around us still gleaming phosphoric fires, Mrs Reichardt advised take nourishment, endeavour go sleep, saying she would keep watch apprise anything happened might advantageous avail ourselves. The thing I desired appearance vessel, setting breeze, present sign existed. I felt disinclined either eat drink: I proposed companion make meal go sleep, much proper I keep watch herself. The fact was, anxious first diminish little stock food; neither would induced this, decided provisions divided certain portions, taken sunrise sunset, night relieve every three hours keeping watch, saw land, ship, wind spring up, might consult immediately course. I succeeded inducing her lie bottom boat, obtain little sleep, previously her taking place I might rest myself. She first said her usual prayers evening, I joined, minutes I glad hear her regular breathing, she obtaining repose I certain she stood greatly need. I sole observer stupendous spectacle spread around sublime feature imposing scene appeared silence reigned supreme all. The heavens mute sea. It looked earth engulfed second deluge, living nature perished utterly face it. I felt deep feeling melancholy stealing me: could forbear reproaching embarking hazardous enterprise, risking life I bound preserve. What could become us I knew not--but I sensible speedily picked up, made friendly shore, existed little hopes surviving many days. I made mind island never see again, though I anxious many years quit it, fate separated us ever, I could console loss home endeared many recollections. But great grief loss grandfather's diamonds. He chance restored him. If found would become property discoverer; he would never know his daughter perished rock, his grandson swallowed waters great deep. And I thought glorious England I long hoped see, heart sunk within I gazed upon boundless prospect. There voice murmur consolation, hand offer assistance. Was I never see white cliffs often described me, I could call mind clearly stood pride beauty eyes? How often I dreamed approaching hallowed shores England--how often I heard cheerful voices her people welcoming Little Savage his natural home--how often I embraced aged grandfather, received happy circle his friends, respect affection due his heir. I dreamed happy dreams, seen blissful visions; result starvation open boat illimitable ocean. Mrs Reichardt still slept, I would wake her. As long she insensible dangers her position she must exist comparative happiness; disturb her bring her back sense danger misery, recollection folly brought her hopeless state. I noticed small cloud making appearance horizon, almost instant I observed it, I felt breeze sufficient flap sail mast. In minutes cloud greatly increased, wind filled sail. I fancied blew direction contrary current; belief I soon got boat round, great joy she presently scudding wind rate sensibly increasing. But cloud presently began envelop heavens, thick darkness spread like veil every direction. The wind blew fresh, strained mast sail fixed; I began entertain new fear: sudden gust might take sail capsize us, tear fastenings. I would gladly taken sail, I considered rather hazardous experiment. Mrs Reichardt lay position prevented getting without disturbing her, running risk tipping boat over, would sure fill immediately, sink us both. Though could swim, I felt assured water, would remain little chance protracting lives beyond hours. The boat, therefore, continued run wind rapid rate, slight mast creaking, sail stretching tight, I expected every minute upset. At moment Mrs Reichardt awoke, her quick eye immediately took full extent her danger. "We shall lost," she said hurriedly, "if take sail!" I fully aware this, she seen sailor's perils I had, knew better meet them. She offered assist taking sail, directing careful, proceeded, assistance awning, mast, good deal labour, risk blown sea, succeeded furling sail, unshipping mast. We quite much danger another because--the surface sea, smooth calm, violently agitated wind, boat kept ascending one great billow descend trough another. We often went almost perpendicularly, height seemed every moment increasing; every time went thus plunging headlong boiling waters, I thought engulfed never rise; nevertheless, next minute, ascended crest fearful wave hitherto encountered, plunged dark unfathomable abyss that, walled foaming mountains water, appeared yawning close us ever. It almost entirely dark; could see white foam wave pass; save this, black black above, impenetrable darkness around. Mrs Reichardt sat close her hand mine--she uttered exclamations feminine terror--she awe-struck frightened. I believe she fully satisfied her last hour come, I could hear her murmuring prayer she commended her soul her Creator. I cannot say I great degree alarmed--the rapid motion boat gave sensation pleasure I never experienced. To say truth, I greatly enjoyed thus mercy winds waves, midst black stormy night trackless ocean, constant thoughts companion, bitter self-reproaches led her terrible danger. I now, however, called reflections, necessity active employment. The boat I found shipped water every plunge, speedy means taken keep water under, little doubt she would soon fill go down. I therefore seized iron kettle brought us cook dinner, began rapidly bailing water, already ankles. We continued ship water, sometimes sometimes less; Mrs Reichardt, actuated doubt motives myself, tin pan assisted getting rid treacherous element. By united exertions kept water under, hoped able get rid whole it. About time began rain heavily, although awning protected heads, much fell boat, notwithstanding labours continued sit pool. We were, however, glad find rain fell wind abated, latter subsided, sea became less violent, shipped less water. I able exertions keep boat tolerably dry, Mrs Reichardt, ever provident, spread empty vessels she brought her catch rain, she said, know valuable water might become short time. The rain continued pour perfect torrent several hours; end sky gradually cleared. The sea, though still rough, presented none mountainous waves short time threatened annihilate us every descent, sufficient breeze waft us along brisk rate assistance sail. Mrs Reichardt helped putting mast, directly began feel breeze, she insisted taking refreshment. It vitally necessary both, labours heavy several hours. We therefore ate sparingly provisions, washed meal pannikin water mingled little spirit. Chapter XLVI The morning dawned upon boundless expanse sea. The first object presented sight enormous whale spouting water quarter mile distant me; I observed another, third, subsequently, several more; presented singular picturesque appearance, one vast animals continually throwing column water caught rays sun, looked beautiful distance. I looked vain land; I looked equally vain ship; nothing visible shoal whales, Mrs Reichardt endeavoured cheer describing importance whale fishery England, perils men meet pursue fish purpose wounding iron instrument called harpoon. I felt much interest details; companion went whole history whaling expedition, describing first discovery huge fish ship; pursuit boats, harpooning whale; struggles wounded; towed ship's side; subsequent manufacture oil blubber animal, preparation whalebone. In attending discourse, I completely forgot I tossed open sea, I knew where; I might short time would proved I equally ignorant: perhaps I corpse floating surface ocean waiting tomb till shark came way; perhaps I suffering torments hunger thirst; perhaps cast lifeless upon rock, bleached bones would remain monument would declare existed latitudes Little Savage. Where could island I, though long anxious quit, thousand times desirous beholding? I felt nothing could agreeable glimpse wild rocky coast often appeared walls intolerable prison. I strained eyes vain every direction; line horizon stretched uninterrupted single break kind around. Where could be? I often asked myself; except wide ocean, neither companion slightest idea geographical position. We must blown considerable distance storm: much farther current taken us island. I calculated must passed many mile continued course; wind shifted several times, might long sail it, could gain slightest knowledge direction found. But hopeless. I felt assured must abandon idea seeing again. In midst painful reflections, companion directed attention object considerable distance, intimated her impression ship. Luckily, I brought glass me, soon anxiously directing required point. It ship: great distance impossible, Mrs Reichardt said, person board distinguish boat. I would sailed direction, wind contrary: I had, therefore, alternative wait till ship approach near enough make us out; I passed several hours deepest anxiety watching course distant vessel. She increased size, I could observe she large ship unassisted eye; running wind totally different direction, seemed little chance communicating, unless she altered her course. Mrs Reichardt mentioned signals made vessels distance attract other's attention, described various ways communicated wishes respective captains. The signal I habit making burning quantities wood shore pouring water make smoke--this impossible boat. My companion last suggested I tie table-cloth mast; peculiar whiteness might attract attention. The sail presently taken in, table-cloth spread place; but, unfortunately, soon afterwards came dead calm--the breeze died away, cloth hung long folds mast. No notice whatever taken us. We took oars pulled direction ship; several hours' hard rowing, strength suffered previous fatigues, seemed made little distance. In short time sun set, watched object hopes anxious eyes, till night set hid her sight. Shortly afterwards light breeze sprung up; renewed hope gave sail wind, bore us contrary direction, morning dawned saw ship. The wind shifted, bore us briskly along. But where? I fallen asleep preceding night, wearied labour anxiety, I wake till long daybreak. Mrs Reichardt would disturb me. In sleep I insensible miseries dangers position. She could bring herself disturb repose necessary mind body; I fell sweet dream new home dear England I prayed often see; bright faces smiled upon me, voices welcomed me, full tenderness affection. I fancied one faces I recognised mother, whose love I early deprived, paler others, infinitely tender affectionate: countenance seemed grow paler paler, till took upon likeness fair creature I buried guano, I thought she embraced me, her arms cold stone, she pressed her lips mine, gave chill blood made shake ague. Suddenly I beheld Jackson his sightless orbs groping towards knife his hand, muttering imprecations, he caught hold me, desperate struggle, he plunged long knife chest, loud laugh derision malice; I felt blade enter flesh, I gave start jumped up, alarmed Mrs Reichardt wild cry I awoke. How strongly dream impressed upon mind; features different persons figured it--how distinctly brought me! My poor mother fresh recollection though I seen her yesterday, sweetness her looks she approached me--how I tried recall them, feasted memory though lost blessing. Then nameless corpse washed wreck, strange seemed, lapse time she appear dream, though long attached other, her affections life entirely own. Poor girl! Perhaps even devoted lover mourns her loss; hopes distant date able join her new colony, attain cruel destiny forced her his arms. Little he dream her nameless grave guano. Little he dream colony he likely join her settlement great desert oblivion, Death remained governor birth world. But unpleasant part vision appearance Jackson; long time I could bring believe I beheld his well known features--that I stabbed him, I suffering mortal wound he inflicted. I however last shook delusion, Mrs Reichardt's anxious inquiries replied I disagreeable dream. In short time I began doubt whether waking pleasant dreaming--the vast ocean still spread like mighty winding sheet, fair sky, beautiful appeared rays morning sun, I could regard pall--and little bark coffin two helpless human beings, though still existing, waiting interment. "Has God abandoned us?" I asked companion, "or He forgotten two his creatures deepest peril lives, He alone save them?" "Hush! Frank Henniker," exclaimed Mrs Reichardt solemnly; "this impious. God never abandons worthy His protection. He either save His appointed time--or He think desirable, snatch scene many dangers surround them, place prevails eternal tranquillity, everlasting bliss. "We rather rejoice," she added, increasing seriousness, "that thought worthy early taken world met many troubles." "But die way," I observed gloomily; "to left linger days terrible torture, without hope relief--I cannot reconcile it." "We must die sooner later," she said, "and many diseases fatal protracted suffering agonising description. These spared. The wretch lingers torment, visited loathsome disorder, would envy us, could he see comparatively easy manner suffered leave existence. "But I see hopelessness case," she added. "It yet impossible may picked ship, discover friendly shore whence might obtain passage England." "I see prospect this," said I; "we apparently track ships, chance discover one, people board likely observe us. I wish I never left island." Mrs Reichardt never reproached me--never much reminded fault. She merely added, "It God." We ate drank small rations--my companion always blessing meal, offering thanksgiving permitted enjoy it. I noticed left. We extremely economical, yet barely enough another day. We determined still reduce trifling portion allowed ourselves, might increase chance escape. Chapter XLVII Five days nights drifting mercy winds waves; small stock food devoured--though hoarded every crumb, miser hoards his gold. Even rain water, well water brought us, drained last drop. The weather continually alternated dead calm light breeze: wind frequently shifted, I strength left attend sail--the boat abandoned guidance, rather wind. When becalmed lay still--when breeze sprang pursued course till sail longer felt influence. Five long days nights--days intolerable suffering, nights inexpressible horror. From sunrise sunset I strained eyes along line horizon, nothing sky wave ever met gaze. When became dark, excited deep anxiety I endured throughout day, I could sleep. I fancied I beheld darkness monstrous forms mocking gibbering, high reared head enormous python I combated Happy Valley. And he opened his tremendous jaws, though swallow me, displayed fold upon fold his immense form involve crush boat mighty involutions. I always glad day dawned, night happened fair starlight; spectres vanished sun shone, tranquil beauty stars calmed soul. I famishing want food--but I suffered want water, heat day tremendous, I became frantic thirst, nothing exhortations Mrs Reichardt would prevented dashing sea, drinking fill salt water looked tempting refreshing. My companion sought encourage hope, long hope vanished--then she preached resignation Divine Will, her nature gave practical commentary her text. I perceived her voice getting faint--and she becoming hourly feeble. She able move her seat, last asked assist her lie bottom boat. Then I noticed she prayed fervently, I could often distinguish name petitions throne Grace. I felt strange sensation head, tongue became mouth dry stick--from I relieved chewing sleeve shirt; head grew worse. My eyes affected strange manner. I continually fancied I saw ships sailing little distance me, I strove attract attention calling them. My voice weak I could create kind half stifled cry. Then I thought I beheld land: fair forests green pastures spread me--bright flowers refreshing fruits grew around--and I called companion make haste running ashore presently pulling clustering grapes lay among odorous flowers. Mrs Reichardt opened her eyes gazed painful interest. She knew I haunted chimeras created famine thirst; she seemed lost power speech. She motioned join her prayer; I, however, much occupied prospect landing, paid attention her signs. Presently bright landscape faded away, I beheld nothing wide expanse water, circle appeared expand spread sky, sky seemed lost broken water, minutes mixed together wildest strangest confusion. Subsequently I must dropt asleep, I found huddled corner boat, must fallen seat. I stared time, unconscious I was. The bright sun still shone head; everlasting sea still rolled beneath feet. I looked bottom boat, met upturned gaze fellow voyager--the pale face grown paler, expression painful eye become less intelligent. I thought she I seen her dream, she changed her likeness poor drowned girl buried guano. I turned away gaze--the sight painful look upon. I felt assured she dying, short space time, faithful affectionate nature I must part forever. I thought I would make last effort. Though faint trembling, burning fever, feeling deadly sick, I managed support awning crawl mast, embracing one arm I raised glass hand, looked carefully about. My hand unsteady eyes seemed dim. I could discern nothing water. I sunk despair bottom boat, I attracted moment singular appearance sky. A cloud approaching shape appearance I never observed before. I raised glass again, observing cloud time great attention, I felt assured I considered long lines vapour immense flock birds. This discovery interested me--I forgot intensity sufferings observing motions apparently endless flock. As first file approached, I looked again, see I could make were. God heaven! They gannets. I crawled back companion rapidly feeble limbs would allow, inform her discovery I made. Alas! I found I unheeded. I could believe her fine spirit fled; no, she moved her hand; dull spiritless gaze seemed warn her dissolution fast approaching. I looked spirit flask, found drops still left there; I poured her mouth, watched result deepest anxiety I ever known since day birth. In minutes I found she breathed regularly distinctly--presently her eyes lost fixedness made painful look upon. Then she recognised me, took hold hand, regarding sweet smile I familiar. As soon I found consciousness returned, I told her great flock gannets evidently wending way customary resting place, hope I entertained could kept sight, wind remained quarter, boat might led place laid eggs. She listened attention, evidently understood I said. Her lips moved, I thought she returning thanks God--accepting flight birds manifest proof He still watching us. In minutes she seemed much better she could sit up. I noticed her time watching gannets approached one vast cloud threatened shut us sky--she turned her gaze opposite direction, smile exultation lit her wan face glory, stretched her arm out, pointing her hand distant portion sea. My gaze quickly followed hers, I fancied I discovered break line horizon; look like ship. I pointed glass direction, felt joyful assurance within sight land. This additional discovery gave increased strength: rather hope dawning upon us, gave impulse I felt before. I turn became consoler. I encouraged Mrs Reichardt, arguments I master, think soon safety. She smiled, something like animation appeared her pale features. If I could save her, I felt I blessed beyond measure. Such object worth striving for; I strive. I know I gained strength I day; I felt I supported On High, speck land she first discovered gradually enlarged approached it, exertions secure speedy rescue companion jaws death, continued increase. The breeze remained fair scudded along spanking rate, gannets keeping us company way--evidently bound shore. I kept talking Mrs Reichardt, endeavouring raise her spirits cheering description got ashore, God would sure direct us place might without difficulty recover strength. Hitherto she spoken, soon began distinguish features shore approaching she unclosed her lips, triumphant smile played around them. "Frank Henniker, know rock?" "No!--yes!--can possible? O gracious Providence watching us!" It rock remarkable shape stood short distance fishing-pool. It could otherwise, gannets led us old haunts. We approaching island. I looked companion--she praying. I immediately joined her thanks-giving signal mercy vouchsafed us, little hour priceless satisfaction carrying her shore cottage, carefully nursed till recovered effects dreadful cruise. Chapter XLVIII My numerous pursuits, I stated preceding chapter obliging constant occupation, kept useless repining destiny, obliged live many years far-distant corner earth, I long ceased look passing ships--I scarcely ever thought them, given speculations grandfather's reception me. I rarely went sea, except fish, never cared trouble anything beyond limited space become inheritance. The reader, then, may judge surprise when, one sultry day, I busily engaged several hours cutting field wheat, Mrs Reichardt came running astounding news ship island, boat full people left her, rowing towards rocks. I hastily took glass she brought her, soon I could get convenient position, threw ground rock, reconnoitred glass appearance new comers. I soon noticed part well armed, case rest, pinioned manner could scarcely move hand foot. We concealed lying lengths grass. As boat approached, I could discern unarmed party belonged superior class men, many others countenances prepossess favour. We lay hid long grass, could command view approaching visitors. "I think I understand this," whispered Mrs Reichardt. "There mischief here." "Had I better run home get arms?" I asked. "No," she replied, "you better not. If able good, must stratagem. Let us watch movements, act great caution." My companion's advice was, I saw, wisest could pursued; therefore remained hiding places, narrowly observing visitors approached. They entered fishing-pool, I could distinctly see hear them. To extreme surprise, one first men jumped boat John Gough, brought Mrs Reichardt island. He looked older, I recognised moment, companion. Her admonitory "Hush!" kept betraying place concealment--so great astonishment--having long believed his lawless associates lost sea. He well armed, evidently possessed authority; nevertheless, I thought I could detect air concern his features, he offered help one captives boat. The latter, however, regarded air disdain, and, though his hands tied behind him, leaped ashore without assistance. He man commanding stature, well bronzed face, look great energy character. He wore band gold lace round his cap, duck trousers, blue jacket waistcoat. "Come, captain!" exclaimed John Gough, "I bear malice. Though rather hard upon us, will not leave starve." "He is deuced deal better he desarves be," cried man boat, I recognised fellow I drawn knife hurting Nero. "If made walk plank, I proposed, I am blowed would not much purpose putting island, lots prog, everything calkilated make his domineering officers comfortable rest days." "Hold tongue, mutineering rascal," exclaimed captain angrily. "A rope's end yard-arm deserts long." "Thank ye kindly, captain," replied fellow, touching his hat mockery. "But must pleased remember I are not caught yet; means many jolly cruise ship, get end treasure, I shall think latter end; I means die like Christian, repent sins, make much edifying example I exhibit dangling end rope." The men laughed, captain muttered something "pirates mutineers," rest officers wisely held tongues. I noticed elderly man respectable appearance, pinioned like rest. His hair quite white, his complexion pale, he looked like one oppressed deep sorrow anxiety. He rose his seat boat, assisted John Gough. "I am sorry obliged leave here, Mr Evelyn," said Gough, "but see, sir, alternative. We could not keep us, many reasons; therefore obliged make sharer fate officers." "And werry painful feelings, sir, may believe," said another mutineers mockingly. "I am quite moloncholy I thinks it." The men laughed; person addressed walked side captain without making observation. The captives also left boat silence. They eight all, four evidently common seamen dress--the others officers. All well-made, strong men. "What precious pretty colony you will make, hearties!" exclaimed one mutineers, jeeringly, he helped land cask, packages, brought them. "It is thousand pities are not got female associates, might marry, settle, bring respectable families." "Talking women," cried one first spoken, "I wonder became one left cleverly wrecked place six years ago." John Gough looked uneasy inquiry, recollection agreeable him. "And Little Savage," continued fellow, "what agoing send his knife ribs summat other--I forget what. They must died long ago, I are not doubt, unfortnitely left  them nothing live upon." "No doubt died hand hand, like Babes Wood," said another. I still observed John Gough; he seemed distressed turn conversation taken. "Now, mates," he said hurriedly, "let us return ship. We done came do." "I votes shall go see arter Missionary's woman Little Savage," cried fourth. "I like, somehow, see whether living not, stroll ashore will not us harm." "I shall remain till return," said John Gough; he threw grass his back towards me, yards place concealed. The rest, making fast boat, started exploring expedition, direction old hut. Chapter XLIX The captives grouped together, sitting, standing. Not one looked dejected his fate; though I could see movements impatient bonds tied them. My attention frequently directed old gentleman addressed Mr Evelyn. Notwithstanding grief expressed his countenance, possessed air benevolence kindness heart even his settled melancholy conceal. I could understand why, I felt deeper interest person others--a sort yearning towards him, mingled desire protect malice his enemies. Almost soon gone, John Gough beckoned Mr Evelyn sit his side. Possibly done prevent his assisting his companions regain liberty, he, pinioned like rest, might easily done, might overpowered guard his companions could come his assistance. But Gough well armed, rest without weapons kind, scarcely probable would risked lives desperate attempt. Mr Evelyn came quietly sat place indicated. I observed increasing interest, singular relate, I gazed his venerable face, strongly I felt assured I seen before. This course impossible, nevertheless, fancy took possession me, I experienced strange sensation pleasure I watched changes his features underwent. "John Gough, I sorry see mixed miserable business," said he, mildly addressing his companion. The answer, his back turned towards I could observe effect observation upon him. "The men left us I know bad men," continued speaker; "I expect nothing wickedness them. But I aware better brought up. Your responsibility therefore becomes greater assisting villainy." "You better let hear you, Mr Evelyn," replied Gough, last, something like surly tone; "I would answer consequences." "Those I fear," answered. "The results transaction make little difference man verge grave, outlived his relatives, nothing left fall back upon memory his misfortunes: one prime life like yourself, boast friends relatives feel interest good name, results must serious indeed. What must feelings respectable father he learns joined gang pirates; intense must grief amiable mother she hears paid penalty must sooner later overtake embracing lawless life." "Come, Mr Evelyn," exclaimed Gough, though tremulousness his voice betrayed state his feelings, "you right preach me. I done much I could all. The men would made short work you, I interposed, pointed uninhabited island." "Where seems left poor woman starved death," continued Mr Evelyn. "It fault mine," replied man; "I I could prevent it." "It would manly remained her rock, left cowardly associates take selfish course. But weak irresolute, John Gough; easily persuaded evil, slow follow impulses good. The murder poor woman much deed blown her brains abandoned her. Indeed I know latter would less criminal." John Gough made answer. I think, however, his mind quite easy accusation, he seemed restless, kept playing his pistols, his eyes cast down. "Your complicity mutiny, too, John Gough, equally inexcusable," continued Mr Evelyn. "It duty stood Captain Manvers his officers, would earned eternal gratitude, handsome provision owners vessel." "It is use talking things now, Mr Evelyn," said Gough, hurriedly. "I taken course. It late turn back. Would God," he added, dashing his hand violently his brow, "I nothing it." "It never late, John Gough, good," cried Mrs Reichardt, she rose her place concealment, much surprise could observe her. But nothing could equal astonishment Gough he first caught sight her features;--he sprang his feet, leaving his pistols ground, clasping his hands together, exclaimed, "Thank God, she safe!" "Yes," she replied, approaching taking his hand kindly. "By interposition Providence, saved guilt one murder. In name God signally preserved yourself, I command abandon present wicked designs." The man hesitated, seemed he could take his gaze her face, evident her presence exerted extraordinary influence him. In meantime I made appearance scene, less astonishment lookers-on; first act take possession pair pistols Gough left ground; next hurry group captives, regarding us, state perfect bewilderment, American knife cut bonds. "I whatever think proper," said John Gough. "Believe I reluctantly led this, joined mutiny knowing I murdered I not." "You must endeavour make amends power," continued Mrs Reichardt, "by assisting officers recovering possession ship." "I gladly assist whatever may think feasible," said man. "But must first secure desperate fellows left us, poorly provided weapons, service slight danger. To get possession ship I afraid still hazardous; shall find front every danger." Here Captain Manvers others came John Gough Mrs Reichardt conversing; he heard Gough's last speech, he going say something, I interposed stating time explanations, minutes fellows gone hut would return, way prepare whole party go house, Mrs Reichardt would lead them, would find plenty arms ammunition. In meantime I would keep watch, observe motions, firing one pistols would signal I danger. Lastly, I recommended oars removed boat, prevent mutineers making escape ship. My appearance discourse attracted general attention. I particularly noticed Mr Evelyn started soon he caught sight me, appeared observe singular carefulness; that, doubt, arose unexpected address, strange way I presented him. The Captain approving proposal, whole party, taking away boat's oars, moved rapidly direction house. I concealed grass, waited return mutineers. They remain away long. I could hear approaching, laughed shouted went along loud enough heard considerable distance. When began descend rocks, passed close me, I could hear every word spoken. "Well, flesh grass, parson says," said Jack; "they must died sooner later, had not parted company little ceremony. But, hallo! eyes limbs! Where is John Gough? Where is captain? Where is  them?" It impossible express astonishment men reaching spot lately left prisoners, discovering trace seen. At first imagined escaped boat, soon saw boat safe, gave idea. Then fancied John Gough taken prisoners stroll little distance inland, began shout loud lungs would permit them. Receiving response, uttered many strange ejaculations, I could understand, I since learned profane oaths; seemed loss do, whether wander island search them, return ship. Only one chanced former, others overruled him, thinking worth take much trouble go rambling strange place. They seemed bent taking boat, one suggested might get scrape returned without companion. They finally resolved sitting waiting his return. Presently, one complained he sleepy, he busy mutineering turn his hammock previous night, others acknowledged also felt equal want rest because. Each began yawn. They laid full length along grass, short time I could hear snoring, Jackson used do, asleep. I crept stealthily towards hands knees, profound sleep, I difficulty whatever removing pistols belts. I succeeded this, I beheld captain, John Gough, Mr Evelyn, rest them, well armed guns pistols, approaching place were. In minutes afterwards mutineers made prisoners, without opportunity making slightest resistance. I much complimented captain dexterity I disarmed them; I conversation him, impossible express surprise I felt, seeing Mr Evelyn suddenly rush towards side Mrs Reichardt, he talking, and, embracing moving demonstrations affection, claim his grandson. The mystery soon explained. Mr Evelyn met many losses business merchant, he took opportunity son his old clerk--who become captain fine ship, employed South American trade--being proceed trading voyage part world, sail his vessel consignment goods South American market. He also another object, inquire fate his long-lost daughter son-in-law, he received certain intelligence, since latter took ship diamonds he purchased return home. The vessel sailed never heard since; Mr Evelyn long given hopes seeing either again, valuable property entrusted. On going house, he asked Mrs Reichardt name, stating I strongly resembled dear friend his, he believed perished many years ago, he felt quite interest me. The answer he received led series earnest inquiries, Mrs Reichardt satisfied every point, showed property formerly possession Mrs Henniker her husband: related Jackson's story, convinced him, though he lost daughter he mourned long, her representative existed Little Savage, saving fate he preserved mutineers. I add, I happiness restoring grandfather diamonds I obtained Jackson, doubt welcome him, restored affluence, made one richest merchants upon Change. I also instrumental obtaining captain command his ship, restoring discipline amongst crew. The ringleaders mutiny thrown irons, taken home trial; resulted one two hanged way example, happened men barbarously deserted Mrs Reichardt. She accompanied England Captain Manvers's vessel, he heard obligations I owed her, grandfather decided she remain us long she lived. We however leave island shown grandfather, captain, his officers, effected stay, every one surprised could produced flourishing farm upon barren rock. I fail show places I fight python, I pursued sharks, narrative incidents seemed astonish hearers exceedingly. I must forget add, day departure, John Gough came privately, requested good offices captain, he might left island. He become different character he previously been; could question repentance he assumed sincere, I said I could him. My recommendation successful, I transferred John Gough farm, farming stock, agricultural implements; moreover, promised send whatever he might require make his position comfortable. He expressed great gratitude, desired nothing; his family might know he well off, likely return. Perhaps John Gough like risk he ran tried mutiny, averse sailing his former comrades; whatever his resolution, certain he remained behind ship left island, may hour I know contrary. We made quick voyage England, readers doubt glad hear, Little Savage landed safely Plymouth, soon cordially welcomed his grandfather's house London. THE END.
