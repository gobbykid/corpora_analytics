Her Majesty's corvette _Dragon_, lately commanded old friend Jack Rogers, superseded Commander Rawson, her passage across wide Pacific, bound Esquimault harbour, Vancouver's Island, Japan, she sent despatches. The wind fair, screw rest, she sail, looking trim taunt little man-of-war sailor's heart could desire. Her stay Japan short, leave granted, even officers seen little country people; though, hoped return long, much matter. As great importance _Dragon_ soon get back Vancouver's Island, Commander Rawson received directions visit Ladrone Islands, somewhat southward his course, order obtain particulars outrage, said committed English subject mongrel inhabitants islands, centuries belonged Spain. The smooth sea shone brightly rays sun, undimmed cloud mist. In directions snowy wings sea fowl could seen, dipping towards ocean, rising blue ether, showing land great distance. As wind northward, air cool, though shady side ship generally sought watch deck, except whose heads seemed impervious hot rays tropical sun. Two midshipmen slowly pacing port side quarter-deck, feet shade afforded shelter heat. The one, somewhat short, well-knit lad, open countenance, well tanned, blue laughing eyes, his whole appearance giving promise strength activity; other, tall youth sandy hair, pleasant features well freckled. Though tall, he well built called lanky, showed he possessed strength activity. "I say, Archie, I envy fellows _Eolus_ going China; see sorts fun, Celestials sure give hurry. The _Eoluses_ sort work brother Jack cousin Murray went last Chinese war, midshipmen." The speaker Tom Rogers, youngest brother Captain Jack Rogers; his companion Archie Gordon, Captain Alick Murray's cousin. "Gerald dreadfully cut able remain board _Eolus_, instead come back us return home; Captain Adair's letter peremptory, and, newspapers say, I hope he hear something his advantage. Gerald would better pleased his uncle let know he sent for." "He great complain, seeing climate China none delectable, he would run risk shot bargain," observed Archie. "I wish I chance going home, finding possessor tidy fortune title." "But there is honour glory, fun, pig-tails captured, loot, chance serving naval brigade seeing work shore, _Shannon's_ people India, fair prospect promotion end it." "If body happens shot, ye ken," observed Archie, who, though every bit eager Tom sort work he described, took pleasure differing opinion whenever he could. "We not, however, bother poor Desmond subject he well again," said Tom. "I really believe he fell sick vexation, though he happy enough us more." "He much better to-day," remarked Archie, "and I hope to-morrow doctor let come deck again, although he may fit duty day two more." Mr Mildmay, first lieutenant, officer watch, paced deck, spyglass hand, going bridge sweeping horizon his glass, he frequently called look-outs forecastle fore-yardarm keep eyes open. Jos Green, master, also continually there, else consulting chart his cabin, part ocean comparatively little known, cruel reefs might exist, marked down. "The first lieutenant master seem fidgety," remarked Tom. "So would be, I suspect, responsibility navigating ship rested us," answered Archie. "After all, one suffers sufficiently careful; that is rule cousin gave I first came sea." "And good rule is, too, doubt that," observed Tom. "My brother Jack careful his ship, everything connected her, old lady her best silk gown Sunday morning, though one, hear talk, would suppose he harum-scarum fellow alive, always excepting his old shipmate, Captain Adair. He is, however, staid steady enough reality. I glad hear he got his post rank time brother Jack did; three old messmates, delight call themselves, post-captains, day, I hope, admirals. I wish, however, wait long. Your grave cousin Murray fit admiral he twenty years hence, and, unless fine fellows die off, take best part time get flag." "It encouragement us, though," observed Archie; "for posted without great amount interest, may hope get promoted consequence good conduct." "Yes, remember seen great deal service, piping times peace return, may find hard matter get employed able exhibit good conduct." "Weel, mon, we will hope best, may nation kindly think fit come fisticuffs old England, give us something do," said Archie. "There is every chance that, I think," said Tom. Just seven bells struck afternoon watch. "I will go see Gerald getting on, I come deck again; it is dull work lying himself." Tom found his old messmate, whose cot slung little way outside berth, he might advantage air coming after-hatchway, sucking lustily orange he grasped one hand, he held book other. He absorbed perusal he notice Tom. Suddenly he burst loud fit laughter. "Capital fun; I liked seen it!" he exclaimed; "soused head ears second time. Ah, ah, ah!" "What is joke?" asked Tom. "I have got old Peregrine Wiffle tumbles water second time, he showing he saw small fish playing wharf, picked boat-hook." Tom Gerald good laugh together. "You do not seem bad," observed Tom. "No; fever, whatever was, got hold me, cut stick, though I do not feel quite nimble I ought be," answered Gerald. "I believe disappointment going China, thinking uncle Terence want home for, climate, hot sun, anything else, I intend ask doctor let go deck to-morrow, time I shall finished book, I want look islands may happen pass. There curious shaped ones, I told." "Yes; sighted some. One seemed rise three four hundred feet pointed peak, right water, not, I say, eighth mile circumference. It marked chart Lot's wife. A solitary existence she must lead herself." "Whereabouts we?" asked Desmond. "At noon, passing curious rock, latitude 29 degrees north, longitude 14 degrees east. We shall next sight Bonin Islands, Rosario, another lofty island, little rock, standing sea." "Do ask doctor I may get up, Tom; I sorry pass places without look them," exclaimed Desmond. "I finish book by-and-by." Just officer spoken of, Mr Hussey, came gun-room. He short, somewhat stout gentleman, good-natured expression countenance, merry twinkle eye, showed he could enjoy joke, likely utter many one himself. His naturally florid complexion deepened still ruddy hue exposure hot suns tropics. "Do, doctor, let get up; physic done immense deal good, I feel quite well already," said Desmond. The doctor felt his pulse. "You get up!" he exclaimed. "What think made of?" trying look grave. "Arrah, shure, sugar spice that is nice! that is midshipmen made of. But shure, doctor dear, keep here, stewing myself, I might enjoying pure air heaven?--for I really well, doctor." "You mean say finished book, got tired lying bed," reply. "Well, promise good boy keep shade, may dress go deck, I cannot undertake scratch sick-list yet." "Thank you, sir," said Desmond; "I everything tell me, take much medicine think fit prescribe. I want duty yet, I have got hundred pages `Tom Cringle's Log' read, I cannot gallop book people do." "Well, well, possibly ship may manage take care without you," said doctor, he passed on. Whereupon Desmond began put his clothes, task he accomplished Tom's assistance. He felt himself, however, much weaker he expected, he made his way upon deck, though he tried hard show he again. He received friendly greeting his messmates, Mr Mildmay congratulated able make his appearance. There plenty amuse taste natural history even land sight, doctor, great naturalist, constantly _qui vive_, sea teemed squid, medusae, polypi, flying-fish. Several latter came ports, general scramble them, midshipmen, watch active, coming largest share. A short time afterwards unhappy fish made appearance, well fried, mess-table. Whales, too, sporting directions, tempted locality abundance food before-named creatures afforded. Several old whalers among crew could scarcely restrain impatience, and, could obtained leave, would gone gear could prepared attack monsters deep. Since _Dragon_ left Japan, weather remarkably fine, calms light winds. But calms lasted scarcely long enough fires lighted ship sail. That evening, however, long heavy swell began come north-east; undulations rapidly increasing size, making ship roll side side, her chains touched water. Desmond, common two three his messmates, ship's boys marines, began feel uncomfortable. "What is going happen?" he asked; "I am mighty quare region stomach." "I suppose going gale wind, change," answered Tom, never ill since he first came sea. "We shall shorten sail, I have notion, long, prepared blustering Boreas, he thinks fit visit us." The whole appearance sky sea quickly changed. The wildfowl, hovering around ship, winged flight nearest islands shelter could found. The atmosphere pervaded peculiar glare rays sun coming clouds dull ochreous red, giving ocean, ship, her canvas sides, unnatural tint. As summits swells, till smooth glass, rose higher higher, formed crests foam, sparkled ruddy light, like masses jewels. Hitherto sufficient wind steady ship she made her way amid heaving billows. Mr Jay, second lieutenant, officer watch; he made sign Tom. "Rogers," he said, "go tell commander weather getting much worse." "Be quick it, too," exclaimed Green; "there time lose." Commander Rawson quickly deck. After taking rapid glance round, he shouted out, "All hands shorten sail." The watch came tumbling deck. The topsails lowered, topmen, like bees, swiftly swarmed aloft, laying yardarms. "Hold teeth eyelids, Billy," said Tom his old friend Billy Blueblazes, he sprang his station main-top. The canvas speedily reduced closely-reefed fore main-topsails fore-staysail. It hard work hold on, ship rolled even violently before. The wind, however, come soon expected, impossible say moment might strike her. That would come ordinary strength, without warning, every reason believe. The crew, performed task, called deck. There something appearance sea sky, heaviness atmosphere, made even toughest old seaman feel extraordinary depression spirits, though he might suspected because. "Faith! I am sorry I remain quietly cot," said Desmond; "it seems world coming end. I surprised see flames spouting sea. It looks big fires burning away it." "Do not ken, Gerald, water would putting fire out," observed Archie; "though appearance islands fire enough one time other. They raised ocean volcanic agency." "I disposed dispute truth remark," said Desmond; "I wish sea would get quiet, let us glide comfortably it, instead kicking disturbance." While midshipmen speaking, ship continued her uneasy course, slowly rising summit huge billow gliding deep trough. Suddenly loud roar heard, seemed mighty monster deep struck prodigious blow side ship. Over she heeled water rushed her lee ports. "Up helm. Furl main-topsail. Take another reef fore-topsail. We must run it," cried commander, hoping steer clear islands reefs might ahead. The ship quickly rose even keel, dashed forward amid foaming seas, rolling, however, even violently before. So rapidly waves follow, many struck her stern; not, however, her dead lights closed. So tremendous blows, seemed her masts would shaken her. The doctor purser, sitting gun room, thrown seats sprawling table, fully believing ship struck rock, hands would soon struggling lives. As soon things could got rights, Tom helped Desmond below, he glad enough turn his hammock, he anxious quit. "Shure got Harry Cane aboard us, Mr Rogers," observed Tim Nolan, Tom's watch, took liberty old shipmate address his officer freedom others would ventured. They stationed together forecastle, looking ahead. "I wish gentleman would good enough take off, then," answered Tom, "or he may playing us scurvy trick, sending craft ugly reefs abound hereabouts." "We will keeping bright look-out that, sir," said Tim. "We may reef see it," observed Tom. "For part, I believe Providence steering us, I comfortable." The ship continued drive gale. The second lieutenant came forward, he confess his eyes little value pierce dark gloom ahead. The foam-crested waves could alone seen, rapidly rising falling. Tom's eyes ached. He sorry he relieved. Still, neither he one else felt inclined go below; one could tell might happen. The thick clouds hung like dark canopy, apparently masts' heads. The thunder, rumbling distance, began roar loudly, flashes forked lightning came zig-zagging air, threatening every instant strike ship. But, though played round sides, none touched her. The commander ordered fires got up, ship might steam, ready emergency. Hour hour typhoon continued howl even fiercely first. Frequently blast would strike ship, making her tremble solid mass hurled her. Then would come lull seconds, another blast would suddenly strike her way made every plank shake throughout her frame. Even hardy board wished day. The morning light brought abatement gale. Onward went ship, plunging vast hollow, threatened engulf her; she rose rapidly top another sea, either side appeared vying other, could leap highest accomplish her destruction. The officers gathered aft, men waist, holding firmly stanchions, anything could secure themselves. Each time ship plunged her head seas, masts bent, every moment would go board. At length lull came, commander, consulted Green, fearing dangers ahead, determined bring ship to, operation attended considerable risk, sea striking her moment might sweep her deck. A favourable opportunity waited for. The crew stood ready lower fore-topsail hoist main-topsail, closely reefed. Both tasks accomplished; officers anxiously watching seas ship rode them, happily she safely rounded to, lay her main-topsail mast, though scarcely she got position, fierce foam-crested sea, roaring up, struck her bows deluged her decks, shaking herself clear, like thing life, she sprang forward, water rushed ports. The lull continued, many hoped gale breaking; less hour another furious squall struck ship, nearly laid her her beam ends. Once she rose, her stout canvas stood severe trial put, she rode comparative ease minutes. The seas, however, seemed become broken ever. A prodigious one came roaring towards weather bow. The _Dragon_ appeared see her danger, struggled avoid it, next instant she pitched headlong deep hollow, another monstrous wave, rising apparently half high foretop, fell completely her deck. For seconds, her commander his officers feared she would never rise. No orders could issued, nothing could done. The crew stood silently stations, uttering word, showing felt fearful predicament placed. The ship remained, were, fixed sea; sudden jerk she burst her way it, her stout bowsprit broken short off, next sea threw wreck across forecastle. The commander's voice heard tones vying howling gale. The crew, obedient his orders, rushed forward secure bowsprit lashings; boatswain, another gang, lost moment setting fresh stays, prevent foremast carried away. This, loss one boats, forepart bulwarks stove in, chief damages hitherto received _Dragon_ gale. It over, however. Again sun set, wind continued rage unabated fury. The watch ordered turn in, officers done so, and, though tired out, still remained deck. Tom Archie standing aft, close together, latter suddenly grasped Tom arm. "Oh, mon! what is that?" he exclaimed, pointing main-topmast head, appeared crowned ball pale fire. "It curious appearance; though I never saw before, brother Jack told it. It sort Jack-of-lantern, Will-of-the-wisp, or, Gerald called it, `Saint Vitus' dance.' I believe he meant say Saint Elmo's fire." While midshipmen gazing up, flame descended rapidly mast, running first along main topgallant yardarm, returning, came, main-topsail yard, glided extreme end. Here rested seconds, made mind next do. Presently back came mast, darted lee yardarm. It yet finished journey. Once gliding back, ascended mast, made way main-topmast stay, foremast went gliding backwards forwards along yard. "I wish would come deck, might chance catching it," said Tom. "I read somewhere man going aloft bucket, clapped light, brought prisoner. It sort gas driven air finds something rest on. Why goes moving curious way I do not know, anybody else, I believe. I wish doctor deck,--he would tell us." "Shall I call him?" asked Archie. "I do not think he would thank you," said Tom. "Let rest quiet; perhaps he get his clothes fire disappeared." Tom right. In another minute luminous ball, gathering point, shot upwards vanished. "That is good sign," heard Green observe first lieutenant; "we shall gale breaking long." Before watch hurricane sensibly decreased, showing master right his prognostication. The sea continued, however, tumble ship terribly morning dawned, clouds began disperse, sun rose appeared fly his burning rays. By noon sky perfectly clear, when, observation taken, commander determined run lee one Bonin Islands, sighted shortly afterwards. Steam got up, vessel made rapid way, though she continued roll considerably, moved glass-like swell, still came north-east, showing that, although calm rested waters she was, storm raged another part ocean. Several islands seen rising water port bow, _Dragon_ drew near trees could distinguished hills, showing barren appeared distance. Rounding southern end one them, she went half speed, feeling her way lead she opened sheltered bay two high projecting points. Running she brought within quarter mile shore perfectly still water. Everybody glad enough rest tumbling last days. They allowed, however, enjoy many minutes' quiet; hands speedily set work repair damages. "We thankful escaped easily," observed Archie Gordon, surveying shore his telescope. "Look there, Tom, tall trees stretched ground roots air; must taken pretty hard blow break down. I see stumps sticking up, showing others snapped wind. It mercy weathered well did." Tom took glass. "I sorry them," he answered, "and I hope poor fellows living shore, would run great risk crushed. It makes think old song-- "`A strong nor'-wester's blowing, Bill; Hark I do not ye hear roar now? Lord help  them, I pities Unhappy folks shore now!' "I hope commander let us take run shore, however, sail." In course couple days repairs nearly finished, good deal painting done, commander resolved remain anchor another day. Green second lieutenant employed time surveying island, surveys complete. "I say, Gerald, must get trip way other," said Tom Desmond. "You would better run ashore, I am sure, suggested idea doctor, he say so, get Mr Mildmay let us boat." Gerald followed Tom's advice. "Of course, boy," answered good-natured doctor; "if find anything curious, remember bring me." "That I will, sir," said Tom. The doctor spoken first lieutenant, Tom went boldly asked use jolly-boat. "You her; remember must board good time," answered Mr Mildmay. Tom his party quickly ready, carrying fishing-lines, well baskets bring wild fruit might happen find. Tom Gerald making preparations, Billy Blueblazes came gun-room. "Holloa!" he exclaimed; "I have got leave go you. I suppose you will take grub?" "We will afther finding shore," answered Desmond; "game, fish, fruit. I propose carry couple muskets; shall sure find something other." "Elephants rhinoceroses," suggested Billy. "Not quite big beasts are," answered Tom. "We find rather cumbrous stow away game-bags." "But we will take bread, rum, cold beef--they likely grow island, events; potatoes either, pot boil in," remarked Desmond. The articles fancied would required quickly collected. "Shure, have not forgotten powder shot!" exclaimed Desmond, committing things charge Tim Nolan, accompany them, he might stow away boat. Pat Casey, Irishman saved savages, Jerry Bird, formed crew boat. Bird Nolan tried, steady men. Casey, accustomed savage life, might useful searching fruits animals might found island. He also first-rate fisherman, plenty experience his residence Indians. The party shoved soon second lieutenant master left ship. "The thing I am sorry Archie us," said Tom. "However, sure plenty fun sort other." At end bay small piece sandy beach, towards Tom steered boat. As surf, ran her it, stepped without difficulty. A nearer acquaintance, however, showed country tempting character first supposed. There trees close beach, broken two storm, lay prostrate ground. Even larger trees, species mahogany, lay uprooted directions, found difficult make way among them. Still, dint climbing fallen trunks, cutting road brushwood, made progress, discovered circle rocky hills, many places almost precipitous. It seemed almost hopeless attempt climbing them, especially Desmond acknowledged he "did feel well sort work," would likewise carry muskets, provisions cooking utensils. "As much time lose, I propose go back boat, try find another landing-place along coast," said Tom. His plan agreed to; launching boat, took oars. After rounding rocky point, formed eastern side bay, pulled along distance hopes finding another landing-place, whence could make way interior. As surf, sea perfectly smooth, kept close land. In many places high cliffs rose precipitously water. As pulled along foot one cliffs, Tom shouted out-- "Holloa! there is big cavern directly ahead us; water seems run right it, I surprised could get distance boat." They stopped rowing, survey mouth cavern. It appeared upwards thirty feet height almost width. Everybody, course, eager explore cavern; rowing gently, risk might run knocking bows boat rock, made way cavern. By keeping oars moving, boat glided on. Ahead, darkness, impossible ascertain far cave penetrated land. As soon eyes got accustomed subdued light existed distance thirty forty feet entrance, beauties grotto began dawn sight. Glittering stalactites, thousand fantastic forms, hung high vaulted roof, either side appeared columns arches like ancient temple, tinted numberless delicate hues, extreme points stalactites glittering like bright gems reached reflected rays sun, penetrated far depths beneath, illuminating every object glassy surface. So beautifully clear water, party boat looked sides, could see right bottom cavern, appeared consist masses rock, forming caves hollows, covered richest marine vegetation. Here corals various tints, blue yellow, red white: amid ocean fan expanded vast leaves; lowest depths sprang sea-green stems fucus, twining round columns sank far down, afforded support. Here feathery tufts green vegetables floated upwards clear water, others various strange shapes hues formed recesses arches, twisted knotted variety ways. Fish, varied forms brilliant colours, darted among openings, rising close boat, curious ascertain character visitors submarine palace. "I wish doctor tell us names," exclaimed Tom. "Look there, odd creatures. What be?" The fish he pointed flat, oval form, rich silvery colour, delicately striped downwards azure bands. They swam perpendicular position, aided two long slender fins, one curving upwards back, considerable length, curving downwards opposite side. There many others differing form, beautiful colours, darting gliding out, but, apparently less curious timid disposition excited Tom's astonishment, venture near boat. There cray-fish, too, large size, enormous crabs, star-fish, sea-urchins, bivalves various sorts clinging rocks, open mouths, catch unwary creatures coming within reach. After enjoying scene time, giving strokes oars midshipmen allowed boat proceed cavern. Most party hanging water noses surface, hands trying catch fish might venture near, cry Tim made spring up. "Shure, he will afther catching us, do not look out," exclaimed Irishman, moment saw rising far depths cavern enormous shark, his eyes glaring like two glowing coals, open jaws he came nearer nearer boat. "He will swallowing whole us," cried Tim. "Back water! back water!" To Irishman shark probably appeared much larger really was. "He will not us harm; keep oars water," said Tom, was, course, obeyed, shark glided alongside boat, he kept eyeing suspicious glances. "Would afther wishing one us?" asked Desmond. "Then I hope you will mistaken; unless, Billy, wish kind baste, let arm treat." "Thank you," said Billy; "I would rather not. It would not give much trouble bite off, though." "We must disappointed expectation exploring cavern brute like that," exclaimed Tom. "Hand boat-hook." Standing up, he struck point his might nose monster, instant sank suddenness made Tom lose his balance, Desmond Billy seized he would overboard. "He is afraid us him," said Tom. "Now let us get far cavern can." They pulled cautiously on, Tim standing bows, feeling ahead boat-hook. The mouth cavern seemed grow smaller smaller, point light remained. Suddenly Pat Casey, pulling Jerry Bird, declared he felt something seize blade his oar. "It is shark, perhaps," said Tom. "We muskets ready. I will give shot, make keep his distance. Wait he tries again." Tom took musket, stood ready fire. "There! he is got oar his jaws," cried Pat. Tom fired. The flash revealed instant sides roof cavern, seemed glitter studded thousands jewels, ahead pitchy darkness, showing yet got extremity. The sound report, greatly increased loudness, went echoing amid arches pillars, died away far distance, proving great extent cavern. Whether shark hit not, impossible say; bullet tore point Pat's oar, showing Tom taken good aim. Jerry Bird suggested midshipmen would prudent pull back, without torches could see going. There might be, could tell contrary, big sea monster squatting end, might crunch without ceremony. Though Tom apprehensions score, he agreed return, proposing, _Dragon_ remain anchor another day, explore cave supply torches. The boat accordingly cautiously pulled round, made her way towards mouth. It curious watch arch growing higher higher, light gradually increasing. They almost reached entrance, when, either side, one, several sharks, came gliding up. One, bolder bigger rest, seized blade oar, crunching end; men keep watchful eye save destroyed. Tom fired musket, declared bullet went shark's head. As monster appear worse it, Desmond Billy doubted fact. Not Tom fired several times, boat got considerable distance cavern, sharks leave her. "There is one thing certain: that is place bathe in, would pleasant tumble overboard hereabouts," observed Tom, gravely. "I never see black monsters, wicked eyes, floating near looking one, without feeling uncomfortable." They row farther expected. At last saw narrow opening reef rocks, within made small bay, sandy shore, could land ease draw boat. The country beyond, too, looked far tempting yet seen. The water passage deep, difficulty making way bay. As yet seen nothing second lieutenant's master's boats, which, supposing island small size, expected meet coming round opposite side. "We shall probably see cut directly across island," observed Tom. They disappointed bay. The beach exactly wished for. They hauled boat up, agreed she could left without danger. "But I hope fellows going begin long march without food," observed Billy, noted his excellent appetite. "We game, caught fish. It is lucky brought food, I advised." Wood collected, fire quickly made. As brought cold meat bread them, potatoes cook. This operation superintended Tim, rest party searched productions island might add repast. They gone far Tom exclaimed-- "Why, cocoa-nut trees, fine ones, too. I thought none island." "They cocoa-nut trees, sure enough," said Desmond, "and cocoa-nuts growing them. How get question, stems stout allow us swarm up." "`Where there is there is way'; must climb, way other," said Tom, never liked beaten. On reaching spot, found cocoa-nut trees, yams bananas, covering ground wildest profusion, latter climbing surrounding branches, ripe fruit hung temptingly down. On examining further, discovered remains fence, showing ground enclosed, purpose forming garden, probably distant period. "Bless man whoever planted these," said Jerry Bird; "he thought poor fellows might wrecked day other. If others would desert islands visit, lives many castaway seamen might saved." The yams, growing wild, likely worth much, bananas, notwithstanding latitude, appeared fine. In vain, however, gazed cocoa-nuts. Jerry, though active man, vowed he could attempt reach top unless could get rope one branches. While discussing matter, Pat Casey, helping Tim, came up, also caught sight cocoa-nut trees distance. "Bedad, I will afther it," he exclaimed; running back boat, he returned three four fathoms rope. This he twisted huge grummet round tree, leaving space enough his body get also. Then slipping behind his waist, he began swarm up, shoving rope opposite side tree time he moved on, high his shoulders. In wonderfully short time he reached top tree. "Stand under," he shouted out, he threw cocoa-nut, nearly hit Billy, attended his warning. Several cocoa-nuts split fall, Billy, rushing forward, seized one milk run out. This example followed rest: Seeing this, Pat secured several his neck, getting his grummet he descended. That one tree gave many nuts could require. "We ought take want," said Tom; "though shove off, get supply ship." Tim shouted "taters" cooked, returning camp-fire, party enjoyed satisfactory repast aid bananas cocoa-nuts. After made way distance inland, passing large forests tamanas, mahogany trees, appeared cover greater part island. Excepting deserted plantation, could discover fruit-bearing trees roots, observed traces wild animals, Pat asserted must hogs. As risk losing themselves, nothing induce continue ramble, returned boat. Desmond, seconded Billy, proposed set work fish, might carry supply board. Tom agreed, Pat collected quantity crabs he found among rocks, serve bait, embarked. They pulled towards mouth bay, inside high reef, completely shut sea view. Here, clear water, although fully three fathoms deep, bottom could clearly seen, covered masses coloured coral sea-weeds various shades tints. Amid observed beautiful fish sizes tints, gliding directions, disappearing cavern, darting sight. "As creatures see us lines, shall chance catching any," said Tom. "Just try, honour," exclaimed Pat; "they are mighty hungry bastes, accustomed look white faces, know we are afther." The hooks accordingly baited crabs, scarcely first line let big fish caught it, immediately hauled up. "I told so," cried Pat exultingly; "we shall many like catch." All eager get lines overboard, sooner hooks sunk towards bottom fish, attracted tempting bait, dashed forward seized them. "We will mighty soon boat load," exclaimed Pat, fish fish hauled in. Suddenly change came scene. From cavern, far reef, huge form appeared, similar monster attacked boat stalactite cave. Rapidly noiselessly glided up, Billy, felt bite, saw approach, seized fish bitten his hook. Billy gave pull, expecting haul his fish, nearly got his fingers cut his line, shark, finding something tickling his throat, darted it. Bird, seeing happened, cut line, away dashed shark. The monster put fish flight, time returned. Scarcely assembled, caught, than, sharks appearing, lines immediately drawn up, save fate Billy's met with. As pirates deep appeared, smaller fish darted directions. "Shure, matters little whether caught one us black brutes, excepting honour thing, pleasure tasting crab's leg die," observed Desmond. These interruptions prevented party taking note time. They got small number fish, still eager catch boat load; Tom, ought looked his watch, forgot so. Thus hour hour passed by, began get hungry, Desmond proposed going shore cooking fish. The idea good one meet dissenting voices; returning beach, quickly made fire, embers remained burning, soon three four fine fish roasting sticks round it, superintendence Pat Casey. So busy interesting occupation, one observed changed appearance sky. The fish were, Pat declared, "just done turn," Tom Desmond Billy served, latter filled his mouth dainty morsel, startled booming sound gun. Another followed. It evidently fired recall. "We ought got back this," exclaimed Tom, starting looking seawards. The rest followed him, carrying cooked fish beach. What dismay find, reaching it, boat, hauled up, floated rapidly rising tide, strong gust wind driven her considerable distance shore, she drifting off. Not moment lost. Tom felt he guilty act indiscretion remaining long shore, seen boat properly secured. He forgotten huge monsters sharks, prowling about, one way boat could regained. Somebody must swim her. These thoughts rapidly passed his mind. The swim nothing; he often swum ten times without fatigue. But sharks! He recollected shudder passed he seen approach boat two hours before. Without saying anything, he quickly thrown his clothes. "Shout, you, loud can," he exclaimed. "Good-bye, Desmond; good-bye, Billy," he said, shaking hands. "If I swallowed one brutes, say happened I duty." Without another word, Tom plunged in, rest party, rushing forward knees, began splashing water about, shouting top voices. "I cannot let go alone," said Jerry Bird, soon he saw midshipman about. Throwing his jacket shirt, he followed Tom, shouting lustily. "I coming, Mr Rogers," he cried; "you climb one side boat, I other." Tom within couple fathoms boat, his horror he saw dark fin, rising water. It stationary, however. Perhaps savage brute merely surveying boat, wondering strange creature was. Tom, undaunted sight, swam on. He might manage scramble board shark caught sight him. "Do lose heart, Bird," he cried out, he guessed his companion would seen shark's fin; "the chances he will not attack two us." A strokes more, Tom got hold gunwale boat; Jerry seized side. Tom, way fatigued, easily held up, and, got his left leg over, drag other, Jerry threw tilted boat side he on. It fortunate movement, shark ran his snout side, missing Tom's foot almost hair's breadth. Tom felt brute's head strike boat, well knew happened. It made draw his breath quickly; he work him. Without stopping moment, he Jerry, seizing oars, rapidly pulled boat back beach. Their companions gave way hearty cheer reached it. "Thank Heaven, escaped," said Desmond. "I saw happened; heart sank low I thought would never get right place. However, `a miss good mile'; sooner away better." Tom's Jerry's clothes handed boat, dressed themselves, rest party pulled bay. "I vote eat fish it is warm," said Billy Blueblazes, whose appetite (as Gerald used say him) "no dangers could daunt." "Just hand slice, I will eat I pull." This proposal seconded looks men, Tom accordingly passed portions, biscuit, forward. The crew ate fish gusto. They wise doing, might long pull them. Another another gun heard. "Those guns fired harbour," observed Tom; "the ship must put sea." Gerald agreed him; yet reef, ran across mouth bay, concealed her sight. The wind lately blowing quarters--now harbour, directly across it--until length heavy squall came entrance. "We shall strong wind teeth, pretty heavy pull," observed Tom Gerald. "I wish spent much time here; I shall justly get blame, anything happens." "It will not much matter gets blame happen drowned," answered Gerald. "However, known gone direction, captain probably stand along shore pick us up; chances shall safe board within hour so." The men bend backs oars force boat heavy seas came rolling narrow entrance. Under circumstances, Tom would put back waited improvement weather; signal recall peremptory, he considered his duty try get board risks. The sea, calm pulled along coast, tossed heavy foam-crested billows, came rolling rapid succession, bursting loud roars rock-bound shore, casting sheets spray reef. "We must heave cargo overboard," said Tom, he saw heavy seas come tumbling in. "The lighter boat better." The fish, hoped regale shipmates, quickly thrown overboard. "Shure, fine feast giving sharks," observed Desmond, he engaged work. They retained, however, dozen cocoa-nuts, case might required food. So slow progress made sea wind, almost dusk got clear land. Tom keeping look-out westward, side he expected ship appear. "There she is," he exclaimed length; "but she sail, standing south-east, I see smoke coming her funnel." Gerald agreed Tom case. They asked Jerry Bird, oldest seaman board, give his opinion. "You are right, sir," he said; "to mind something happened machinery. Either shaft piston rod broken, cannot get screw work. The commander, course, like remain bay, chance hurricane blowing right it; he got steam, probably standing along shore look us, accident, whatever was, happened; chance he saving ship go stand course he doing. Maybe he come long look us." Tom Gerald sure commander would desert them, time felt far comfortable seeing ship great distance off. The wind rapidly increasing; seas came rolling far heavily before, spray foaming crests sent boat, soon thoroughly wetted hands. This, course, one cared much about; question whether small boat would live furious sea likely encounter got board. If Jerry Bird right, ship herself must endeavour get good offing island case hurricane come on. Of seemed every probability. The gloom night rapidly increased, could distinguish ship light she showed her quarter. Was intended signal them, two boats yet returned her? As night advanced, weather became worse worse. "It is old rascal Harry Cane his tricks again," cried Tim; "I wish he waited bit, let us get comfortably board." "Never complain, Tim," observed Pat; "maybe shall glad have not left boat; got harbour lee, plenty grub shore, that is many poor fellow wished for, able find." Tom Gerald excessively anxious get board, determined persevere long possibly could. The men strained oars hearty good will. Now boat mounted one sea, rapidly descend trough another. Tom steered her carefully, keeping her head seas. He full well knew moment one heavy tops seas falling board might swamp her. Bird frequently looked his shoulder anxious glance. "Beg pardon, Mr Rogers, will not do," he said length; "the keener put run back harbour, better chance shall living night; happened ship I cannot tell. But, it is blowing like this, dead shore, shall not get board to-night to-morrow either." Tom Gerald length saw Jerry Bird right. They could longer distinguish _Dragon's_ lights. Either thick mist arisen, she got far seen; indeed, shore itself, boat sank hollow sea, invisible. "We must look smooth, pull boat round, lads," cried Tom. "Arrah! shure, hard matter find," said Tim Nolan, himself. Watching opportunity, Tom, trough sea, got boat round. "Give way, lads! give way!" he shouted out. Not necessity saying that; men knew well enough lives depended pulling hard could. Any moment sea, rolling astern, might break them. Tom stood look entrance harbour, he believed must approaching, he could see nothing one unbroken line foam bursting reef. The land rose shores bay. On highest part Tom recollected observed large clump tamana trees, which, pulled harbour, he noted good land-mark entering. In daylight could easily seen, darkness he could scarcely hope make sky, boat tumbled rolled way she doing. Still, hope; she strike reef either side entrance, she must instant dashed pieces, hands washed amidst foaming breakers. "Now, Desmond, use eyes never before, try see clump trees, find passage." Gerald strained his eyes. "I think I see dark spot almost ahead," he said length. "If do, must entrance," observed Tom. "I see other; chance; boat live long sea getting up." Tom steered towards point Gerald indicated. On sped boat. The loud roar breakers neared shore almost deafened them, Gerald, though sitting next Tom, shout make hear. "That is passage, I am sure it," he cried out. "You are right," answered Tom. "Give way, lads!" The boat rushed on. A tremendous sea, huge crest foam, came roaring astern, threatened overwhelm her. The men saw it, redoubled efforts. On either side rose wall white foam dashing directly rocks beneath fishing. An instant later boat would swamped; she flew, surrounded spray, another minute floating comparatively smooth water within sheltering reef. At moment hurricane burst forth, sending breakers flying sheets reef, howling fearfully went rushing amid trees forest, tearing huge limbs, laying many low, vivid flashes lightning followed peals rattling thunder, adding yet wild uproar elements. "Thank Heaven, safe!" exclaimed Gerald. "We may rightly acknowledge that; become boats old barkey?" said Tom. CHAPTER TWO. LAND--BURY THE BOAT--TAKE SHELTER UNDER A ROCK--THE HURRICANE RAGES--THE NIGHT PASSES BY--DESMOND SHOOTS AT A WILD BEAST--STORM ABATES--NO SHIP-- BOAT MISSING--BOAT DISCOVERED--TIM'S PORK CHOPS--DIGGING OUT THE BOAT-- PAT CHARGED BY A WILD BOAR--FLAG-STAFF SET UP--NO SHIP APPEARS--A HUT BUILT--EXPLORE THE ISLAND--MISS THE HOGS, BUT KILL SOME BIRDS-- PREPARATIONS FOR THE VOYAGE--TURTLE--BILLY'S EXPLOIT--LEAKY CONDITION OF THE BOAT--SEARCH FOR PITCH--TOM AND DESMOND SET OUT TO EXPLORE THE ISLAND. Tom steered boat bay towards beach lately left. It longer afforded easy landing place, waves came rolling in, even narrow entrance, creating surf sandy shore, scarcely her stern touched beach sea burst board, wetting every one through, nearly washing several articles her. All hands therefore jumped out. "Now, lads, long pull, strong pull, pull together," cried Tim. In another minute boat hauled beach, began taking things carrying spot left fire burning. Fortunately, muskets ammunition, though wet, saved, articles value boat, together compass Tom thoughtfully brought, although hitherto use it. The ashes fire still alight, found exposed beach spot would exactly wish encamp. "We must find sheltered place, put tent," said Tom Desmond. "A high overhanging rock would suit us best, will not tall mahogany trees, may moment crash upon heads, already specimen likely behave." "I would rather get snug cavern, discover one," said Desmond. "But found dark?" "I will soon twist couple torches I used make I Prime Minister Cannibal Islands," cried Pat Casey. "I think could find way left, I saw big rocks morning, I surprised find tolerable shelter them." "We ought soon possible," observed Tom, "for shall probably rain upon us many minutes over,--and hurricane begun, must remember. Get torches made soon can. Before leave must look boat, haul her farther beach; impossible say high water may rise hurricane setting shore." They accordingly hurried back ran boat feet farther up, beyond found impossible move her. "If leave her she is, she will sure blown away," observed Jerry Bird. "If I may advise, sir, I would make sort dock round her, fill her sand, sink her it. It cost us little trouble clear again, better her knocked pieces." Tom Desmond highly approved Jerry's proposal. All hands, therefore, set work boat stretchers make dock, easily quickly accomplished. They filled her sand, almost gunwale. "She steady enough now, sir," said Jerry. As soon work finished, returned former encampment, carrying boat's mast, yards, sails, oars them, assist forming tent, rest her gear placed safety high bank. Pat quickly twisted torches fibre cocoa-nuts, loading property, set out, he leading way. Scarcely commenced march, felt almost taken feet; loud crash heard, fell large tree, close were, torn roots. Happily weather side. They hurried on, keeping much possible open ground. Another blast came redoubled fury, almost blowing Pat's torches, burnt, indeed, much rapidity, seemed little probability able reach point towards steering, light. They gone far two torches burnt out. Heavily laden were, could move fast. Tim Nolan alone staggering boat's sail, oar, musket, basket provisions. Jerry Bird breaker water hung his back, equally heavily laden. It great relief Tom he heard Pat shout out, "Here rocks, though sign cave I see." "Perhaps, skirt along them, may find still sheltered place this," observed Tom. The party accordingly moved on, Pat announced his torch beginning burn his fingers, found recess rocks, well sheltered wind, although would obtain protection rain begin fall. The end torch afforded sufficient light collect sticks fire, light able put tent. The side rock affording back, made slope rock ground, heaviest rain would run off. There room hands get it, closely packed; fatigues day, thankful obtain shelter. As far, indeed, concerned, reason complain. They shelter, fire, food, water. "Let us see brought, Billy?" said Gerald. Billy produced three fish, he hung his back. "I thought want something supper, always wise carry one's grub one," he observed. "Much obliged forethought," said Gerald; Tim Pat summoned cook fish. The fire made close rock, much influenced wind. In short time Tim announced supper ready, "smoking hot," bottle rum produced provision basket. "Now, lads," said Tom, he poured liquor. "I want stint grog, recollect small supply, belief may many days get back ship, glass apiece I give you." The grog mixed, seamen, young officers, sat round fire, thinking little past future. The fish pronounced excellent; sipped grog one alternately spun yarn sang song. Tom Rogers must excepted. He felt his responsibility commanding party, he could get consciousness he ought returned earlier hour ship. This thought weighed his spirits, although he tried allow his companions discover his uneasiness. He felt also anxious ship. If Jerry Bird right supposing accident happened machinery, she might, hurricane, exposed greatest possible danger; she wrecked, might remain many months island, could find opportunity escaping. Tom, he came sea, often read living desert island one two pleasant companions, thought would good fun. When reality rose vividly him, he could confess he would rather keeping watch board, prospect returning home see his father, mother, friends. When, however, came his turn sing, he trolled forth, his rich deep voice, "Cease, rude Boreas," sea song character, he anxious thoughts trouble him. The blazing fire kept served dry clothes. When, hour later, rain came down, will not tropics, crept tent, taking care carry muskets things would damaged wet them. Tom, spite his fatigue, lay awake time. He thankful safe shore, able find sheltered position encampment. The wind roared howled terrific manner among forest trees. The earth seemed shake, would topple high rock them; although branches, sometimes large shrubs, torn roots, flew heads, none fell tent. Sometimes, several minutes together, crash succeeded crash, huge trees levelled ground. Then would come lull, wind would whistle mournfully, rather moan, recommence roaring lustily ever. Tom wondered his companions could sleep soundly amid uproar. The light fire, came side tent, fell forms stretched heads rock; while, lulls tempest, he could hear snoring away concert. He sufficiently well acquainted natural history Pacific Islands aware wild beasts interfere them, excepting hogs, whose traces seen; he every reason believe island uninhabited. He thought possible, however, rocks top cliff, loosened hurricane, might come tumbling heads; earth small branches hitherto fallen, he hoped would continue places. At events, even he his companions move away, likely find secure shelter. Should refuge sought trees, might prove still treacherous. He kept eye fire, fearing sudden blast might whisk embers tent; but, canvas thoroughly wet, would take time burn. He got two three times, and, standing his back cliff, he avoided rain poured torrents scarcely foot front him. Excepting glare fire cast upon white tent one side, black rocks other, shrubs front, pitchy darkness, though, looking upwards, he could distinguish tops trees waving fro sky. "I pray dear old _Dragon_ may escaped this!" he ejaculated once, hurricane, apparently renewed strength, hurled island. At length Desmond roused up. "You must two hours' watch more. Tom," he said. "Just lie get snooze; may long pull us, will not much room sleeping boat." Tom, sorry relieved, lay down, Desmond took his place. How long Tom sleeping he could tell, he rest party aroused shot fired close oars, and, looking up, saw Desmond musket his shoulder, he discharged. "What fire at?" asked Tom. "At bear, wolf, big baste other, shure," answered Desmond. "Whatever shall find out, cannot far off. I hit it, I certain that, gave terrible growl, bolted back bushes." The fire time almost burnt out, giving forth faint glow, scarcely afforded light sufficient see objects except close them, would useless attempt searching wild beast Desmond asserted he shot. He acknowledged he dropped asleep, that, suddenly awakening, he seen animal's eyes glaring ten yards off. Tom, looking his watch declining light fire, saw nearly dawn. A change better occurred. The strength hurricane much abated, though tree tops still waved backwards forwards wind whistled howled amid branches, abated breath, rain completely ceased. On looking up, small spaces clouds could seen, which, there, star glittered brightly. Jerry Bird, ought watch before, took Desmond's place, party settled wait morning. Sailors accustomed short snatches sleep. Even half hour less rest despised, less minute eyes closed happy forgetfulness were. Tom required calling; he scarcely forgotten his sleep happened, sooner pale light early morn driven away darkness night, than, opening his eyes, he crept tent Bird, dropped off. "I let rest sleep on, see things look," he said himself. As he made his way fallen trunks towards bay, he kept looking discover accessible part hill, he might climb summit rock, whose shelter slept, he supposed highest point thereabouts, order he might obtain wide view ocean around. He length found part, whence little climbing he might reach top hill. He began his ascent, he heard Desmond's voice shouting him, sitting he waited his messmate come up. The rock rugged uneven first supposed. Sometimes Desmond helped ledge, he hauled Desmond him. Here shrubs grew crevices rock, assisted ascent. At last stood together top. On casting eyes around, could nowhere see ship; indeed, scarcely expected she would sight. As far eye could range southward eastward, foam-crested giant waves leaped down, already motion becoming less rapid, seemed tumbling lazily slowly other, weary late exertions, though breakers incessantly burst rocky coast, sending masses foam flying far inland. "Even ship appear, likely able get her to-day," observed Desmond, pointing entrance bay, seas came tossing foaming. "It seems wonder got last night." "We may indeed thankful heaven swamped," said Tom; "but I surprised find, within hours, ship appear, get her. There scarcely time sea go since hurricane ceased blowing; I hope boats got board, run great risk lost." "Perhaps shipmates landed," observed Desmond; "and shall meet long. I glad know certain Archie Jos Green Mr Joy safe, though terrible thing think ship may cast away." "We hope best," answered Tom; "and go see boat fared. I somewhat anxious her, though I do not see could secured her better did." The descent nearly difficult climb hill, ran great risk, leaping rock rock, slipping tumbling dozen feet time next level. They nearly reached bottom, saw Billy Blueblazes Jerry Bird looking towards them. The countenances wore aspect dismay. "What happened?" asked Tom. "The boat gone!" answered Billy; "we cannot see her anywhere, even bit her wreck." "Faith! that is bad news," exclaimed Desmond; "but look everywhere? for, remember, everywhere means good wide space." "No, go right spot, use that," answered Billy. "Then will, perhaps may discover signs may indicate direction she driven," said Tom. They accordingly set off. Tom observed Billy failed do, shape beach greatly altered, wind driven sand far higher usual, parts risen height bank grass shrubs grew. Indeed, portion grassy ground covered sand. "What shall without boat?" cried Billy; "we shall spend lives here, I suppose, ship lost, men say think she little chance escaping." "I hope wrong conjectures," answered Tom; "and boat, I quite certain she lost, although may trouble finding her." On arriving part beach boat left, Tom looked round every direction, examined carefully bushes herbage along edge beach. "If she driven direction, she would broken bushes, appear injured," he observed. "Now, let us see whereabouts she lay. Do think tell, Bird?" The seaman examined ground. "I remember coming clump bushes these, directly I left her; look there, sir, her rudder stretcher," he enumerated articles belonging boat. Then stepping back, he said, "I am sure hereabouts she lay." "Then, depend upon it, shall find her. Do not see sand blown her, she safe enough within it. To save trouble, dig line parallel beach, another right angles, chances shall strike part her gunwale long." "Shall I go call men?" asked Billy. "They cooking breakfast, sir," observed Bird. "Let go means," said Tom; "if find boat come back afterwards dig her up." They immediately set work, Tom's directions, sand risen even higher supposed, boat's stretchers hands work with, slow business. "I have thought, sir, quicker way finding her this," observed Jerry; taking his axe, he cut short pole sharp point, ran though sand, along line Tom marked out. "There is something here, sir," he cried length, forthwith hole dug spot. Jerry plunged his hand. "No doubt it, sir; there is boat's side, weight sand bulged her out, she rights." "I fear score," observed Tom. "The sand probably driven around her, afforded her sides support. I thankful took precaution banking her did, I pretty sure she would rolled over, knocked pieces." The party satisfied safety boat, returned camp, found Tim Pat busily engaged huge fire cooking pork chops. "Why, come from?" asked Tom. "Shure, sir, porker found bush. It is belief it is baste Mr Desmond shot last night. He quite dead, showed fight, finished him, cut jiffy." "I congratulate success," said Tom. "To tell truth," said Desmond, "I half dreaming time; I quite sure morning whether I shot anything not, I am mighty glad find dream come true." The pork chops found satisfactory, still know abundance animal food island; one hog, would certainty many more; time, would prevented increase roots would otherwise afforded nourishment. "As hogs live here, there, probably acorns nuts various sorts, even cocoa-nuts bananas run short, need apprehension wanting vegetable diet," said Tom Desmond. "Again I say good reason thankful landed island abounding provisions." "I wish brought tea, coffee, sugar," said Billy. "I enjoyed breakfast much more." "Be thankful got," observed Tom. Before setting commence digging boat, Tom suggested form rough spades, without operation would tedious one. They fortunately brought two axes cutting fire-wood, Jerry Pat managed chop fallen branches six rough spades. They would finished better style Tom allowed them. Having ascertained exact position boat, running pointed stick, commenced operations. They much surprised enormous pit dig even reached gunwale boat. The digging easy enough; labour consisted heaving sand sufficient distance. All hands getting hungry. Billy, usual, first cry out. "What say dinner, Rogers?" Tom looked his watch, directed Pat go camp prepare dinner, rest continued work before. It took till noon clear away sand far gunwale, course necessary dig much wider space round boat simply her width. The sun, too, become excessively hot, coverings heads straw hats. Tom suggested stick large leaves small branches bands, means effectual shelter could formed heads. In spite heat, returned good appetites camp. "Bedad, it is fortunate got anything eat all," exclaimed Pat, approached. "Just I came up, I see couple porkers poking noses tent; another minute would got hold meat fish I hung ready cooking. I would turned pork pretty quickly, I could get hold musket, scampered away back woods; we will even long. When I went look rest hog, bastes had not eaten brother, barring hide, quarrelling over, way torn pieces." There ample supply pork, fish, bananas, cocoa-nuts vegetables, day's dinner Tom consider provision made supper, next day. Eager he get boat dug out, case ship appear, he would allow his companions work couple hours more, fear suffering stroke sun, whose fierce rays beat terrific force sand. Pat, well inured far greater heat, line itself, meantime took one muskets, "to try kill game," he said, "or one porkers lately paid visit." The rest party lay shade rock, prepare afternoon's work. Pat absent time, couple shots heard; lately sound reached them, heard report great distance. Presently he seen scampering along, big boar close his heels. It appeared next instant creature's tusks would run him, he seized branch free threw upon it, animal ripped hem his broad trousers. Luckily canvas gave way, Pat would brought ground. The boar looked his late opponent he still meditated vengeance; suddenly seeing party cliff, he came towards them, tearing ground his fury, his sharp tusks. Fortunately musket loaded. "Stand by, advance flight," cried Tom, seizing weapon. Bird grasped boat-hook, Desmond Tim took axe, Billy, arms, fulfilled latter part order, beginning climb ledge rock one side cliff. It moment dreadful suspense, for, Tom miss, he well knew boar's tusks might, next instant, pierce through. Fortunately animal caught sight Billy he climbing cliff. This moment distracted his attention, and, instead coming directly Tom his companions, swerved little one side. Seeing, however, Billy got beyond reach, came galloping towards them, singling Jerry, conspicuous object, attack. Tom waited got within twelve feet, he fired. The bullet hit animal, stop it. Jerry sprang one side avoid charge, drove his boat-hook neck, bearing ground. On Tim Desmond sprang forward, and, could rise, dealt several heavy strokes axes, preventing committing mischief. "Hurrah; you have finished baste, I hope," cried Pat, watching proceedings his bough, came hurrying forward. "I would somehow missed couple pigs, I caught sight big fellow taking snooze sun. I creeping him, he opened his wicked eyes, I had not taken heels he would his tusks me. At last I stopped behind free gave shot; he did not mind all, all, reason bullet flew his head, I run it. However, `All's well ends well,' and, sure, supper, greatest pleasure world." After specimen rat's sportsmanlike qualities, Tom resolved trust musket again, necessary carefully husband powder shot. As, however, Pat possessed good qualifications butcher, he left cut boar, rest party returned boat, he directed rejoin soon he secured joints. Digging boat severe labour, prevent sand slipping back thrown several feet either side boat. They cut channel water. Tom soon saw could hope get boat afloat another whole day soonest. Diligently worked, sun sinking rapidly towards horizon boat free sand. They examined her anxiously, fearing her sides might forced out; but, far could ascertain, she received material injury. "We must take another look-out ship, gets dark," exclaimed Tom; he Desmond set ascend hill, whence could obtain extensive view ocean around them. In vain strained eyes; sail sight--not speck appeared horizon. The sea rolling lazy undulations, flecked foam, sparkled brightly rays setting sun, sea-fowl venturing forth rocky homes search prey. "She must run long distance gale, take her time beat back," observed Tom. "We must give her yet." "I think not, indeed," answered Desmond. "It would rather inconvenient she come, got boat afloat. However, must manage get signal-staff set to-morrow morning, case she appear, may know are, send help us." Tom agreed Desmond, accordingly arranged cut flag-staff first thing next day, manufacture flag might seen ship. Descending rock, returned companions, still hard work. Pat, however, sent back, light fire prepare supper. The party continued digging sand darkness length compelled give over. They little difficulty making way back camp, eyes gladdened sight Pat's blazing fire. "We must compliment pork chops," exclaimed Billy, holding remains one he discussing help his clasp knife. "I will trouble another, soon it is done brown." "You are welcome it, sir; and, bedad, I am mighty better pleased cooking his hams, his tusks mine," answered Pat. The supper pronounced excellent, though nothing cold water neighbouring rivulet wash down. Tim suggested thimbleful rum would mighty pleasant. Tom refused serve limited supply, determined keep case emergency. Although he express his fears his companions, he could help dreading accident might happened _Dragon_. The night passed quickly away. As soon daylight Tom Desmond ascended look-out place. They doomed disappointment. The sea become perfectly calm, light air occasionally rippling surface. "It take her good many hours get island, even she sight," observed Tom. "Still must get flag-staff set up, case she appear launch boat, shall fortunate night." As soon breakfast over, Tom told men wanted, hands went search tree fit purpose. None, however, discovered. At last agreed young cocoa-nut tree must cut down. This soon done Jerry Tim, rest recommenced attempt free boat. All hands required get flag-staff top rock set up. The three men offered handkerchiefs, others belonging midshipmen formed tolerably sized flag. As halyards, fixed rope yarns top staff, set up. A crevice found rock, driven, fixed either side large stones. "That show clearly enough are, count number handkerchiefs, know right," observed Desmond. "I trust ship come," said Tom, though he could throw much confidence his tone. "Now, lads, must go back dig away boat. I like see her afloat to-night early to-morrow morning." In spite heat, toiled on, even returning camp dinner; Pat instead sent bring provisions water. Notwithstanding perseverance, work finished Tom set alone another look Flag-staff Hill. He soon seen coming back. "Not sign her," he said; taking his spade he resumed his labours. A heap sand still remained boat water, removed she could launched. "We must get rollers her, drag her water," observed Jerry, he stamped his foot soft yielding sand her keel. "You right," said Tom, "and must make first thing morning." The songs sung yarns spun evening cheerful been; indeed, hands sleepy glad turn soon supper over. Tom hoped hope, next morning ship would appear, accident happened her. Even without her machinery she would surely able beat island time. Tom flag-staff soon light enabled see his way hill. He waited, gazing anxiously horizon, ruddy glow suffused sky, announced rising sun. But sail appeared. "She come all," he exclaimed himself; "she must driven rocks fearful night, probably hands perished. Poor Archie, I wish he come us, I very, sorry rest." Tom, however, well knew he must give way his melancholy forebodings, that, events, his duty try keep spirits his companions. On returning tent he put unconcerned countenance possible, sat breakfast he nothing his mind. The high flavour pork showed must, first place, look another hog, means must found preserving it. Pat asserted hams still good, Tom suggested immediately smoked, salt could scraped rocks, obtained evaporation. "You see got plenty do, even spend month here, shall time idle," he observed. Jerry Tim, recommenced digging, cut axes number rollers, placed boat's keel, renewed ardour hands set work clear away intervening sand. It took, however, much longer expected, another day drawing close could attempt begin launching her. She moved, however, feet cut hollow she imbedded, object gained night putting her water, although bay smooth she might floated perfect safety. Tom made his usual visit Flag-staff Hill, came back report previous evening. "Before launch boat," he said, he rejoined party breakfast, "we must dismantle tent; indeed wise wear sail using roof. We may want it, shall certainly require oars. I therefore propose, ship appear noon, build hut place tent, shall shelter, require it, night. We cannot tell may need. The hurricane season yet over, may depend upon that. We came first blow, may several others weather becomes settled." "What! Do think ship's coming back us?" asked Billy, anxious tone. "I like change clothes, I wish tea sugar, hard tack, pepper, mustard, sorts things." "As ship's coming back, it is possible she may not," observed Tom. "If she not, must manage without things like have, make best got." "That is right sort philosophy," observed Jerry Bird, knew he might take liberty another man might not, talk freely his officers. As soon breakfast over, oars gear boat carried beach, when, help rollers, she was, hands hauling together, labour, run water. As Tom feared might case, soon discovered that, either hot atmosphere pressure she subjected, she leaked considerably. The leaks, however, hoped, would partially fill up, though she would require fresh caulking, coat tar, substitute, tar procured. The hour noon approached, and, spite heat, Tom Desmond climbed flag-staff. They looked around horizon, other. "I afraid she come all," exclaimed Desmond. "I feared much first," answered Tom. "Then propose doing?" asked Desmond. "I do not wish live month month, tell year year, fellows fighting Chinese, rest world, perhaps." "No, I," said Tom. "We must fit boat well sea, try make way, either back Japan, Ladrones, bound; but, I said before, will not put sea hurricane season over. Even fine weather pretty long trip open boat; people gone far, much farther, others done do." "I ready anything think best," answered Desmond, "and I sure rest be, must try fit boat long voyage, sooner set better." "It difficult job without tools," observed Tom. "Faith, I forgot that," remarked Desmond. "Still, often say, `Where there is there is way.' As shall want sail, must try manufacture thick matting instead canvas, fix bows raise gunwale foot two, keep sea. Then provisions, shall salt many hogs kill, dry stock yams, carry water cocoa-nut shells." "I glad, Gerald, thought matter; that is I going propose," said Tom. "Of course," cried Gerald. "I thinking number things besides I digging sand, though I like talk time came action." Thus two midshipmen discussed plans future. On return camp, time fixed upon Tom passed ship arrived, tent dismantled Tom set men work cut poles sufficient length serve rafters uprights. Their tent answered well agreed hut roof shape. The walls formed closely interlacing uprights creepers, also served bind large pandanus leaves used covering roof. The hut nearly completed, Tom Desmond set out, armed muskets, try kill hog small game. Billy wanted go, Tom advised remain assist finishing hut. "If one fellows run you, could without weapon sort?" "But I would take boat-hook," said Billy. "A wild bear would afther laughing hands," observed Desmond. Though saw several hogs, animals seemed abound island, unable get near enough obtain fair shot. While search hogs, object also explore island. They made way across northern side. It consisted deep indentations high rocks, top one climbed; could make far distance another island north them. Though narrowly scanned ocean every direction, sail seen. "I determined give her altogether," said Tom; "but still, she escaped shipwreck, I cannot account commander coming look us. My idea mistake he supposes lost, driven long way southward, he think worth come far his course." On way back caught sight large number good-sized birds perched thickly tree, apparently intending roost night. Having drawn bullets, loaded small shot, firing midst birds, brought dozen, proved species pigeon. "We got something supper, events," cried Desmond he ran pick birds finish still fluttering ground. Their ill-success hog-hunting made determine next day go fishing boat. It need said either Tom Desmond paid periodical visits flag-staff. So often disappointed last gave expectation seeing ship. Their fishing excursion, though successful first, produced good supply fish, ate fresh rest dried sun smoked wood fire. They had, however, keep baling nearly whole time. This satisfied must caulk boat could venture sea her. All hands busily employed variety ways. Pat woven baskets long grass, Billy Tim, carrying one, went search salt, found plentiful supply hollows rocks, close sea. Tom Desmond searched directions trees might yield pitch gum description would serve pay outside boat, searched vain. "We must find substitute pitch, cannot accomplish voyage, that is certain," said Tom. The boat constantly kept wet; last tried sinking her several hours together, her planks would swell sufficiently stop leaks. They almost despair. "Had good supply powder, might live luxury fish, flesh, fowl, plenty vegetables; without powder, get continuance weather, may reduced vegetable diet," said Desmond, sitting round fire supper. "As hogs, may pretty sure catching them," observed Pat; "we soon find runs, digging pitfalls will not long porker find his way in." "Then sooner manage dig pitfall catch porker better," said Tom. "That thing I will set to-morrow morning, Tim mate," answered Pat. Tim agreed, arranged. "I like get half dozen hogs well salted smoked, may fear meat turning bad," said Tom; "we cannot tell long voyage may last, us run short provisions help it. We must also catch cure supply fish, they, yams, serve us provisions. Nothing else likely keep, though perhaps may obtain birds vegetables islands may pass." "But will not land, sir, unless know people inhabit them," said Pat. "Where I living long would knocked visitors head eaten up, certainty." "My belief people side equator generally well disposed towards strangers," said Tom. "I heard commander say short time ago, he reading books subject." So altogether Tom persuaded imbued his companions idea proposed voyage could performed without extraordinary risk, hands looked forward time might venture commence it--not tired remaining island--but even men wish spend days there, midshipmen naturally anxious employed active service. Next morning, Tom, gone usual flag-staff take look out, he descending, saw several dark objects moving sand bay him. Some far dry sand, others nearer water. "Those must turtle," he said himself; "we may catch quick it, return water." He hurried back camp told his companions he seen. They followed fast could scamper towards bay. Each man got hold stick weapon sort. The instinct turtle telling enemies approaching, farthest beach began make way, vigorously working fins, towards water. Tom Desmond, ahead, managed get sticks good-sized one, turned without much difficulty, attacked three others succession, throwing backs. The rest party come up. Jerry Tim, way, turned two more. Their success encouraged Billy, who, ambitious, tackled big fellow, scrambling away great rate towards water. Billy, courageous lion, seized hold fins, instant he covered showers sand thrown fin, turtle showed disposition stop. Billy shouted his companions come help him. Pat, though last field, turned turtle, rushed forward seized big fellow fin; creature got good way stopped united efforts midshipman Irish sailor, another instant dragged water. It still shallow turtle swim, used four flappers much effect two assailants, give thorough shower-bath. "We must him; help, help!" shouted Billy; "do not let go, Pat!" "That I will not, shure!" answered Pat, maintained his hold like grim death hind flapper. "Tim, darlin', quick here, baste off. Jerry, man, lend hand." "Rogers, Desmond, come help, fellow get away trouble," shouted Billy. Thus summoned, whole party came assistance two heroes, Tim his eagerness toppling his nose shallow water. He quickly, however, recovered himself, he Jerry seizing one fore flappers, Tom Gerald other. They managed stop progress unfortunate turtle, though well wetted. With heave turned turtle dragged dry beach. By time nearly turtle escaped; another big fellow got water, paddling off, Pat his eagerness threw upon it, shouting his companions help. Billy dashed forward, Pat moment contrived turn turtle, but, unhappily poor Billy, his foot slipping, he fell turtle top him; though his head water, turtle almost smothered water sand, flappers sent flying his face. "Help, help!" he kept crying out. Pat, his efforts release midshipman, also slipped turtle, time working deep water, dragging assailants, still held on, it. Tom Gerald, however, came rescue; already turtle got water sufficient depth enable recover proper position, good effect use flappers, that, spite exertions midshipmen Pat, choose drawn deep water risk drowned seized lurking shark, losing prize, instinctively let go, turtle diving, joined fortunate companions escaped. As, however, turtle caught party could possibly eat, complain. "Hurrah! I do not mind wetting," cried Billy, he shook like spaniel coming water. "We shall live many day like aldermen." "There is little chance eating turn bad," observed Desmond. "You need fear that, sir," said Pat; "we build house them, live happy princes till want cook them?" His plan form enclosure roof protect turtle rays sun, keep well supplied wet sea-weed. "I wonder I think that," said Tom. "We propose immediately." The axes soon work, enclosure formed sufficient size contain turtle, returned breakfast, dragging one smaller turtle, destined serve food day. They turtle steaks for, breakfast, turtle soup dinner, turtle night. "It pity port wine, cayenne pepper, lemons," cried Billy. "We complain, since abundance salt," said Tom. "For part, I think every reason thankful ample supply food provided." As day day went hope _Dragon_ would return became fainter fainter. Tom made his mind escape island, must perform voyage boat; he examined her he could help confessing she ill-suited undertaking her present state. Whenever went fishing keep constantly baling, ran great risk going down. He anxiety provisions, though would difficulty preserving sufficiently stand constant exposure sun wet. That risk must, however, run. He charged Pat Tim thoroughly salt smoke pork fish. He directed also clear number cocoa-nuts serve bottles holding water. Pat succeeded catching two hogs his pit-fall, subject carrying water discussed, he offered sew skins, form two big leathern bottles. "Where find needles thread sew up?" asked Tom. "The needles! shure, I would afther makin' bone, would difficulty finding thread." Though Tom allowed preparations go on, his mind easy regard condition boat, Desmond agreed that, unless her leaks could stopped, would madness put sea. While men, therefore, continued working several tasks Tom assigned them, assisted Billy, fond long walks, he Desmond continued search pitch something would answer substitute. Desmond heard pitch springs, looked time, Tom recollected alone found volcanic regions, could expect discover vegetable substance. At last determined explore whole island, would occupy two tree days. Taking one muskets, filled wallets--which Pat lad manufactured plaited grass--with store dried yams, salt pork, fish, carried case unsuccessful obtaining game. They charged Billy, _Dragon_ appear, fire musket left behind, also light beacon fire summit Flag-staff Hill, smoke would probably able distinguish part island. Bidding farewell companions, first directed course towards south-east end island, which, rocky barren appearance, yet visited. CHAPTER THREE. TOM AND DESMOND DISCOVER A WRECK--HORRIBLE SCENE--FIND TOOLS AND STORES ON BOARD--RETURN WITH THEIR TREASURES TO THE CAMP--VISIT THE WRECK IN THEIR BOAT, AND BRING BACK STORES--THE BOAT FITTED FOR SEA--LAST NIGHT ON SHORE--SETTING SAIL--STEER FOR JAPAN--WIND CHANGES--STAND TO THE SOUTH--A LONG CALM--FOLLOWED BY A SHARK--A BREEZE, BUT AGAINST THEM-- RUNNING SHORT OF PROVISIONS--REDUCED TO YAMS AND OIL--BOAT RUN DOWN BY A WHALER--DESMOND AND TIM MISSING--TOM AND JERRY FIND THEM. Tom Gerald trudged manfully forward survey island. The path uneven. They kept near coast could, frequently could make way, account ruggedness rocks, turning inland. They clamber fallen trunks cut path axe thick creepers. At times climb wild rocks rugged hills, descend again, either valley running shore shore itself. Their object being, however, examine productions island, generally kept away beach. They made good eight ten miles, when, ascending rocky height, obtained view sea line coast distance. Suddenly Tom stopped put his hand his companion's arm. "Tell me, Desmond, think dark object there? It curiously shaped, like--or, it--" "A vessel, sure," exclaimed Desmond, whose eyes turned towards spot. "How could she come without seeing her?" "She may possibly time," said Tom. "Certainly she must wrecked gale landed here, she appears thrown high rocks." As got vessel, saw she driven shore two ledges, she remained fixed. It probably high tide she wrecked, water completely left her. After much difficulty, scrambling along rocks, midshipmen got alongside, hauled board ropes hanging bows. The vessel fore-top-sail schooner. Her masts still standing, her canvas hoisted, though torn tatters, fluttering breeze. A horrible odour came main hold went aft, looking horror see three bodies, one apparently white seaman, his dress, two evidently blacks, rags still hanging remains. The two midshipmen anxious accomplish survey vessel, hastened aft. About companion hatch bulwarks, wood chipped off, bullets, signs severe struggle taken place time board. They descended companion ladder; foot stains blood, traces discovered steps. They expected, odour pervaded whole vessel, find festering body cabin, human being, either dead alive, there. They discovered, however, evidently captain's log-book, shown vessel _Ark_, Brisbane, Queensland, she engaged carrying labourers various islands serve apprentices three years colony. How she come thus far north impossible say. The last entry log showed she latitude Caroline group; she deserted there, she must drifted several hundred miles. Tom Desmond concluded blacks must risen white crew, latter, defending desperately, must overcome, former probably swum shore. One thing certain, terrible tragedy enacted board. The dead bodies could tell tales; probably fallen struggle left companions. Perhaps blacks, murdering crew, steered northward, fancying islands lay direction. "We may suppose anything like," said Tom; "but shall get nearer truth. However, take care log, see anything got it. We see vessel contains anything likely useful, is, must send fetch without delay, another gale might knock her pieces." Before could continue search come take fresh air; descended little cabin. No sooner commenced search found set carpenter's tools, parcels nails, several articles required repairing boat. "These indeed treasures," said Tom, he examined them. "Now, find cask tar, shall fortunate." "That likely forward, hold," said Desmond. "Ugh! I do not like go hold," said Tom; "but must go down, find want forward." Nearly articles wanted cabin: quadrant, chart, canvas rope, sail-maker's needles, twine--indeed, almost everything could possibly require. They placed, ready packing up, things value them, tools, quadrant, chart, spy-glass, articles. They then, unwilling remain longer board necessary, made way forward. Almost one first objects eyes encountered examined fore hold cask tar, got apparently use; also oil, turpentine, white lead, brushes. "I wish time skill, might, instead repairing boat, built another better fitted intended voyage. Perhaps could get vessel off?" suggested Desmond. "You would say saw her high tide, water must flow her, her bottom like sieve," answered Tom. "We must think launching her, building another boat; may improve craft, make her thoroughly seaworthy." As tackles hand, hoisted tar-barrel deck; time impossible remain longer board, therefore, valuable articles two parcels, Tom first descended, Desmond lowered side him. Altogether packages weighed good deal; but, delighted acquisition, trudged along right merrily, hoping get back night. "We shall astonish them," exclaimed Desmond, "when see us things brought." They little difficulty getting back, frequently stop rest; eager join comrades, persevered, length, night closed them, caught sight welcome fire cliff. Pat concocted potful turtle soup, yams roasting embers. He rest could scarcely believe eyes saw treasures Tom Desmond brought. The men eager set next day. Tom, however, determined go boat, landing-place far off, weather promised fine. Next morning accordingly launched boat, carrying several cocoa-nut shells bale her out, forgetting take also supply provisions. The wind land, water smooth; setting sail, skimmed merrily along outside reefs, keeping bright look might surface. The disagreeable part expedition necessity keeping two bands constantly baling. This showed utterly impossible would attempted proposed voyage boat repaired. They found sandy beach quarter mile wreck. Here hauled boat up, hands eagerly hastened board. Pat suggested first thing done bury bodies, might search hold without inconvenience; he Tim agreed perform disagreeable task. Having found old sail, placed remains it. Among articles board couple spades, dragged bodies piece soft ground inside rocks, quickly dug grave, white man blacks placed together. "They will fight there," said Tim, "whatever may done life them." The hold washed down, cases gun-powder found, Tom devoted portion fumigating hold. They able search vessel thoroughly. Almost everything could possibly require discovered her. Still Tim seen searching about, eagerly first. At length he gave shout. "Hurrah!" he cried out, "here treasure, boys;" he produced box tobacco, still considerable portion original contents. "It serve us many day come." Some pipes also found, Tom gave men leave take smoke, truly grateful unpleasant duty performed. The midshipmen mean time engaged selecting articles considered would use, accident happen wreck could return, might events secured necessary things. In Tom's eyes cask tar valuable. The voyage apparently long one, nearly provisions exhausted. A small barrel biscuit, pieces beef bottom cask, almost provisions remaining board. There was, however, tea, coffee, sugar, forget carry cooking utensils, well cups, plates, tea-pot, knives forks, also several articles clothing, would enable enjoy luxury change linen. Tom first thought shifting head-quarters little bay boat drawn up; consideration, exposed situation, he Desmond agreed return original camp. They found sufficient amount planking raise boat's gunwales, put small deck forward lockers aft. Altogether highly satisfied treasures obtained, laden boat, put off. The wind favouring them, pleasant sail back bay. It night time landed stores conveyed articles food encampment. Tom Desmond much better spirits before. They now, could make boat seaworthy, great hopes performing intended voyage. They good store provisions, compass, chart, quadrant, almanac, could direct course direction considered advisable. They still doubt whether go Ladrones steer Japan. In latter case would likely fall English man-of-war, voyage must difficult, finally decided guided winds state weather. Japan certainly nearer, might make port Englishmen settled, uncertain might treated natives. They hoped, too, _Dragon_ might escaped managed reach Ladrones, where, she would without doubt remain time, might able rejoin her. None party, unfortunately, much practical knowledge carpentering. Pat, lived long among savages, skilful accustomed turn his hand sorts work. They trusted, however, success right exercise wits. They make couple trips wreck, bring away various articles thought might use. They then, without loss time, commenced operations. The first task fix false keel, half foot depth, enable boat sail closer wind she would otherwise able do. It took time, greatly afraid injuring original keel. Fortunately, found long screws, much assisted them. "I bright idea," said Tom, begin. "We will nail length first place two inches deep, firmly secure iron hoops side keel, run screws, risk splitting keel." This plan carried out. "To mind, carpenter could done better," exclaimed Jerry, he surveyed work. The fore-part boat next decked over, piece canvas nailed top it, well painted, thus rendering perfectly water-tight. On principle formed large lockers aft, another amidships, heavier previsions could stored. These made water-tight, would materially assist keeping boat afloat heavy sea break board her. The gunwale raised foot round, bulwark placed athwartships, abaft forecastle deck, which, extending feet aft, sliding hatch fitted, reality boat half decked over. They lastly gave her thick coat tar outside, two coats paint inside. She rigged mainsail, mizen, foresail, added sliding bowsprit, jib could set light winds, flying gaff topsail. Having plenty canvas spars, also fitted square sail; sand-bags served ballast, although stores intended take would reader first unnecessary. Tom had, however, half dozen spare ones made, could filled beach island might touch, stores became exhausted. Altogether craft made thoroughly seaworthy. They working hard day, last touch given, critical examination she pronounced complete. "Now, lads, launch her," cried Tom. By means rollers placed her keel, done without much difficulty, hands jumped board. Ballast placed her, she found make drop water. "For part," exclaimed Tom, anxious encourage rest, "I ready sail right across Pacific her." "And I," cried Billy Desmond chorus. "Pardon saying it, sir; two things cannot carry enough that--water fresh provisions," said Jerry Bird, oldest seaman party. "If meet hurricane heavy gale boat, might course get across. Such voyages performed now, man would willingly undertake one could avoided." These observations Jerry set Tom thinking. "We must calculate quantity water carry, go allowance first," he said Desmond. "We must also regard yams provisions, or, pains taken, might run short, would pleasant." "I think not," remarked Billy. "I do not mind long remain boat, I like short commons." The weather promising fine, boat anchored close shore, also secured additional warp fastened stake driven ground. Their intention carry provisions stores board next morning immediately sail. With writing materials he found board schooner, Tom wrote short account adventures, intentions _future_ proceedings, corked paper bottle. This lashed carefully stake close flag-staff, felt sure would visited vessel come island. "At events, friends day learn become us lost," said Desmond. "Oh, pray do not talk that," cried Billy; "I cannot bear think about, anything dreadful." It time Tom, felt responsibility undertaking resting his shoulders, could go sleep. He thought done, he act various circumstances might occur. Just first streaks dawn appeared sky, he awoke. He immediately got went look state weather. As far he could judge, sheltered position hut, fine days past. "Thank Heaven, shall commence voyage favourable auspices, events," he said himself. Then he shouted-- "Rouse there, rouse up!" His companions quickly foot. Billy wanted breakfast immediately. Tom would hear it. "No, no, must get cargo board, take last breakfast beach," he answered. The party loaded various articles taken hut. The heavier stores housed close beach. Tom took look round see nothing left behind. They set boat, floated calm water bay. Some time occupied loading her stowing stores judiciously away, first required might uppermost. Their live stock last articles carried board, consisting couple turtle, hoped would live serve fresh provisions. The survivors pen allowed scramble back water, proceeding Billy sighed deeply. "Cannot tow us," he said, "or haul board might want them, calms make tow us?" "Bosh!" answer Tom made Billy's remark. It considerable anxiety Tom watched depth stores, placed board, gradually brought boat. They still water cocoa-nuts pigskins bring board. He, soon saw meet bad weather might heave overboard considerable portion; still, long sea remained smooth, she considered much overloaded. Pat lighted fire beach, party sat take last breakfast shore. It hearty one, may supposed, could venture one hot meal day. They found small cooking apparatus board wreck, could heated either oil-lamp wood chips. "All hands board," cried Tom length. He stood last beach. Having gain cast eye around see nothing left behind, he gave look boat. "She indeed deep water--almost deep," he said himself. "She will, however, I trust, weather gale likely meet with. We must, events, run risk, trust providence take care us." Having cast warp, Tom waded boat got board. Before giving order weigh anchor, he saw everything properly stowed, chart, quadrant, compass locker ready use. The wind bay light, colour water outside, could seen breeze blowing, though quarter difficult determine. "Now, lads, get anchor pull away offing, though one cheer go island home." A cheerful hurrah burst lips party, anchor lifted stowed, oars got out, pulled merrily harbour. The entrance passage smooth rest bay. Having length got well offing, Tom Desmond decide direction steer. The chart showed Guam, principal Ladrone Islands, much Yokohama, coast Japan, towards proposed steering. The wind, too, north-east, continue point, might reach place latter islands, much sooner could hope arrive Guam. Still, taken heads _Dragon_ would touch Guam, far inclined go Japan. When Tom, however, considered risk running short water fresh provisions, he decided ought attempt reach Japan. Desmond agreed him, he accordingly put boat's head north-west. The wind light jib gaff-topsail set, boat which, distance, would looked like little cutter, stood well her canvas. "She it, sir," said Jerry Bird. "She going better four knots hour now, comes stiff breeze, shall get six her." Tom quite sanguine that; indeed, he came heave log he fitted, he found she making really three half knots, though that, considering lightness wind, good. The little island spent many days drew gradually astern. They could see others away northward. They concluded also uninhabited, or, people them, likely afford assistance. At last island faded sight, sun went floated midst watery circle. Tom, Desmond Jerry Bird, taken helm one another, Billy experience, neither men could trusted steer compass. As got dark Tom wisely took gaff-topsail jib, he kept hand always ready lower mainsail, sudden squall strike boat. There appeared little chance, however, that, scarcely sun gone wind fell perfect calm, boat lay motionless water. "Do not think would well take oars?" asked Desmond. "If certain making good passage direction. I say so, exerting strength must see quarter wind next blow. It may teeth, labour vain." Tom divided crew two watches: he, Billy, Pat taking one; Desmond, Jerry Bird Tim, other. Tom took first watch, he idea weather would change midnight. "You need sit up, Billy," he said. "If wanted I will call you. Tim tend main halyards keep look-out forward." Billy, always ready _caulk_, lay stern sheets. Tim kept awake alternately singing snatches Irish songs whistling. Tom difficulty keeping awake. He lighted binnacle lamp, he saw boat's head turned one, another point compass. Several times he got look about; though sailing vessel could near them, steamer might, often often he fancied he heard sound one distance. Hour hour passed by; he looked his watch, fortunately kept good time. At midnight he roused Desmond, charging keep good look sudden squall. "Which way may come impossible say, I think likely point steering," he observed. Bird opinion. "We will caught napping, sir," he said, Tom lay down, thankful prospect getting rest. Desmond managed keep awake, amused listening Pat Casey's yarns, extraordinary Desmond fancied he must drawing upon his imagination, though he think fit say so. The middle watch passed away much first done. Now whale vast fish heard blowing splashing water, nothing could seen, sound travelling smooth surface great distance. "We let first watch sleep out," said Desmond. "It pity rouse daylight, though you, Pat, lie down." "Shure, it is tongue that is kept hard work, get along well without rest, leave I will sit keep Jerry company," answered Irishman. Scarcely hour this, Desmond, fancied he awake, sitting near tiller, his hand placed mechanically it, he felt suddenly move. There rushing sound, boat heeled slowly over. Tom, even his sleep felt movement, jumped up, finding boat heeling over, "Let go main-sheet," he shouted Pat, who, land dreams, neglected lower away main halyards. Once aroused, he quickly obeyed order, boat happily righted. Fortunately, stores well stowed, nothing shifted, might gone hard them. Tom's first act look compass. The wind, he expected, north-west. Desmond keeping boat close starboard tack, heading away southward west. "I afraid so," exclaimed Tom. "However, try do. Perhaps shift old quarter; holds does, shall dead beat Yokohama, may many long day get there. We give fair trial, however, case wind change." Daylight soon came. Tom gazed anxiously around. "We heave go breakfast. Should wind continue couple hours, bear run Guam. It sign us must destination." Having boiled kettle, took first breakfast board boat. "Follow example, make good one," said Billy. "If comes blow, heave cargo overboard, well save much possible." The men, events, inclined follow midshipman's advice; breakfast Tom got his chart pricked course present position. "With wind shall soon sight Bonins, shall lost much time. We shall, I hope, make Bailey Islands dark; course must south east, carry us clear several rocks reefs westward, I hope good breeze may sight one northern Ladrones course week ten days, Guam three hundred miles south." Desmond fully agreed Tom's proposal, time fixed arrived, wind blowing strongly steadily ever, helm put up, boat steered proposed course. Although Bonins seen, night came sighted Bailey Islands; Tom, afraid running dark, steered eastward he otherwise would done. Before first watch set he addressed his companions, urging one keep vigilant look ahead, day night. "We advantage, recollect, large vessel, rock reef may seen mast-head," he observed. "Should sea running, first intimation may danger may finding top coral rock. We must always ready, moment's notice, alter course, get oars wind fail us. By means may escape dangers must expect meet with. Remember, chart got old one may inaccurate, would unwise trust completely it." "Very important remarks, I hope men watch remember them, I shall myself," said Desmond. Though wind fair, ran night, main-sail, foresail, mizzen, case suddenly haul avoid danger upon might running. "As soon daylight set square sail, make lost time," said Tom. The wind held fair, towards morning began fall, daybreak perfectly calm. "Suppose wind springs next time southward, run north?" asked Billy. "Wait time comes," answered Tom. "We laid course Guam, Guam I hope shall reach day other." As sun rose heat became great, increased glare ocean, shone like sheet burnished gold. Having second suit sails, Tom mainsail rigged awning, which, sun got higher, served shelter heads, prevent risk sunstroke. The awning, however, could kept long remained calm, course required. Although progress might made rowing, Tom unwilling fatigue his crew, thinking better husband strength emergency might occur. At usual hour Tom piped breakfast, made last long possible. Tom's great difficulty find occupation hands. Unfortunately books except nautical almanac, interesting reading. Yarn spinning well evening men done work, go day either listeners narrators. Even singing songs becomes somewhat monotonous, especially list small singers already trolled forth again. Their chief amusement watching coveys flying-fish rose every ocean, darted air, bright scales glittering sun. Occasionally whale spouted forth jet vapour spray loud noise like emitted safety valve steam engine; albicores, bonitos; dolphins, various fish, could seen there, sporting tumbling, came surface, sending circle wavelets extending far wide around. Sea birds also flew blue ether, wings appearing snowy whiteness caught rays sun rapid flight. Jerry Bird proposed getting oars. "Maybe, sir, pull hours may fall craft becalmed; though may wish continue voyage boat, may talk her people, hear news, maybe get glass grog." "Or slice plum pudding, pot jam," put Billy. As appeared signs breeze springing up, Tom agreed Jerry's proposal, oars got out, Billy taking one them, Gerald promised take spell he got tired. Heavily laden, however, boat was, could scarcely send her ahead rate two knots hour; even something; supposing could row fifteen hours, night day, thirty miles might made good four twenty. Jerry, keep spirits his companions, led song, Tim Pat followed him; thus continued Tom piped dinner. They indeed seemed much happier nothing. As soon dinner took oars, pulled steadily dark; land seen, sail sight. Indeed, limited horizon, likely pass low islands without observing them. The night calm day; but, men required sleep, Tom kept two oars going. When sun rose next morning shone polished surface previous day. "Not air heavens," said Jerry, answer Tom's inquiries, he rose his sleeping-place stern sheets; "and, mind, will not be." "We must patience," said Tom, preparing take morning bath jumping overboard. "Be careful, sir, look sharks," observed Jerry. "I would not, I you, go far boat." "I follow advice. Keep oars splashing, frighten off, near," said Tom. Plunging in, midshipmen swam round round boat several times. Billy jumped overboard, opinion he likely prove tempting morsel Jack Shark, quickly begged Jerry help board again. The midshipmen dressed themselves, men imitated example. They splashing round beat, Pat shouted out-- "Bear hand; get board, mates. I caught sight fin big fellow twenty fathoms off; he will trying taste legs, do not look sharp." The midshipmen stood ready help men, also seen ominous black fin. Jerry, especial dread sharks, quickly threw gunwale, assistance Tom, Desmond Billy helped Tim. Pat, farthest out, caught hold bobstay hoisting board jibboom, cry dismay escaped him. "He nearly me, baste; I felt his jaws touch foot." That imagination proved blood running Pat's heel, lips, though fortunately teeth monster, struck him. A second later, Pat's foot would certainty. The shark directly afterwards seen swimming alongside boat casting malicious leer board. "It lesson us future swim away side," observed Tom. "It lesson go overboard all," said Billy. "_I've_ fancy become food shark." Another night passed. Tom found noon next day that, instead thirty, made good twenty miles. The fact times rowing all; others two oars going, one mile hour made, even four rowing, exert move boat rate two knots hour. Still progress made. They time reach northern Ladrones, might venture shore without fear killed eaten, would certainly lot islands south-west. Rowing day burning sun conducive health, though none party actually ill, began long breeze, would send rapidly course; spirits, hitherto kept up, also flagged considerably. Each day, too, made less progress former one, sign strength somewhat failing. They hitherto ample supply food. The salt junk found board wreck kept used case necessity. Of turtle, one killed, feasted couple days, remainder grew bad, compelled throw overboard. One morning Pat, taken charge animals, announced dead, died night, unless quickly eaten would lost. This proved case, especially Billy's regret, saw tempting morsels swallowed shark, had, since first appearance, followed boat. The still alarming announcement several hams, fancied well cured, also getting bad. Some consigned maw voracious shark, though others, slightly tainted, kept continued heat rendered uneatable. Pat could make out, discovered examination neither smoke salt penetrated depth, would done better cut meat thin strips attempted thus preserve it. "Well, shall fish enough roots, attack junk; must husband biscuit things," observed Tom. He accordingly put hands allowance. It small anxiety he examined cured fish, he grieved find emitted far pleasant odour; still, present eatable, he continued serve out. "It often I known calm last long this," exclaimed Jerry, whole week passed, breath air filled sails. "We would better shore known coming." "We grumble," observed Tom. "We got upwards hundred miles southward; breeze come shall much less distance make." "But food water, sir?" exclaimed Jerry. "We must touch nearest island sight obtain fresh supply," answer. Day day shark followed boat, his hideous snout seen, triangular fin his, would useless put fishing-line, would certainly carried off. When, however, fresh provisions ran short, Gerald Tom determined try get rid fearful foe. The three men Billy, who, though fat short, pulled good oar, rowing men task many hours, sort mechanical fashion, Tom exclaimed-- "Load muskets, Desmond, cannot kill brute astern, get slices his carcase, will, events, drive away." The muskets kept clean ready use. They soon loaded, midshipmen, bringing weapons shoulders, took, thought, steady aim fired. The shark instantly sank sight. Whether hit not, could tell, possible bullets, deflected water, glanced clear his head. They reloaded, expecting he would return; though looked clear water astern either side, monster nowhere seen. "He will not trouble us again," said Desmond. "I feel pretty sure bullet went him." "And I think mine did," said Tom; "but neither could killed him, he would floated up." "Then sooner get lines try catch fish supper better," exclaimed Billy. Taking heavy leads, two lines baited pieces rancid pork allowed tow astern. The lines time, bite obtained. "Perhaps lines deep enough, bait good be," observed Desmond, beginning haul upon his line. He got third length, he felt torn his grasp, he caught sight monster running it. The next instant, Desmond line round thwart, snapped short off. Away went hook line. Directly after, Tom's line, hanging quarter, without warning snapped off. "It is brute shark come back again," cried Tom. "Get muskets, Desmond, entice near, settle time." "He is knowing that, sir," observed Jerry. "You may fire away every shot you have got--he would see coming, way reach him." Tom, believing this, determined try more. He got another piece pork, fastened end one broken lines. "The hooks puzzle his inside," said Desmond, "when he begins feel them. He will think twice he another bite." The muskets loaded, midshipmen standing up, kept eyes closely watching bait, floated surface, two three fathoms astern. "There he comes," cried Desmond. And shark, turning his back, exposed white his belly, fired. The brute disappeared, bait, sinking like rocket lost sight. "We finished time, events," cried Desmond. "He will take hooks." "Yes, lost slices his back," cried Billy; "and, unless catch fish, shall short commons supper." Hoping troubled shark, fresh lines got out. No fish, however, took bait; either none came near, suited tastes. Supper consequently consisted biscuits tea; warm tea great comfort heat day. The watch kept lines night, still without success. Two days went little variation. Now hopes raised seeing ripple far away surface; but, caused wind, died away reached them. They short allowance water; skins either evaporated leaked out, store cocoa-nuts soon exhausted, boat's breaker, already commenced. A biscuits portion salt beef, best scarcely eatable, possessed slightly nutritive qualities, alone remained. Still enough keep alive three four days, perhaps longer; time, breeze spring up, might events reach Faralon de Pajaros, northern Ladrones. There small islands marked westward, one might sight; and, so, Tom determined land, try obtain water food might able find. They would likely able get shellfish rocks, would improvement junk. It night. Desmond watch, Tom lying fast asleep. He aroused hearing Desmond sing out, "A breeze! breeze! All hands make sail!" Tom moment his feet. He looked around stars. "From quarter come?" he asked. The binnacle lamp lighted. A light soon struck. Tom examined compass. "It dead us," he exclaimed, almost groan. "It coming strong too, sir," observed Jerry. "It would better set mainsail, see happens." As Jerry feared, wind became stronger, presently much boat could stagger under, her mizzen foresail set. The sea, however, heavy might expected. Tom kept boat's head close it, she rode easily fast-rising billows. The hatch, hitherto use, shipped, kept seas occasionally broke board. The boat much lighter she started; indeed, Jerry observed, "she would better sand-bags her bottom." Tom delighted her behaviour. "She rides beautifully seas," he exclaimed. "I sorry given her trial. The wind likely change long, shall quick run Faralon. I wish I knew it, get water cocoa-nuts shellfish there, must complain. We afterwards make way without difficulty Guam, plenty islands stop course." Tom said keep his spirits his companions. They yet begun suffer hunger, he well knew days unless could reach land. They none calculated contingency occurred. The gale continued day. At night sea went down, wind fell considerably, still blew southward. The boat put about, Tom Desmond agreed must try beat Faralon, might hope sight two three days utmost. By daylight wind fallen sufficiently enable set sail, agreed would better dead calm, might pulled boat direction wished go. At present, however, much wind enable that. Tom, hitherto bravely kept his spirits, began feel far happy, although he his best allow his companions discover this. He could help reflecting three four days water provisions must come almost end. They enough now, even keep strength, might still take two three weeks could reach island inhabited civilised people. He, however, his best communicate his feelings his companions. "I wish gone Japan," exclaimed Billy Blueblazes. "We long ago, I do not like short commons--that I do not." "I acted best," answered Tom. He could say another word: he felt his companions himself. The two Irishmen looking woe-begone. All Pat's fun left him; he strength enough tend jib sheets. Tim stationed foresail, Jerry stood main halyards. Tom Desmond, never played tricks constitutions, remarkably good ones, suffered much less rest, even felt growing weaker weaker. They day taken observation. According chart nearly Faralon, land appeared sight. Each day Tom lessened allowance food water; he took stock remained. Half dozen yams discovered, these, beaten oil, sustain life. It nauseous best, ate greedily. Another night came on; sea tolerably smooth, sky overcast, thick mist arose, although still blew fresh. The boat kept easy sail, close-hauled. Tom first watch Billy Pat. It unusually dark, difficulty he could see length boat. Before night came Tom examined chart. "I convinced noon--perhaps earlier--to-morrow latest, shall see land," he said. "I agree you," exclaimed Desmond. "On strength it, I propose glass grog apiece." "You will afther laughin' us, shure, Mr Desmond?" said Tim. "If could dhrop creature, would cheer hearts mightily." "Indeed, I not," said Desmond, producing bottle one lockers. It quarter full rum, even small portion mixed water Desmond served sufficient restore energy, almost exhausted party. The remainder he carefully put next day. After watch lay went sleep. Tom sat helm. Every he told Pat keep bright look out. "Arrah, sir, hard matter that, since I cannot see half fathom nose." "There cannot much use looking out," said Billy. "If near land seen dark; fallen single vessel since left Bonins, likely meet one to-night." "That is sound reasoning, Billy," answered Tom. "We must, fog lifts, make use ears eyes. We may hear breakers ahead time avoid listen attentively." They silent time. Tom's chief object speaking keep his companions awake. "Billy," he said, time, "did hear anything?" "Yes; I fancied I heard bell strike." "More once?" "Yes; four times." "So I," said Tom; he took his watch, intending look light binnacle lamp, instant lamp went out. The oil exhausted, can. Pat, he reason fear, taken pull unperceived. He struck match, saw ten of the clock. There could doubt, then, bell heard board ship; still faint she probably long way off. Tom could steer wind, which, however, he believed holding steady. He settled Desmond go four bells, keep starboard tack midnight, go about. He ordered Pat let fly jib sheet, put helm, when, boat stays, Pat sang out-- "A sail right ahead!" What Tom's horror instant see vast pyramid sail towering him. The next moment crash heard; stranger's stem struck boat's bow. At sound Desmond Jerry sprang feet. Instinctively knew run down, simultaneously uttered shouts "Help, help!" Ropes hove look-out men stranger's forecastle. Tom put one hands Billy, much alarmed know do, he grasped another. Pat caught hold dolphin striker, making his way bowsprit. Jerry grasped another rope, three swarmed met friendly hands assist them. Tom supposed Desmond Tim following, but, he looked back, his dismay see boat drifting away. The crash he heard convinced her side must stove in, she must sink almost immediately. "There two men clinging craft ran down, sir. In mercy's sake, lower boat pick up," he shouted out. "Aye, aye," answer. And he thankfully heard order given shorten sail bring ship wind. Rushing aft, he found party men preparing lower boat. He begged go her. Before she water Jerry joined him, and, together three hands, shoved off. He saw she whaleboat. One men, officer he concluded, took steering oar. "Desmond! Tim!" he shouted out. No answer came. The boat must gone down, could swim well. "Do know bearings?" he asked mate. "Aye, aye! I guess I do," answer. "We give another hail presently." The boat pulled on. Then Tom, standing again, halloed, rest party joining him. An answer came right ahead. Tom recognised Desmond's voice. With renewed zeal pulled looked around. Tom could distinguish boat gloom, water. "Bear hand," shouted Desmond again, boat. She gone almost over, her side water. Desmond clinging it. "Here, take first," he said; crew whaleboat lifted Tim board. Desmond sprang him. Scarcely got clear wreck boat she went down. "Thank Heaven, safe," exclaimed Tom, he rung Desmond's hand, long parted. "Did hear first hail?" "No; I suppose I dragging poor Tim up. He got blow head, I think, nearly slipping off. As boat broke clear ship I point hauling up, I could bear desert him." "Just like you," said Tom. "I hope he recover." "No fear that. We Irishmen good hard heads. If doctor board he soon bring round." "Have doctor board?" asked Tom mate. "I guess have; smart man he is, too," answered mate. "Are pick up?" "No, thank you," replied Tom; "all officers ship's company craft rescued." "What craft she?" asked mate. "The jolly-boat her Majesty's ship _Dragon_," answered Tom. "And happen here?" Tom explained lost ship, steering Guam, expected find her. "I guess you will that, put week ago, British man-of-war time." This unsatisfactory news. The mate time ask many questions boat alongside. Tom Desmond, reaching deck, found master, informed he Captain Paul Sibley--that ship boat run whaler _Columbia_, Boston. "I sorry accident," he added, "but I see one blame. It could helped. We could see you, could see us, course weakest went wall, rather bottom. However, board, welcome remain put board ship, set shore wherever wish land. I guess will not Solomon Islands New Hebrides, ugly fancy eating visitors." "Thank you," answered Tom. "If ship Guam, expect find her, must consider place would best land, soon possible may get board ship war." "Well, well, there, hurry," answered captain. "And now, best thing get wet clothes turn in. I shakedowns made young gentlemen state cabin, three men go forward, doctor look one broken head." Tom, Gerald, Billy thanked good-natured captain his kind offer, hinted that, nothing mashed yams oil last two days, thankful something eat. "Not pleasant fare. It is ill wind blows nobody good; so, though I ran down, better would starving food that, I guess. Here, Peter, light galley fire, get food quick possible. Hot tea mean time; look men forward--they want food much officers." The black steward, asleep, came rubbing his eyes, hurried obey orders he received; captain ushered his guests cabin, soon produced three blankets. "There, strip wet duds, wrap these," he said, "while I make beds." The three midshipmen, weary hungry were, indulged laugh, sat blankets them, like three Indian squaws looking other, kind captain completed arrangements he promised. The steward quickly returned pot hot tea, captain produced box American crackers, soon took edge appetites. "There, lie now, Peter able bring mere substantial fare," said captain. They followed his advice, Billy carrying handful crackers him, munching he soon fell fast asleep. They roused up, seemed them, moment afterwards steward, announced supper table; again, _unwillingly_, wrapped blankets, sat discuss basins hot soup slices cold beef, which, Billy observed, "was great improvement raw salt junk, long substantial fare." At length captain, observing three nodding table, advised return beds; scarcely put heads pillows, fast asleep. CHAPTER FOUR. KINDLY TREATED ON BOARD THE AMERICAN WHALER--LOOKING OUT FOR WHALES--A WHALE KILLED--CUTTING IN AND TRYING OUT--THE MASTER GOES OFF IN CHASE-- THE SECOND MATE LOST OVERBOARD--SANDWICH ISLANDER ENDEAVOURS TO SAVE HIM--THE BOATS DISAPPEAR--NO APPEARANCE OF THE MASTER AND FIRST MATE--A GALE--THE BOATSWAIN ASSUMES COMMAND AND PLAYS THE TYRANT--WILL NOT SEARCH FOR THE CAPTAIN--HIDES THE NAUTICAL INSTRUMENTS--THE BOATSWAIN DASHES TOM'S QUADRANT TO THE DECK--NIGHT--THE MIDSHIPMEN TURN IN--THE SHIP STRIKES--BOATSWAIN AND CREW PUT OFF--LEAVE TOM AND HIS COMPANIONS ON THE WRECK--WEATHER MODERATES--LAND SEEN--THEY BUILD A RAFT--VOYAGE TO THE SHORE--SEE A SAVAGE ON IT--TURNS OUT TO BE PAT CASEY--NIGHT ON SHORE. When Tom Rogers length awoke, he found captain, Doctor Locock (the surgeon), first mate seated dinner. "Well, young gentlemen, find well enough join us?" asked former. "Yes, sir," said Tom, slipping his clothes, he found perfectly dried his side. He aroused his companions, three soon seated table, plates laid them. They thankful hear doctor Tim, though still his hammock, fair way recovery, would deck day two. They gave fuller account adventures done previous night. The possible loss _Dragon_ discussed, captain mate's observations midshipmen's hopes somewhat raised she might escaped shipwreck. Their opinion that, her machinery damaged, she would run Hong-kong, nearest place could repaired; would take several weeks she could get back Bonins look them. That captain would return felt sure, unless he convinced lost. "At events, fish there, take look round neighbouring islands chance discovering wreck, rescuing her people may escaped," said master. "If fail that, may fall British man-of-war, shall put board. If not, land Yokohama Kagoshima, whence without difficulty get Hong-kong." Tom, spokesman, thanked captain his kindness, adding, "I feel sure British consul place may land us reimburse expense may put account." "We will not talk that, young friend," answered American captain. "We set loss boat that; I happy saved lives, rendered service power British officers distress, I tell belief would starved got Guam, island could landed Ladrones." "I guess do not value midshipmen long figure service," observed mate, he doubted _Dragon_ would return look them. "That depends sort midshipmen happen be," answered Tom, putting modest air. "We flatter likely neglected. Now, happened like Billy Blueblazes there, who, quantity beef he consumes, undoubtedly heavy cost her Majesty, captain might considered his duty leave us find grub future, thus save beloved country heavy expense." "I see," said mate wink, discovering Tom person he could take much change. "And pray may I ask young gentleman's name really Billy Blueblazes? It is curious sounding one, events." "It is name he known among us, events," answered Tom. "The captain may his supreme wisdom call Mr William Blewitt, he gazetted, obtaining his lieutenancy, he may possibly designated last-mentioned appellation; Billy Blueblazes he called his messmates he remains afloat." The midshipmen went short time deck, found Jerry Pat, seemed well pleased way treated crew, who, though rough enough appearance, far less seamen many merchant vessels. "They have, howsumever, already tried persuade Pat join them, lost two three men since came out; know, Mr Rogers, old man-of-war's man likely desert his flag, least join greasy, stinking whaler," said Jerry whisper, wishing overheard. Tom Gerald paid Tim visit, found almost again. "If you, Mr Desmond, I lost number mess--that I know; though I cannot make fine speech it, know Irishman's heart grateful. If ever come Barry Shingle, old mother I have got; couple sisters, showing think matter. I thinking, I lay here, sorrowing would held I got crack skull." On returning deck, Tom Desmond found Billy Blueblazes fast asleep companion hatch; could scarcely keep eyes open, followed captain's advice turned in, quickly forgot happened were. They awoke short time take supper, soon went sleep again. Indeed, even Tom felt he required sound rest two three nights, set hardships he gone through. The voyage _Columbia_ hitherto fortunate; she had, however, lost two her boats stove in, three hands drowned. She already half full, Captain Sibley hoped course months able return home. The midshipmen politely kindly treated, agreed ought thankful finding well off. They anxious, leaving ship, see whale captured, witness operation cutting trying in, doctor described them. Hitherto almost calm since came board. The ship slightly changed her position; still look-out kept whales, moment one might appear. The midshipmen asleep, one morning, daybreak, aroused sound feet hurrying overhead, springing deck, saw crew busily engaged lowering two boats. "There! again!" shouted look-out, meaning whale, he time seen, come surface spouting. Tom immediately sprang rigging, looking out, he saw whale spouting mile windward. In less minute people come deck half dressed, boats started away six men each, including headsman boat's steerer. The captain went headsman one, first mate other. The water bubbled hissed bows boats, eager crews urged forward. "I wish I gone one," cried Tom. "So I," said Desmond; "but I doubt whether found much use, captain would considered us way, little chance. However, see fun, get breeze may beat ship whale." The boats made good way, got near enough fire harpoons monster, sank beneath surface. "The whale disappeared! How provoking!" cried Desmond. "Do not suppose that. Depend upon it, captain given chase yet. The whale must soon come surface breathe," said Tom. He right. The whale rose great distance gone down, somewhat nearer ship. The boats quickly it, done spouting, two harpoons, deadly force, shot side. The boats backed speedily return strike number lances. The whale, feeling sudden pain, lifted flukes disappeared. The line quickly run out, long creature came surface attempted swim away foes; gone far, began furiously lash water flukes, beating mass foam blood. The boats kept clear, crews well knowing one blow mighty tail would dash boats splinters. It last effort monster, soon rolled side perfectly dead. A cheer boats' crews, heard water, announced success, when, securing tow-ropes whale, dragged alongside without loss time, operation cutting commenced. Two crew descended sharp spades, cut head whale, secured counter. A large hook fastened hole cut blubber head end animal, operator commenced cutting strip three feet broad, spiral direction, tackle fixed hook, drawn board, body whale turning round round. As blubber thus hoisted up, cut pieces, known, blanket pieces, thrown huge cauldrons arranged along deck. As soon carcase stripped this, outer coating, allowed float away, spermaceti oil head astern dipped small buckets end poles, whole extracted. This oil, valuable part whale, boiled separately, stowed casks. Now commenced operation trying out. Fires lighted huge try-pots, crisp membranous parts blanket, oil extracted, serving fuel. The blubber boiled oil rose surface, skimmed placed casks. In daylight men thus employed looked grim enough, night, worked away, stripped waists, fire casting glare smoke-begrimed figures, seemed like group demons engaged diabolical work, human beings. The midshipmen could scarcely recognise talking familiarly day before. The whale, large one, gave, captain told them, eighty barrels oil. It took crew upwards two days try stow away quantity. "I precious hard I turned whaler," observed Billy Blueblazes. "It hot work night, must terrible calm, blazing sun beating poor fellows' heads." Several days passed away another whale seen. A breeze, however, sprung up, ship stood northward. There sea weather looked changeable, one afternoon, Tom Gerald enjoying read captain's books cabin, Billy rushed in, exclaiming-- "Here is school whales close us. Come look them, perhaps off." Sure enough, midshipmen came deck, saw half dozen whales spouting together, which, captain told them, young bull whales. The crew standing ready lower boats soon get captain's order. The weather appeared clear little, eager obtain one frolicsome monsters, he determined, spite threatening aspect weather, go chase. He, before, went one boat, first mate other. The boats were, however, apparently seen whales, immediately separated went different directions. One, however, making several turns, came directly towards captain's boat. "'Faith! I wish him," exclaimed Desmond. "He sure one." The captain, making sign his men move oars, waited silently young bull, came close without discovering foe. When length so, swerved one side, moment receiving deadly weapon behind hump. No sooner whale feel pain than, apparently terror-stricken, seemed unable move; captain fire, suddenly recovering itself, darted like arrow, spinning boat quickly round she nearly upset. Away went whale dead windward, towing boat rate nearly fifteen miles hour, right head sea which, she ploughed it, formed high bank surf either side, she almost concealed showers spray flying her. The second mate, distance, seeing whale coming, pulled time shoot his weapon side, boats, fast, towed almost rapidly captain's. In vain boats attempted haul closer, strike lances deeply animal. Tom Gerald, borrowing spy-glasses, ran aloft watch proceedings, great speed whale gone that, short time, neither beats could seen naked eye. From mast-head midshipmen could observe three objects like specks upon ocean, length entirely disappeared beyond horizon. The wind freshened. "We must go lend hand," said Tom, "as I suppose second mate beat ship boats." They accordingly descended; half-way down, fearful cry reached ears "A man overboard!" On looking astern saw struggling waves. Who he could tell. Hastening deck, found helm put down, hands raising tacks sheets bring ship about. In mean time oars hen-coop hove sea, man, whoever he was, seemed little notion swimming, his efforts reach unavailing. Tom's first impulse leap overboard. Gerald, holding back, exclaimed, "You could save poor fellow; he would carry down, attempted get near him." "But I could tow hen-coop him," said Tom. "Stay are, young gentleman," said doctor. "See! man gone his assistance;" caught sight Sandwich Islander water. He slipped quietly overboard making his way towards drowning man. Just sun dipped beneath horizon, looking angry red, sky threatened stormy night. Only one small boat remained, lowered immediately; ship brought to, Tom, Desmond, Jerry, two crew, jumped her; time lost sight drowning man Sandwich Islander. The sea, every moment getting up, broke bows boat pulled towards spot men last seen. "Who poor fellow?" asked Tom one crew. "Our second mate. He queer time, I do not expect shall find him." This painful intelligence. Tom felt his duty persevere. At length heard cry. It came Sandwich Islander. They could see him, caught sight hen-coop, assisted directing course. Just Tom, taken bow oar, standing look out, saw two heads. "We shall time, even now. Pull away!" he sang out. The mate apparently got hold oar. "I see him," shouted Tom Sandwich Islander. "Wait another minute, take board;" he pointed towards mate. They twelve fathoms him, loud shriek escaped him, and, letting go oar, he threw his arms sank sight. They pulled round, still hoping he might re-appear, vain. The Sandwich Islander came swimming rapidly them, without waiting assistance threw bows. "A shark got him," he said; "and would another minute." It without danger swamped boat regained ship's side. Until return captain first mate ship command Mr Betts, boatswain, appeared rough hand; although Tom concluded he good seaman, would act best, endeavour get boats take officers board. Tom offered his his companions' services work ship. Indeed, she short-handed without assistance she could difficulty even put about. "I suppose eating owner's bread work owner," gruff answer, he declined offer himself. This, however, mattered little Tom. As wind increased he felt anxious fate absent ones. In order miss them, necessary make short boards, hands kept constantly work, putting ship every quarter hour, lanterns hung weather side show her whereabouts boats got clear whale. The gale became stronger stronger. The canvas taken in, ship closely reefed topsails. The sea got more, frequently breaking her bows, seemed probable boats, could reach her, would swamped. Already would difficult matter get alongside. Tom, discovered blue lights board, burnt one every then, hoping might seen encourage crews wave-tossed boats. The surgeon told he still hopes might escape, boats often done heavy sea, hanging lee dead whale, served breakwater. "In case must take care go far, may get windward them, might venture leave shelter whale affords them," observed Tom. On he proposed boatswain "heave to." "We yet," answer. "I sea born, young gentleman. Leave judge best done." Tom made reply. "We got queer character deal with," he observed Desmond. "However, must try manage him, although serious matter us, well board, recover poor captain mate." No one turned in; indeed, hands required put ship about, night long she kept tack tack without answering signal. The doctor continued fire intervals one six-pounder guns deck, signal heard return. When morning broke, boatswain length consented heave to. Neither boats seen, board began despair. The gale showed signs abatement, sea continued increase. High-tossing waves, crested foam, rose around, sky obscured dense masses dark clouds. "Will whaleboats live sea like this?" asked Tom boatswain, his character commanding officer standing aft. "I guess could, young man, handled know handle them," answer. "Then may still hope find captain mate," observed Desmond. "If whale smash one boats her flukes. If he did, twelve people would prove heavy cargo sea like this, she likely enough swamped." "I afraid accident must occurred," observed Tom. "I guess may far wrong," unsatisfactory remark. On going cabin breakfast found Doctor Locock resting his head his hands, his elbows table. "Poor Captain Sibley! He gone, I fear. I would given I possess save him. A kinder-hearted man never commanded ship. His poor wife children! And second mate gone! Only rough diamond charge, without men enough handle ship. It prove serious matter us, I fear, young gentlemen, even ride present gale bad weather continue." "With party six shall difficulty managing ship," observed Tom. "My eldest messmate I thorough navigators; though cannot assist following object voyage, shall able take her port she obtain another master, officers men. I propose steering Hong-kong, certain fall American merchantmen, probably man-of-war; but, leave neighbourhood, I wish make thorough search missing boats. Notwithstanding boatswain says, I satisfied lost." "Do think possible escaped?" asked surgeon, looking up. "I think possible, though I dare say probable," answered Tom. "They may killed whale hung lee body, may run wind succeeded reaching one small islands eastward. The weather thick might easily passed us without discovering signals." These remarks Tom's greatly cheered poor surgeon, grieved loss his friend captain, he also naturally anxious his fate. "With man Betts I less fear; I know obstinate, self-opinionated, unprincipled fellow, ignorant time," he observed. "If he utterly ignorant navigation would less danger; he knows something it, idea he first-rate navigator, fully capable taking charge ship." "We must take observations keep reckoning carefully, may able correct his errors," said Tom. As he spoke, gruff voice heard exclaim, "What is say?" boatswain, standing door cabin, walked in, casting furious glances doctor three midshipmen. "So think I know nothing navigation, you?" exclaimed man. "I will soon show I know, cabin mine, unless keep civil tongues heads, shall go find berths forward." Tom, remembering soft answer turneth away wrath, replied, "We wish dispute authority, Mr Betts, shall glad give assistance power. If captain here, mates lost, he would wished us take observations help navigate ship." "The captain one man, I another. He might liked will not suit fancy. So now, I am captain, I will beg keep hands pockets receive orders take out. You understand me?" Desmond, much inclined keep his temper Tom, firing boatswain's impudence, Tom put his hand his mouth, turning boatswain, said, "Very well, Mr Betts; understand other. But without boats, even people able help, could attempt catch whales, even sufficient number men take ship home, must put port get fresh hands. If take advice will, soon gale over, shape course Hong-kong, leave part ocean I would strongly urge make diligent search directions boats." "We might well look needle bundle hay. The boats swamped, I am sure that, do not intend lose time hunting shall never find," answered boatswain, he took captain's seat table. Tom considerable difficulty restraining Desmond saying anything might irritate man. Billy ate his breakfast silence, stowing away ample supply provender ready emergencies. The doctor made remark, fearful lest anything he might say irritate boatswain, he knew capable act tyranny. As soon meal over, Tom Desmond went deck. "I would not give way fellow," exclaimed latter. "He will wanting us take ship round Cape Horn Boston, get credit bringing her home himself. The best thing clap irons take command ourselves. The doctor would side us, would two three ship's company, them; for, depend upon it, must aware he navigator, would wish trust craft him." Tom, averse proceeding, replied, "It might turn well first fall British man-of-war; suppose met American, might accused running away ship. Rest assured boatswain men would ready swear anything would suit purposes." "I would risk that," said Desmond. "The doctor's word would taken boatswain, American officer would see statement true one." "Suppose fail attempt seize boatswain, he would murder us all, events clap us irons, accuse us mutiny attempt seize ship." "Arrah! now, what is come you, Tom?" exclaimed Desmond. "You will persuade you are afraid carrying plan." "No," answered Tom, smiling. "I want look sides case, Archie Gordon would done he us. I fully agree you, fellow refuses go Hong-kong must compel means other; but, would wrong us seize ship unless assured incapacity boatswain, her safety lives board would imperilled. In case justified acting propose." "And is not he incompetent?" exclaimed Desmond. "The doctor says so. If he good navigator he would serving boatswain." "If he agree go Hong-kong Sydney, even Sandwich Islands, let us assist navigating ship, well good, leave her places, he obtain fresh crew." Tom's remarks satisfied Desmond ought wait see boatswain would act. A look-out kept every direction boats, hours went still appear. As day drew wind began abate, sea proportionately go down. The boatswain turned captain's berth gone sleep, one felt inclined awaken him. Tom, Desmond, Billy constantly going mast-head look missing boats, still hoping might appear. Desmond gone cabin, he heard boatswain snoring loudly. He returned deck. "Now would time seize fellow," he said Tom. "The doctor brace pistols fowling-piece. I found another brace first mate's berth. I speak Jerry, he easily let Tim Pat know doing. Peter, I certain, would side us way he looked he saw boatswain take captain's seat. The rest men would easily over; not, clapped boatswain irons, must make prisoners. We easily tackle watch deck, master come up." "Your plan good one, I dare say would succeed, I hope shall carry out," said Tom. "We proof boatswain act reasonably, I repeat I consider justified taking ship he shown his conduct he likely endanger lives, rest board." The midshipmen part deck themselves, ship hove to. Only two crew could seen; one boatswain's mats, who, carpenter, men remaining board capable taking charge watch. Tom Desmond wishing boatswain would come up, order might learn direction steer. They indeed getting sleepy could scarcely keep eyes open, much longed lie down, even couple hours. At last boatswain made his appearance. "May I ask, Mr Betts, intend doing?" said Tom, polite tone he could command. "What is you?" asked boatswain, gruffly. "You passengers, go ship goes." "I intention dictating you," replied Tom; "but passengers, naturally wish learn likely get shore." "That must depend upon circumstances," said boatswain, evasively. "I command ship, intend keep it, unless captain mate come board." "We perfectly ready obey you, assist carrying ship, either Hong-kong, Honolulu Sandwich Islands, Sydney, may obtain fresh hands take her home, I ask tell ports intend steer." "I made mind upon matter," answered boatswain. "Perhaps expect may still find captain boats crews; work windward night, run back to-morrow course, may fall them, kept afloat gale," said Tom suggestively, he afraid saying course he would advise. "Wait see I do," said boatswain. "As may wanted deck, I advise turn get sleep; ship hove now, I tell, hove she remain hours longer." Tom Desmond agreed better follow boatswain's advice, accordingly went below. They found Billy Blueblazes snoring away, troubling likely happen. Throwing beds, another minute fast asleep. They expected called keep watch; one arousing them, fatigued were, slept daylight. Tom first awaken; he roused Desmond Billy, three went deck together, found wind freshened old quarter, ship standing close hauled eastward. The carpenter charge deck, could get nothing him. The doctor soon afterwards came up. Tom inquired whether he knew boatswain's intentions? "He thought fit enlighten me, I conclude course he steering he intends visiting Sandwich Islands," answer. "I wish he thought fit steer opposite direction," observed Tom. "However, may perhaps find one ships there, reason complain." "I hope keep intention taking observation every day, ascertaining position," said doctor, low voice, he might overheard. "You may depend upon that," answered Tom. "I conclude tell whereabouts are?" said doctor. "Not unless I learn hour sail made began stand present course," reply. When Tom inquired carpenter, he received evasive answer, going forward learn Jerry, Tim, Pat, said gone night, roused up. Some crew replied first watch, others middle watch. "At events, I hope ascertain latitude weather clears, perhaps may get observation afternoon, lunar night," said Tom. "But good look-out must kept ahead, I know numerous small islands reefs, one may bring us careful." The doctor assisted midshipmen search sextant nautical almanack, but, surprise, neither found. "The chronometer was," doctor said, "he knew, captain's cabin;" last began suspect boatswain managed get hold mate's well captain's sextant charts, shut cabin he appropriated. What his object difficult say, unless he thought he keep midshipmen his power preventing knowing whereabouts were. Just breakfast boatswain came his cabin, carefully locking door behind him. After remaining deck time, he returned took his seat without uttering word either surgeon midshipmen, although he swore away Peter quick enough bringing he asked for. Tom took notice this, waiting time, said his usual polite way-- "I much obliged you, Mr Betts, supply sextant, use chronometer, I like ascertain position." "Then will not obliged me, I do not intend let them," answered boatswain. "I take care ship, I will not one interfering me." "I wish interfere," said Tom. "I desire take observation satisfaction." "Then will not satisfaction," said boatswain. Desmond bit his lip, Tom expected hear every moment say something, would sure enrage boatswain. "At events, I get look chart, I shall able calculate although may prevent obstinate fellow running ship reef, mercy her fate," thought Tom. "I believe man gone his mind," said Desmond, he found alone his two messmates. "It pity put irons first, might way Hong-kong." "We right," observed Tom, "and whatever happens satisfaction." They hunted chart, boatswain locked also, refused allow Tom look it. The wind continued tolerably steady day, though weather looked unsettled, sea appeared getting up. As ship kept her topsails spanker, two reefs down, fresh sail made, boatswain order midshipmen perform duty. The doctor seemed feel loss captain much. He morning entertained hope finding him, he abandoned, confidence boatswain's skill navigator, he seemed made his mind ship would cast away, board would lost. He hitherto appeared cheerful disposition, he sat day moodily his cabin, book him, although his eye scarcely glanced pages. Tom Gerald tried induce come deck, he shook his head, declaring he feel able walk. Billy endeavoured amuse telling one his funny stories, smile came poor doctor's face. At dinner midshipmen conversation themselves. The boatswain address even word them. This not, however, disconcert least, continued talking away person present, he well pleased get go deck. The weather continued couple days. The boatswain kept watch midshipmen prevent taking observation. Billy, however, found quadrant second mate's cabin, watching his opportunity Mr Betts below, brought deck Tom Gerald. They fortunately carefully compared watches chronometer, doctor concealed nautical almanack. "Arrah!" exclaimed Desmond; "we shall able make something observation, although correct wish." Tom took quadrant looking it, he suddenly felt dashed his hand, falling deck broken. Turning round he saw Mr Betts, stolen behind him. "So fancy I cannot navigate ship, you; must needs try take observation yourself? Do mates try prank again, I will land first island sight, may follow pleasure, savages do not knock head eat you; one does not take off, likely, remain end days." Gerald beginning answer rude address, Tom stopped him. "We wish dispute you, Mr Betts, though perfect right take observation, anything else interfere discipline ship," said Tom, he turned away, feeling better avoid dispute boatswain. Tom accordingly signing his companions, left deck, allowing boatswain pace himself. Towards evening he sent steward them, told he expected three keep middle watch. "Your men first watch," he said, "and I would advise deck directly called." As reason object agreed boatswain wished. They accordingly turned first part night. They asleep time fearful crash heard. They, three awake, quickly slipped clothes. "I knew would so," exclaimed doctor, met cabin; "we shall none us see another sunrise." "I hope things will not bad that," said Tom; "the ship seems moving forward; perhaps she merely touched coral reef scraped clear. We go deck ascertain matters stand." The cries shouts reached cabin showed something serious happened. Scarcely Tom his companions gained deck, ship struck greater force before, every timber quivering stem stern. The foremast went board, carrying main-topmast, sea striking ship swept her. The wild shrieks help followed showed crew borne away. "Can see land?" asked Desmond Tom. "No; coral reef, chances escape small." Just heard boatswain shouting crew lower boat, one remaining. "Do not let us go her," said Tom; "if ship holds together, shall better are: daylight comes form raft, land near may get it." Both Desmond Billy agreed Tom proposed. Just Jerry came up. "I will stick you, whatever intend doing," he answered, Tom told he proposed. In mean time, boatswain, survivors crew, lowered boat, throwing various things her. Jerry made Tim Pat among people go off. "Where going to?" he shouted. "Mr Rogers says he will stick wreck, you will deserting him, I hope?" "That I will not. Tim Nolan man desert his officer," answered Tim, he made his way part ship, Jerry was. Pat either hear Jerry, determined go boat he could. The doctor Peter, come deck, seemed undecided. It evident dislike Peter boatswain he unwilling accompany him. The boatswain, six men, alone remained crew, disappeared side boat. The doctor, seized sudden impulse, rushed side ship, shouting-- "Take you! take you!" oars got out, boat shoved off, already tossing among broken water lee ship, several fathoms off. "You safer wreck boat," said Tom, doctor came back. "Dat are, Massa Locock," said Peter. "See dare de boat go." Through gloom boat could distinguished, surrounded leaping masses foaming water. The party board watched her anxious eyes, she disappeared darkness. "Hark!" cried Peter. "Me tink I hear shriek; dat come de boat; depen' upon see her 'gan." As, however, she must time long way leeward, Tom thought impossible human voice could come wind still blowing did. Tom Desmond, rest party, discussed probability were. They must passed sunken reef, ship first struck, run right another part reef, somewhat higher, she become fixed. This probably inner lee side. Though sea broke fore part ship, part tolerably dry, hopes entertained she would hold together hours, and, wind go down, perhaps days, would enable provide safety. After doctor sufficiently recovered take part discussion, he suggested perhaps she might got off. "You would not say that, sir, forward she struck," answered Jerry. "She entirely stove in, must twelve fourteen feet water her time. It hard job long get provisions." "Then sooner set better," said Tom, "if manage find way dark." "De lamp de cabin still 'light--me get him," said Peter, soon returned, carefully shading lamp, he, Jerry, Tim made way below, hoping reach fore hold, bulk provisions stowed. They were, however, soon convinced would utterly impossible get anything tide fallen, sea rushing bows, completely flooding hold. "Then must try daylight, present would useless attempt getting anything up. We see, however, found afterpart ship." Peter recollected eases biscuits articles, necessary keep dry. His report encouraged Tom hope starve. "Now, lads, first thing collect spars loose plank get hold of, form raft. We likely find land either one side other, perhaps far off, though unable see now, must manage reach carry provisions support, likely find much cocoa-nuts fish. One satisfactory thing people hereabouts cannibals, generally disposed friendly white men, island may reach inhabited likely ill-treated." Tom remarks keeping his spirits, prevented his companions losing theirs. Even doctor began hope might escape. All hands set work collect materials raft far could done dark, drag weather side quarter-deck, much risk carried away. Altogether managed secure number spars pieces bulwarks good supply rope various sizes. The cabin bulk-heads portions vessel could easily torn away would give wood enough make raft sufficient size carry whole party well provisions. By lashing underneath two rows casks, would sufficiently buoyant. They thus employed daylight, Tom, sprung poop look out, exclaimed--"A ship sight! ship sight! she is hull down." His shout brought rest party around him, eagerly looking direction pointed. As daylight increased, Tim began rub his eyes-- "Arrah now, ill-luck it; ship turned white rock," he cried out. "Shure it is mighty disappointment." The expectation speedy deliverance thus suddenly destroyed; shipwrecked party continued looking round every side, hope discovering land. The light yet increasing, Tom's countenance brightened he observed looked like masts ship rising, far off, water. "Why, I believe three cocoa-nut trees," he cried cheerfully. "I see several others away eastward." "If cocoa-nut trees, must land too, do not grow sea," said Billy, "and I hope may able get there." "You need doubt that," said Tom. This announcement raised every one's spirits. The weather much moderated. The sea reef ship lay land tolerably smooth. The forlorn party began cheer up. All began feel hungry. "I will tell is: do not get something eat soon, I one shall die inanition," exclaimed Billy. "I cannot stand starving best times, I suffering dreadfully." "We see done, Billy," said Tom, matter course, he told Peter get breakfast ready. "Yes, massa officer, soon dat same," answered black, grinning looking towards caboose lately stood. "Me try de cabin," he added, diving below. Though caboose washed away Peter managed light fire cabin stove cook tolerable breakfast, thankfully partook. "'Faith! we are badly all," observed Gerald. "If boatswain poor fellows stuck ship, might alive reached land without difficulty." Immediately breakfast began put raft together, Tom determined form oblong shape like catamaran, might, wind fair, sailed propelled paddles towards shore. As distance considerable, important make strong possible, stand amount sea likely meet reached shore. It took upwards hour form frame-work deck it. They then, cut away bulwarks, launched overboard capstan bars. The water lee wreck tolerably smooth, raft remained alongside without injury. They next lash casks it. This difficult operation, necessary secure firmly proper positions, row side, head head. When completed, platform floated well water. Three oars could found board, form paddles nailing boards ends short spars. The next work rig masts. Tom Desmond agreed two masts bowsprit, might able sail wind abeam. The masts firmly fixed means blocks nailed deck, set stays. By noon raft completed. The midshipmen surveyed her considerable satisfaction. "I one mind sailing her anywhere, provided she well provisioned," said Billy Blueblazes. "I do not see try fetch Ladrones, do not find comfortable going." "I would strongly advise make attempt, young gentlemen," said doctor, groan, he well satisfied appearance raft his younger companions. "We shall see she behave she her cargo board, get way," said Tom. "Do not think better dinner shove off?" asked Billy; "it will not going away without grub, may time reach shore." Billy's proposal agreed to, although Tom strongly recommended unnecessary delay. While Peter preparing dinner, stores could collected placed raft lashed securely amidships. The principal provisions found aft biscuits, tins potted meats, preserves, coffee, tea, sugar, five well-cured hams. "We pretty well is," said Desmond; "but do not let us go without firearms." The doctor fowling-piece, muskets pistols enough found arm rest party. With good supply ammunition would thus, meet hostile savages, able keep bay. They already secured provisions sufficient last several weeks. As important, however, obtain substantial character, Jerry Tim volunteered dive fore hold try get casks beef. This, labour little risk drowning themselves, succeeded doing, two casks beef hoisted deck. They fortunately came upon two casks, one flour rice, which, although damaged water, might dried shore sun, rendered eatable. These accordingly added provisions. Two cases wine small keg spirits also put board. Peter added cooking utensils, cups, plates, knives, forks. At length, Tom declared raft would carry more. It high time indeed set off, might take dark reach land sight. "Let advise you, gentlemen, carry clothing blankets; weigh much, may want them," observed doctor. His advice followed. "We must get board shove off," cried Tom, last. His messmates men obeyed him, fully eager he was. The doctor below; he presently appeared his medicine chest instrument case, handed down. "Why, going without chart nautical instrument!" exclaimed Tom, reminded his negligence seeing doctor's cases. He Desmond returned board found chart, sextant, chronometer, boatswain fortunately carried off. "The raft fully laden she be," observed Tom Desmond; "we arrange things heave overboard, comes blow she cannot carry all." "The doctor's physic, cases, instruments, I say," answered Desmond; "however, I hope shall that. The weather looks promising. As wind fair, may soon reach land." These remarks made deck. The two midshipmen sprang board raft. Tom gave order cast off, hands getting oars paddles, raft began move away wreck. The foresail set, mainsail jib, Tom steering long oar, raft glided rapidly smoothly water. Their voyage thus far well commenced, Tom Desmond could help recollecting late adventure boat, narrowly escaped perishing hunger, although well supplied provisions started. While Tom steered, Billy remained aft tend main-sheet, Desmond, Jerry, stood forward keep look-out reefs might sufficient water allow raft pass over. No dangers, however, yet appeared ahead. They apparently centre large circular reef, island hoped gain formed portion. They expected find beach might run raft, land cargo without difficulty. They were, however, far yet ascertain character. Of existence could tell seeing cocoa-nut trees growing it. It evidently low. Of extent unable form opinion. "My fear shall find water it, case must search another," observed doctor. "You forget milk cocoa-nuts," said Desmond, laughing. "We soon exhaust that," answered doctor, gloomy tone. "But do not know yet shall find water," answered Desmond; "I already make land extending couple miles north south, higher first supposed, see even yet." "If volcanic agency work, may hope find water," observed doctor, brightening little; "but I confess I cannot see land." The doctor, however, near-sighted. The question next arose whether inhabitants, so, whether likely prove friendly. "I say white kidnappers colonies visited them, likely anything friendly, shall probably fight lives," said doctor. "But, dear sir, do not know whether inhabitants," said Desmond. "Let us look bright side things escaped lives, abundance provisions. Why make unhappy necessary?" The wind occasionally dropped, oars paddles put motion, raft continued course steadily towards land. Even wind blew freshest she moved slowly, long time appeared she would reach shore dark. As looked astern, however, found sunk wreck almost sight. The doctor fancied she must gone down, he could distinguish her. The wind, however, freshened, Jerry asserted raft going rate three knots hour. At length land clearly seen places, side island especially, rising considerable height ridges hillocks. "No fear now, doctor, finding water," observed Desmond. "Volcanic agency must work throw hills, I begin see low trees shrubs. It may turn fertile spot, though picturesque one, I grant." "If affords us rest feet, vegetable productions keep scurvy distance, ample supply water, shall reason thankful," said doctor, whose spirits rose he persuaded his worst anticipations would fulfilled. The sun getting low, would dark could reach shore. Desmond Jerry declared could see sign breakers, sun dipped beneath horizon his rays shone white sandy beach, promised afford easy landing-place. On one point, however, doctor's mind satisfied. "What island inhabited savages? And supplies food water, likely case," he observed. "We must try make friends them, or, friends, keep distance; depend upon civil enough see firearms," answered Desmond. "Inhabited? I am sure is," exclaimed Jerry, suddenly. "Look there! there is fellow dancing away top hillock. He sees us; chances score two black fellows like hidden away, upon us step shore." Desmond time saw savage, told Tom. "Well, one yet," said Tom; "perhaps, however, may prudent load couple muskets, though one sufficient, depend upon it, keep bay." As raft approached shore, gestures savage appeared become frantic, gloom evening soon rendered his form indistinct, although he could still seen sky. The breeze almost died away, paddles got out. The raft neared shore. There was, saw, little surf, sufficient endanger raft cargo. In minutes beach would reached. The savage disappeared, voice heard, evidently shouting them. "Bedad! savage Pat Casey!" exclaimed Tim, recognised his countryman's voice, and, raft touched beach, Pat rushed forward, grasped hands Jerry Tim, sprang overboard assist securing it. The rest party quickly followed, important lighten raft soon possible. "Where men?" asked doctor. "We thought lost soon left wreck." "Sure, entirely myself," answered Pat; "and I came shore I tell, except I am supposing I held bottom boat, morning I found high dry beach. I am mighty glad see all, welcome island." "Are savages?" asked doctor. "Barring myself, no, honour," answered Pat, laugh. "They would upon any, soul I set eyes since I came ashore." However, time talking, important land cargo. The whole party, aided Pat, immediately set performing task. Everything got shore without damage. The raft secured strongest ropes possessed trunk cocoa-nut tree, fortunately grew near. Pat collected wood fire, though he forgotten he possess means igniting it. But matches fortunately brought among things, bright blaze soon produced. By light, doctor's suggestion, tent formed sails raft spare canvas, large enough afford shelter whole party. Peter Pat been, mean time, busily engaged preparing supper, hands ready justice. "Dare, gentl'm," exclaimed Peter, he placed slices fried ham doctor midshipmen; "you get better dan dis de bes' hotel Boston. Per'aps tink de cook worth glass ob grog?" Tom took hint, divided couple bottles wine among party, assisted put good spirits. They sat round fire, yarns told songs sung, heads soon began nod, glad seek shelter tent. As island uninhabited, Tom consider necessary set watch; indeed, one party made attempt, probabilities he would unable keep his eyes open. CHAPTER FIVE. SEARCH FOR AND FIND THE BOAT--RETURN IN HER TO THE WRECK--FIND MORE STORES, AND BUILD A RAFT--CARRY IT TO THE SHORE, AND GO BACK TO BREAK UP THE WRECK FOR BUILDING A VESSEL--ONCE MORE GETTING BACK THEY FIND THE DOCTOR WORKING AT A STILL--ANOTHER TRIP--IT COMES ON TO BLOW HARD--REACH SHORE--THE STILL SUCCESSFUL--THE GALE INCREASES--ITS EFFECTS ON THE WRECK--MORE STORES SAVED--SEEDS FOUND AND SOWN--A FLAG-STAFF SET UP-- PLANS FOR THEIR PROPOSED VESSEL--ENGAGED IN SHOOTING AND FISHING-- DISCOVER A MARINE POULTRY-YARD--BILLY AND THE EGGS--SUCCESSFUL FISHING-- SEEDS SOWN. Tom, always first foot, roused his companions. "Do let fellow his sleep out," murmured Billy; "we got nothing do." "We have plenty do," answered Tom. "We have got look water, find build hut, ascertain food island produces, try go back wreck bring stores, put flag-staff, fifty things." "Well, I did not think that," said Billy, sitting up. "Dear me, dear me! are, another desert island; chances remaining born days." "Better bottom sea, crunched sharks," observed Desmond, "or cast shore among cannibals, would cooked eaten us first opportunity. It barren island either, cocoa-nut trees, may fruits roots. We shall probably also able catch plenty fish." "If could get hold fine fat turtle, would purpose," said Billy. "Pat makes capital turtle soup. I am glad he escaped." "I afraid turtle done laying eggs time," observed doctor. "They come shore purpose, likely catch otherwise, must give thoughts revelling turtle." While Peter prepared breakfast, Pat climbed one cocoa-nut trees, sent nuts enough afford party refreshing draught liquid. It could properly called milk, yet assumed white appearance, nut perfectly ripe. It welcome, notwithstanding. Though small cask water brought shore, Tom wisely wished husband spring discovered. About doctor doubtful, Pat, he questioned subject, stated he discovered signs water. "I wished search water first thing," observed Tom; "but whether found not, important ascertain whether boat washed beach, she repaired enable us return wreck." "Can show us came shore, Pat?" "Bedad, sir, I have wandering many times, I quite certain; it is belief she found anywhere, away northward, I did not see her end." "Then set without delay," said Tom; taking Pat, he Desmond, Jerry Bird, commenced search boat direction Pat mentioned. The sandy beach divided many places masses coral extending distance water, among boat might easily concealed. Had she, however, thrown them, she would, Tom feared, probability knocked pieces. The surprising thing Pat seen her. It appeared his account he partially recovered his senses, finding shore, he set confused state mind, without knowing he going, time must elapsed he came entirely himself. "Suppose recover boat, visit wreck?" asked Desmond. "We must build smaller raft large one, much easily manage; weather continue calm, appears strong current likely drive us away, may, I think, without much risk easily make trip back," answered Tom. "But carry cargo?" inquired Desmond. "We must form another raft board, materials serve building hut," answer. "Then think shall remain time island?" said Desmond. "Of course; may months years, may get days weeks. Had good carpenter among us, might built vessel wreck, she hold together long enough us bring good portion her planking timber ashore; I certain none us capable that, although stock carpenter's tools." "There nothing like trying," said Desmond. "I seen ships built; obtain timber, might manage time put one together large enough carry us Guam Sandwich Islands." "We hear doctor says. What think it, Bird?" "Well, sir, I helped rig many craft, cannot say I ever worked shipwright, though I ready try hand anything else, `where there is there is way.'" "What say, Pat?" asked Tom. "As that, Mr Rogers, man Prime Minister, he ought think fit anything; sooner live dissolute island life, I would undertake build ninety-gun ship, I materials." The answers two seamen made Tom think Desmond's proposal was, events, worth consideration. "Well, find get timber enough wreck, I do not see make attempt," he said, turning matter his mind. "I will undertake build vessel ten fifteen tons, carry us Sandwich Islands," observed Desmond, confidently. "I got idea head, though I cannot promise she much clipper, she shall keep afloat, beat windward, stand pretty heavy sea." Tom Desmond discussed matter walked along. Presently Pat, started ahead, cried out, "Arrah! she is, right, tight," he pointed little sandy bay, almost extreme northern end island. There lay boat beach. She narrowly missed swept round island, she would probability lost unless counter current, lee side, driven her back. She escaped also another danger, dashed pieces rugged ledge close she must passed. The party hurried her ascertain damage she received. The surf evidently turned her over, little water remained her. At first sight she appeared uninjured. "I afraid so," said Tom, he going round her, put his hand hole bows. "The water ran here; perhaps she would suffered she thus damaged. If she is stove nowhere else, shall able repair her." This apparently damage boat received. "I surprised she swamped many men her, heavy sea running unhappy men put off," observed Tom. "We shall bring tools materials here. And let us see oars cast shore." They hunted about, oars, much lighter boat, either swept round north end island thrown part shore. Having hauled boat up, returned towards camp. Tom Desmond anxious repair boat visit wreck night-fall, case weather change she go pieces. As walked along discussed best plan repairing boat. Desmond suggested first nail pieces well-greased canvas, fix two lengths staves one casks. "But where is grease come from? I am afraid none," observed Tom. "We have got piece bacon, would grease enough purpose," answered Desmond. Their conversation interrupted shout Jerry Bird, held oar he found floating close shore one ledges. This, three oars already possessed, one long paddles steer by, would enable shove soon could patch boat. The doctor's spirits rose considerably he heard boat discovered, he consented remain shore Tim Peter, rest party returned wreck--he undertaking search water. "You must alarmed come back to-night," said Tom; "for, weather promises fine, may better build large raft, tow ashore stores obtain." "Remember, Rogers, bring one tripods, smith's forge tools, piping; fail discover water, I may able construct still, may obtain much fresh water require." "A capital idea," exclaimed Tom. "I did not think that." "`Necessity mother invention,'" answered doctor. "I never worked smith, I know principles still constructed, I hope I shall able put one up; if, however, find water, may saved trouble, employ labour purposes." As would time board spare cooking, Tom supply food, sufficient couple days, put up, bottle water cocoa-nuts, case might unable get water board. Thus laden materials repairing boat, went back she lay, accompanied Billy. Tom begged doctor light fire night, case weather come bad might return sooner intended. Desmond's plan carried out. Bird brought oakum, forced seams chisel, party surveyed work, reason hope boat would events swim. They watched result, however, little anxiety, as, run her beach, she afloat. She leaked slightly, Desmond declared place she repaired, found getting distance shore could easily bale water made way in. Tom brought compass, believing he knew bearings wreck, he steered course would soon bring sight her. The sea calm he suppose possible she could gone pieces, pulled on, he looked eagerly her. At length he made dark object rising blue sea almost due west island. "There she is!" he exclaimed; "we shall board her hour." The crew gave way, less time mentioned alongside. She appeared exactly condition left her. The boat carefully secured, climbed her side. The first thing obtained cask fresh water, fortunate finding; got placed deck. It would take long describe various articles obtained. Among smith's forge, piping tripod, doctor especially asked for. For Jerry Pat dived hold. Others found spar-deck part ship, got without difficulty. Tom Gerald, came deck, frequently took glance around see weather looked, satisfied every appearance holding fine. They accordingly made minds remain night. Having collected stores raft intended build could carry, commenced forming one. The mizzen part mainmast still remained standing; Tom proposed forming shears trying hoist former; found impracticable, cut masts away, serve main beams raft. Several spars got up, began cutting away spar-deck. They worked dark, Pat cooked supper--the first food eaten since morning. "Now, shall want sleep," said Tom; "but though ship will not run away us, prudent keep watch case bad weather come on; although looks fine present, trust that. I will keep first watch; you, Desmond, take middle; Bird shall morning watch. We excuse Billy, possible he may fall asleep tumble overboard, events forget call us, Pat requires another night's rest his night bottom boat hard work he done to-day." Tom, reality, wish trust Pat entirely, thinking possible soon he would stow away go sleep. The deck cabin free water, party far comfortably would shore. The deck great inclination afford good walk, Tom managed keep awake holding weather bulwarks, moving backwards forwards, constantly looking windward change weather. Though, trouble taken, would sorry lose various things found board, would unwise risked remaining wreck wind get up. The sky, however, perfectly clear, stars shone brilliantly, undimmed slightest vapour, scarcely breath wind disturbed surface slumbering ocean. "We shall want breeze to-morrow carry us shore, though I hope remain calm present then," thought Tom. He frequently greatest difficulty keeping his eyes open, he succeeded. He calculated midnight he went below, finding time, roused Gerald. "Do let sleep overtake you, old fellow," he said. "I found hard matter keep eyes open." "Yes, mine shut four hours," said Desmond. "I will look ship, depend upon soon watch I will rouse Jerry." The middle watch passed away calmly first, Jerry, taking look round, declared his belief day would fine former. According Tom's orders, hands aroused daybreak, immediately set work raft, completed launched overboard knocked breakfast. Empty casks got it, masts set up. As wind fair, rig couple large lugs, answered every purpose. They next load raft; water perfectly smooth, hauled side, easily done, though lower many heavier articles tackle. Tom directed Desmond Jerry go ahead boat, Billy Pat remained board help raft. As day advanced, steady breeze arose, raft, heavy was, made great progress, helped boat, towards shore. As towards evening neared beach, saw companions anxiously waiting them. The doctor's face looked even longer usual. "What is matter?" asked Tom, he shook hands. "We found water," answered doctor; "and brought materials making still, doomed." "But I hope brought everything want, doctor," replied Tom. "Thank Heaven! lives may preserved," said doctor. "I almost afraid ask question." "We got even expected," said Desmond; "and weather hold fine, may hope, course two three trips, get wood enough proposed craft." There time talking, however. All hands set work unload raft; doctor, better spirits, hauling away might main, get heavy articles beach dark. Not everything already shore, two rafts taken pieces, dragged likewise. The weather continued fine Tom Desmond determined, hauling boat, go back wreck stores, bring away many rafts timber could obtain. The doctor said he must remain shore work still. For his assistants he chose Billy Blueblazes Peter black. Billy ingenious, but, doctor observed, "he could collect wood blow bellows." Billy first indignant told he thus employed, due reflection he came conclusion would easier work tearing planking wreck, pulling oar hot sun several hours day. The first thing done set forge. All hands turned daybreak, doctor able begin work boat party shoved off. It took two hours get wreck. They hard work them. First made thorough search remaining provisions, iron-work, canvas, ropes, blocks. These placed aft, ready lowering raft soon one could put together. Sailors naturally feel somewhat melancholy task break ship. It seems hope use gone, probably party trouble sentimental ideas subject then; thought best, way tear planking, secure much timber possible. They indeed cheered thoughts able build trim little craft battered hull, carry place whence could get back Old England. For hours laboured away sledge-hammers, crowbars, saws. The bowsprit first got out, remaining portions bulwarks wore cut away. They commenced upper deck, planks torn lowered overboard lashed alongside. "To mind, pretty strong gale would save us mighty deal trouble," observed Tim, he working away. "The say hours would work get many days." "Very likely, boy," observed Jerry; "but would timber go to? would come floating accord landing-place, I suspect would much use got there. Let us thankful calm weather, work away lasts." After hours' labour, sufficient quantity wood obtained form large raft. It much rougher description two former ones, still buoyant enough carry remaining stores. Among things brought kedge anchor hawser. They had, however, forgotten spars remaining serve masts yards; necessary, therefore, tow raft. By time ready, late would impossible reach shore dark, Tom omitted charge doctor keep fire might steer landing-place. "Well, never mind, begin voyage," he said, "and gets dark anchor raft return morning. Should bad weather come on, chances timber, events, washed shore, though may lose stores; matter much, although may compelled reduce dimensions craft." Tom Jerry took charge raft, contrived two large paddles propel it, Desmond rest went boat pulled ahead. More progress made expected, slight current set towards shore, performed half distance grew dark. The night also fine, Desmond compass boat taken bearings harbour, he able steer it. The doctor forgotten them. In short time, catching sight fire blazing brightly, knew must burning close beach, continued course. It was, however, past ten of the clock reached shore, found doctor his companions ready receive them. "You idle, I see; I," he exclaimed. "I made good progress still, I hope get working order early to-morrow." Tom hoped doctor would disappointed his expectations, examining water he found sufficient, rate consumed, last two three days more. He determined, therefore, place party allowance, case still succeed. "You need afraid that," observed doctor; "if obtain fresh water to-morrow evening, I undertake drink gallon salt water. Will satisfy you?" "I think so," answered Tom, laughing. "I doubt success; accident may happen, well safe side." Another trip made next day wreck, party able devote whole strength work breaking vessel, got larger quantity wood previous day, including several timbers, which, sawn through, would make ribs proposed vessel. As day drew on, weather gave signs changing. Tom intended remaining even later hour before, doctor promised keep fire blazing beach, voyage could performed well dark day-time. But, two of the clock wind began get up, ocean, hitherto shining like mirror rays sun, seen rippled wavelets, gradually increased size, dash water weather side wreck sounded louder louder. "We shall blowing strong night, Mr Desmond," observed Jerry; "and I thinking would prudent Mr Rogers order us shove off, make best way shore." Desmond reported Jerry said Tom, saw wisdom advice. The timber got forthwith fastened together. A spar serve mast, square sail, brought off, rigged voyage commenced. The wind increased sent raft along rapid rate, considering form weight, Tom, before, steering it. Sometimes, indeed, oars little work except assist guiding raft. At last Tom ordered cast end keep alongside, case he Jerry might washed away fast-rising seas occasionally swept almost raft, water knees. Gerald length advised Tom come boat let raft find way best could shore. "No, no," answered Tom; "as long I steer I will, try carry safely beach; strike coral rocks, timbers may injured service." As raft neared island, Jerry every took look astern. "There will not much ship left to-morrow morning, I hope good part her come shore, get lot safe beach shall timber enough building craft spare fire-wood." Though wind blew stronger stronger, Tom stuck raft, rewarded his perseverance carrying it, dark, safely beach. "Welcome back, young friends. I shall drink gallon salt water," exclaimed doctor, producing jug. "Just taste that." All party pronounced product still excellent, nothing drink since left wreck, glad obtain it. After taking hurried mouthfuls food set work drag materials raft, lest sea might carry night. The task accomplished, length lay tent, doctor rendered tenable otherwise would putting close paling weather side. Fortunately rain fell, wind, night advanced blew great force, found way crevices. In morning ocean covered tossing foam-crested waves, rolled broke continuous roar rocky shore. They soon evidence effect gale wreck. Fragments various sizes casks oil seen floating directions, larger portion drifting towards northern end island. Some came right bay, secured; others struck coral rocks, soon ground small pieces. Jerry proposed going along shore, accompanied Tim Pat, order pick whatever could find. They might save timber casks cases hold, which, water, unable get up. The rest party mean time commenced building hut. They first selected timber planking would use vessel. The discomfort endured previous night made anxious secure sufficient shelter rain come on, exposed situation could trust protection tent. The roof, however, intended form canvas, enough purpose, would answer better anything else could obtain. Peter prepared dinner party. "But want," observed doctor, looking pot; "we must economical use provisions." "Neber fear, massa," answered Peter; "dey come back good time. Dey smell dis de oder end ob de island." Peter right his conjectures. Just he serve stew, Jerry his companions made appearance. They reported hauled several good-sized pieces wreck, three casks oil, barrel flour, two beef pork. "Very good," observed doctor; "we shall run short provisions; I glad hear found case two containing lime-juice. We must look vegetables sort, may keep scurvy bay." "Shure, does not island grow taters?" asked Tim. "I am afraid not," answered doctor. "Thin must poor place, I will wish spend remainder days here," answered Tim, one his inimitable grimaces. "Though potatoes, may roots sort, yet examined cases brought cabin. If I recollect rightly, seeds sent board sailed, though fortunately opportunity making use them," observed doctor. A search instituted, box doctor spoke discovered; contained cabbage, lettuce, onion, carrot, turnip, several kinds seeds. "The onions, case, prove valuable, grown size vessel completed, carry sea us. They certain specific scurvy," said doctor. These remarks made officers men sat together breakfast. They good spirits, thankful well supplied everything could possibly require. Had doctor, however, different would condition! In day two would suffering horrors thirst, must ultimately perished miserably, could obtain much fresh water could require drinking cooking. "One thing, however, must remember, provisions time come end," observed Tom. "We must use perishable first keep best preserved voyage." "But shall able catch fish, need go short commons, I hope," said Billy. "You shall catch," said Desmond, laughing; "but hooks?" "Lashings, sir," answered Tim. "I found bag full carpenter's store-room, threw among things." The hooks lines soon discovered, present much work done allow one go fishing. The hut soon finished. It placed back wind. There plenty spars, which, without cutting, served rafters, stretched couple sails, lashed securely down, ordinary hurricane could blown away. In front, sheltered wind, established two fires, one cooking, still. To give sufficient supply water, necessary keep latter always alight. Gerald, first propose building vessel, anxious lay keel. "I eager are, I think may possibly taken passing vessel," said Tom. "As soon gale must set flag-staff, good tall one too, may seen long distance, vessel likely, intentionally, come near reefs." "But we have got American flag, I like taken Yankee," exclaimed Desmond, without considering he saying. "Young gentleman," exclaimed doctor, bristling up, "you might sail less honoured flag, fight too, let tell you! It one made respected every sea, ever found side freedom justice." "I beg pardon, doctor," answered Desmond. "If I English midshipman, I perfectly ready become American commodore, I fully believe navy, size, superior nation sun." "Well, well, young friend, us national prejudices, right should, provided bring prominently forward. You may think England tallest country world, I may consider United States taller still, well measuring heights, may come peg two." "Come," said Tom, "let us set flag-staff hoist stars stripes, one Uncle Sam's ships come by, hand island free gift exchange passage part world she may bound." It take long form flag-staff fit rigging: chief difficulty dig hole sufficient depth coral rock step it. This, however, last done, wind fallen, evening flag-staff fixed, hearty cheer, led doctor, stars stripes run top. The flag was, however, hauled sunset. Tom also quantity wood collected piled highest point near flag-staff, ship time evening seen offing, might lit attract attention. One brass guns beer brought shore placed carriage near flag-staff, might fired necessary. "We good day's work, I propose to-morrow lay keel vessel," said Desmond. To Tom readily agreed; two midshipmen, doctor, sat late hour, discussing subject drawing plans proposed craft. They couple adzes, three axes, two augers, five party could engaged building; indeed, would dangerous entrusted tools. Billy certainty would cut his toes, neither Tom Desmond accustomed use, although knew necessary do. To form keel simple work enough, shape timbers properly required greatest skill. Here doctor superior rest. He chose level part sand, he drew form timbers, rest party executed plans he gave them. As timbers two, saw-pit dug, Billy doomed work under-sawyer, task Desmond assured he performed perfection. By end first day keel put stem stern-post set up. "I work, must neglected, friends," said doctor, party collected supper. "We must look fresh provisions. Perhaps, Rogers, Desmond take guns shoot birds to-morrow; large numbers, I see, end island. They may prove wholesome, palatable food. I do not know best fishermen among you, I would advise two go every day boat fishing, may trespass salt provisions." "Pat Casey skilful fisherman among us, he another party suggest, doctor," said Tom. Tom Desmond accordingly, wished explore end island hitherto visited, set guns next morning. They gone far found among numbers birds, large portion made nests ground. It appeared reason selected southern end island. Most tame refused move, attacked midshipmen's legs beaks. Among gannets, sooty terns, tropical birds large numbers. The gannets sat eggs croaking hoarsely, moving even midshipmen attempted catch them. There also frigate birds built nests, lower trees, sticks roughly put together. They sat time watching trespassers domain, spreading wings flew off, inflating blood-red bladders, size largest cocoa-nuts, aid ascent though air. "We need expend powder shot fellows," observed Desmond; "and wring necks many want use, take eggs." "Let us ascertain long eggs sat upon, may trouble carrying nothing," answered Tom. They went forward, expecting get beyond region birds, instead, nests grew thicker thicker; indeed, midshipmen's progress almost stopped times, dodge skip avoid attacks made legs. "We need fear starving, although might time get tired poultry," said Desmond. At last came lower part island, sea occasionally washed. It avoided wise birds, still inhabitants. Whole armies soldier-crabs marching every direction shells backs, well common crabs watch lizard snake-like creatures ventured among them. Sometimes, big crab got hold one these, attention occupied carrying prey, frigate bird would pounce seize it, carrying captive nest. The midshipmen amused could tell time passed, hunger hot sun reminded time dinner would ready; passing "farm-yard," Desmond called it, secured many birds could carry also filled pockets freshest-looking eggs could find. Desmond, giving wink Tom, put among couple nest mother bird fought stoutly, certainly look fresh. "I almost hear croak," he said, placing egg his ear. "I intend _bonne-bouche_ Billy. We will not show others, make suppose especially favour bringing these, knowing fond he eggs." Gerald kept his intention. As nobody hut got back, hid away eggs exception two, Desmond kindly selected his messmate. Peter engaged cooking, his stew ready, he shouted announce fact. They hurried in, hungry eager begin work. Tom Desmond showed birds, described numbers met with. "Did bring eggs?" asked doctor; "they cooked once, likely prove better flavoured birds themselves." "Yes," said Desmond, "we brought many pockets hold, hand Peter directly, I want give Billy first, he especially fond eggs; he value he thinks nobody else them." Saying this, he handed Peter put ashes. "There," he exclaimed Billy appeared, "we know like eggs, brought couple, whenever go try find more." Billy watched eggs eagerly, Peter declared sufficiently cooked. "Doctor, will not one?" asked Billy, politely, Peter handed him. "No, thank you," answered doctor; "I content stew." Billy reluctantly felt called upon offer egg Tom Desmond; declined. "Then I suppose I must eat myself," said Billy, beginning break she will. He went operation performed, he clapped end his mouth. "Horrible!" he exclaimed, spitting contents out. "If I have not bitten bird's head!" "Try other, Billy," said Desmond; "that may mature." Billy, suspecting trick, commenced second egg, Desmond, running hut, produced rest brought, Peter slipped ashes. Billy looked several times second egg; he going put his mouth he bethought his knife. No sooner he cut it, he threw away, exclaiming-- "I believe, Desmond, brought purpose; almost spoilt appetite." "Then I done anything else ever accomplished," answered Desmond, laughing. "Never mind, Billy, shall freshest eggs cooking ashes regain appetite." "I think I shall able that, I think I take stew mean time." The rest eggs fresh, doctor advised collect supply once, birds sat long them, probably greater number time done laying. In afternoon Pat went boat short distance, less hour caught fish party could consume. The doctor busily employed hitherto, he, set man work, started time search vegetables. He came back bag filled small green leaves. "I found nothing except cocoa-nuts palatable, garden seeds come prove greater value roots likely discovered. I aware found low latitude. It species sorrel; seems placed Providence especial use seamen, efficacious preventing scurvy. All sea officers acquainted it, grows nearly every uninhabited island." As soon became dark work vessel, hands turned purpose breaking plot forming proposed garden close hut, seeds might put without delay. They went work following morning daybreak, short time sufficient space cleared broken intended object; animals, necessary run sticks ground mark spot. "Now," said doctor, "if Providence wills it, may live next ten twenty years, fail build craft venture sea." "I afraid that," said Desmond, "and I hope time crop vegetables up, may craft afloat, ready sail Sandwich Islands, Hong-kong." CHAPTER SIX. PROGRESS MADE IN BUILDING A VESSEL--TOOLS BREAK--SIGNAL KEPT FLYING--A SAIL SEEN--THE FLYING BEACON--A NIGHT OF SUSPENSE--SIGNAL GUNS FIRED--AN ANSWERING GUN HEARD--A MAN-OF-WAR STEAMER IN SIGHT--A BOAT COMES ON SHORE--TOM AND HIS FRIENDS GET ON BOARD HMS BELLONA, CAPTAIN MURRAY, AND FIND CAPTAIN ROGERS--FALL IN WITH A DISMASTED JUNK--JONATHAN JULL AND HIS WIFE--SUSPICIOUS APPEARANCE OF JUNK--JULL AND HIS WIFE TAKEN ON BOARD THE BELLONA--THE JUNK BLOWS UP AND FOUNDERS--THE BELLONA PROCEEDS ON HER COURSE--PASS A REEF--A WRECK SEEN--VISITED--SUPPOSED TO BE THE DRAGON--NO ONE FOUND ON SHORE--BELLONA REACHES HONG-KONG--JULL DISAPPEARS--CAPTAIN ROGERS ASSUMES COMMAND OF THE EMPRESS. The midshipmen doctor somewhat sanguine regard rapidity proposed craft could built. They taken account damage tools would receive unskilful hands. They constantly striking bolts nails adzes hatchets, blunting edges. One two augers broke, reason fear second injured. Tim Nolan cut badly, unable work several days. Two party obliged go fish hours, fish caught one day unfit food next. Several ribs, unscientifically shaped, taken reformed. Two three split render useless. Tom doctor, architects, exerted wits, practical skill none, often regretted want training. "If every sea officer serve months dockyard, he would gain knowledge would useful circumstances, events," observed doctor. Still, dint sawing chopping, got dozen ribs cut fixed places. They improved too, and, Gerald declared, "would got like house fire," one adzes totally disabled constant grinding required restore edge. An axe also broke, three tools executing rougher work, beside large chisels; found smoothing slow process. The doctor constantly charging Jerry Tim careful using took. He especially anxious auger. "If goes shall brought pretty well standstill, I doubt I replace it," he remarked. At last he determined let his hands, bore bolt holes himself. One day, however, he working away, crack heard, auger refused advance. He drew out; tip broken. Examining look dismay, he sighed deeply, "Our shipbuilding must come end, I fear, unless replace simple instrument." "We try, however, see accomplish forge," said Tom. "You forget steel," observed doctor; "it difficult soften afterwards restore temper." "We try," repeated Tom; "a day two will not make much difference, go parts vessel mean time." Tom disappointed; repeated experiments he doctor succeeded putting head auger, success encouraged repair first broken; found neither worked well done before. At last, however, broke. Neither Tom Desmond made stuff could easily defeated. "We must try again," said Tom. "I heard missionary South Seas built vessel entirely himself, without single white man help him, course three four months. He begin without tools, ship's anchor chain cable, trees still growing forest. He set forge, manufactured tools, saws, axes, taught natives use them. They cut trees, sawed up. He made ropes fibre, sails matting; necessary iron-work, little whole craft, formed remainder old anchor; yet vessel performed long voyages several years visited numerous islands Pacific. Surely one man accomplish work, ought ashamed if, materials ready hands, cannot build craft want." "Yes, friend; missionary speak of--the late lamented Williams, murdered far west us--was practical mechanic. He studied blacksmith's work he left England, must possessed large amount mechanical talent, none us boast of." Encouraged Tom, doctor recovered his spirits, shipbuilding progressed fair speed. The main beams fixed up, skeleton almost complete, yet plank fixed on. This, however, appeared comparatively easy work, one entertained doubt success undertaking. Regular discipline maintained time. At daybreak Tom Desmond visited hill, hoisted flag, took look round. In evening, flag hauled down, generally two went up, case distant sail might escape observation one, discovered other, intended light beacon fire, hopes attracting her attention. Billy Blueblazes, got sharp pair eyes, whatever might said his wits, one evening accompanied Desmond. They stood minutes scanning horizon, speck visible blue sky except there, sea-fowl winging way towards shore. "It would save us great deal trouble vessel would come," observed Billy. "If could build steamer would well; may becalmed days together, I like go endure boat--mashed yams oil. Bah! I have got taste mouth yet." "You have put good many things it, though, since then," said Desmond. "For part, done much, I almost disappointed taken craft finished. I exactly wish go round Cape Horn her, I would go anywhere else. I hope Rogers decide sailing Hong-kong." "At events, I wish she finished, I tired sawing work," cried Billy. "Well, Billy, haul flag, appears nothing sight; go, swarm flag-staff, take another look round; horizon remarkably clear, might see ship's royals, even though it." Billy Desmond asked do. Presently he took his cap, waving it, shouted-- "A sail! sail! eastward!" "Are certain it?" asked Desmond. "As sure I hand," answered Billy. "A ship's royals, I certain it. I think, too, she standing way." "Come down, then," said Desmond, "and I will look glass." He telescope slung his back. He swarmed he reached head shrouds, when, securing himself, he brought his glass bear direction Billy pointed. "You right, Billy," he exclaimed, taking steady look it. "I make fore, main, head mizzen royals. A large ship too, and, say, she standing way, wind eastward. She pass far either." Having taken another steady glance glass, Desmond descended; indeed, thickening gloom time almost shut sail sight. He Billy hurried back camp. "Hurrah! hurrah!" shouted one breath. "There ship coming take us off!" The rest party incredulous Desmond fully described appearance sail. "And let us get beacon fire alight," he exclaimed. "No great hurry that," said Tom. "It could seen time, carry supply fuel keep burning night. There may sail, cannot positive she standing way, she she may alter her course, carry her distance us," said doctor. "But I positive she standing way," exclaimed Desmond. "She may alter her course, fire seen." At doctor's suggestion, one oil barrels rolled contents might increase flame. Every one eager light beacon fire; even Billy forgot propose first eat supper. The doctor remarked ship drawing near send long spar, placed horizon tally burning mass end it, greater height might seen fire ground. His plan adopted; signal halyards strong enough purpose, means line end could hoisted without risk burning shrouds. He quickly manufactured fusee, mass would blaze yard fixed. The material fired composed oakum mixed gunpowder, canvas saturated oil, bundles shavings kept together pieces iron hoop. Tom gave word hoist away, "the flying beacon," Desmond called it, soon afterwards burst forth bright flame. The fire lighted, blazed cast lurid glare whole island, ribs vessel, hut tall cocoa-nut trees, lower shrubs. At instant loud screams heard--the birds, startled unusual appearance, mounted air, numbers flying towards fire, party hill use sticks keep off, darted there, blinded light. More fuel added, soon doctor's flying beacon burnt out, another description hoisted. "Well, do not see fire must asleep board stranger," said Desmond. "No fear that," remarked doctor; "in seas, reefs every side, depend upon bright look-out kept, ship could get across safety." "If she stood on, supposed she steering, she must time near enough hear gun," said Tom. "Bring powder wadding, Bird." Jerry eagerly hastened obey order. The gun fired every five minutes, although likely, sound travel wind, would heard time board ship. Most party forgotten supper, Billy exclaimed: "If I do not get provender, I shall collapse." As rest acknowledged much state, Peter Pat sent bring supply food. "Let plenty," said Billy; "we need short commons now, I hope!" The supper discussed light fire. Tom mean time could refrain looking answering signal. Hours went by, remained dark round island. As sleeping, would closed eyes even gone back hut. Tom kept his watch his hand time firing. The gun discharged silent, when, he give order fire, came breeze boom heavy gun. "No doubt sort piece comes from, sir," exclaimed Jerry. "The craft away man-of-war, I am sailor." "I think too," cried Tom; "they must noticed signals, I do not think ship pass without sending shore." "We might go her boat," said Jerry. "We difficulty finding her night, shall wise remain morning," answered Tom; "the wind light she probably still long way off, I could see flash her gun." Notwithstanding belief discovered, party island still kept beacon fire blazing, fired gun intervals. At length, pretty well tired out, hands turned exception two, remained keep fire discharge gun every ten minutes. Tom awoke dawn day hurried join Desmond, keeping morning watch. "Where she?" he exclaimed eagerly. "That I tell," answered Desmond. "I expected see her close to, boat come shore time." "The mist hides her us; see sweeps water northward. As sun rises depend upon shall see her," observed Tom. Still Desmond doubt; mist light he hitherto observed it, his eyes dazzled glare fire, still burning. Tom ran flag, might seen moment mist disperse. In short time joined rest party, various tones expressed disappointment seeing stranger. Presently sun rose, seconds veil lifted, disclosing large ship, her bulwarks rising horizon. "She man-of-war steamer," said Tom, first take look her telescope. "She is English too, she is hoisted her ensign. There smoke coming her funnel; she is getting steam. Hurrah! shall soon her here." The excitement became general greater ever. Tom Desmond, however, two party witnessed approach British man-of-war unmitigated satisfaction. The men, plenty food, hurry go back routine duty. The doctor Peter would among strangers, besides former, feeling assured vessel would time completed, anxious perform voyage craft constructed his superintendence. "The bother is, I shall keep tiresome watch," murmured Billy. However, he express openly his messmates subject. The frigate came slowly lead going look-outs frigate, although she might carry six eight guns. At length she got within mile island, screw stopped boat lowered. There one landing-place lee side, close hill flag-staff erected. Tom, securing four handkerchiefs end spar, hastened guide boat in. On she came, pulled six strong arms, lieutenant midshipman stern sheets. Tom, Desmond, Billy stood ready receive strangers. The boat quickly run beach, officers stepped shore. The lieutenant, observing three midshipmen's tattered uniforms, advanced towards them, inquired he shook hands, "Has American man-of-war cast away here?" "No, sir; American whaler wrecked weeks ago." "Then you, came here?" asked lieutenant. Tom words narrated adventures, asked, "And ship, sir?" "The _Bellona_, Captain Murray--" "What! Captain Alick Murray?" exclaimed Tom. "I served him. He brother Jack's greatest friend." "Are Captain Rogers's brother? That extraordinary," exclaimed lieutenant, "for he passenger us, going command _Empress_ China seas." "My brother Jack board! That good news." Tom honours, introduced lieutenant Dr Locock. "Of course Captain Murray happy receive board, survivors whaler's crew," said lieutenant. "I much obliged you; one, I shall glad embrace opportunity visiting China," answered doctor. The lieutenant received orders return soon possible, Tom begged come see vessel commenced building; though he made his mind try get Jack come shore also, he ambitious show handiwork him. "You deserve great credit attempt," said lieutenant, he examined structure; "but I congratulate escaping necessity making voyage her, she touched rock, probable she would gone pieces." After remark Tom felt less anxiety exhibit vessel his brother Jack. The lieutenant repeated his orders return immediately. The doctor merely requested he might allowed take his medicine case, instruments, clothes. "I shall happy let many things boat carry," said lieutenant; "but captain hurry continue voyage, he may unwilling send ashore articles." The boat soon loaded doctor's property, nautical instruments, clothing men appropriated, rapidly made her way towards _Bellona_. The doctor written note, he left hut, stating name vessel wrecked island, circumstances he survivor crew, party English officers men, quitted it. By his special request stars stripes left flying. As midshipmen followed lieutenant side, saw two captains standing quarter-deck, even Jack recognise his brother. Tom, lifting remnant his cap, went aft, putting his hand exclaimed-- "What, do not know me, Jack?" Captain Rogers looked seconds, wringing his hand said, "How come plight, dear fellow?" Tom course explained happened, Gerald Billy telling story Captain Murray. Doctor Locock course well taken care surgeon, invited ward-room. Tom good deal hear family matters. Desmond Billy Blueblazes soon made home young gentlemen ship, men equally cared forward. Captain Murray think worth send shore small part whaler's cargo saved, he promised give information first American man-of-war he might fall with, she might go thought worth while. The account midshipmen gave _Dragon_ caused considerable anxiety. When Captain Murray heard her machinery order, he felt satisfied she gone Hong-kong, she would certainly detained time, she would even yet able get back Bonins. "Perhaps," observed Tom, "Commander Rawson fancies lost, he likely come look us." The wind continuing light, _Bellona_ steered on, soon leaving coral island far astern. Shortly got board, Gerald asked Tom try learn his brother reasons his uncle sent home. "One was, I conclude, he expected get command himself, he anxious his nephew him," answered Jack. "Another consequence death several persons, young Desmond heir-at-law handsome estate title. His uncle thought better near hand, instead knocking far away home. There likely trial sort, friend Adair sanguine success. It may several years, however, matter settled, depends upon life present possessor, who, although somewhat old, hale hearty. But he may possibly break his neck, go world suddenly means, well Desmond spot claim his rights. I do not know whether Adair intended let his nephew know his arrival, told confidence, I may mention you. However, use discretion say friend--only let sanguine; may perhaps make take care himself, hitherto I suspect he apt do." Tom promised discreet he said Gerald, disappoint he fail success. Towards evening day _Bellona_ left coral island, shout heard look-out mast-head, "A rock starboard bow!" An officer, however, going aloft his glass, pronounced dismasted vessel. The frigate accordingly headed towards her, nearer approach, her peculiar build, she seen undoubtedly Chinese Japanese craft. It first supposed one board, steamer neared, flag waved part stranger. The ship's way accordingly stopped, boat lowered. Captain Rogers volunteering examine her, Tom accompanied him. As approached saw she must encountered bad weather, she lost her masts, she boats, considerable portion her upper works carried away, her sides weather-worn appearance, she long time knocking sea. On getting deck, one person seen, who, though dressed Chinese, European features. "I thankful fallen us, gentlemen," he said, good English, "for I do not know would otherwise become craft us." "Of us! Is one besides board?" asked Jack. "Yes, I wife me--we passengers board; junk blown coast lost her masts, crew deserted boat, leaving us fate." "Your wife! Where she?" asked Jack. "She below, sir," answer; "but she foreigner, young, timid, afraid come deck." "What you?--an Englishman?" inquired Jack. "Well, that, I American, though I seas long I cannot say I belong nation. Still, I forgotten native tongue. I grateful would take us tow, supply spars canvas, I might find way back." "That able do, I suspect, craft knocked she is, probably leaking little, even assistance wife," answered Jack. "As taking tow, question--we drag bows her; bring wife property possess board, I answer captain give passage Hong-kong place may touch desire leave ship. You seaman, I presume, undertaking sail back junk. What name, may I ask?" said Jack. "Jonathan Jull, service." "That name Yankee smack it, certainly," observed Jack. "Well, Mr Jull, I will overhaul craft, report her condition captain. He may possibly think fit take her tow, I make promises subject. In mean time prepare wife accompanying board." While Jonathan Jull went one cabins, Jack Tom, two men come board, went round junk. She considerable amount cargo board, somewhat miscellaneous character. Jack ordered well sounded. Tom one men performed operation, reported three feet hold, large amount water flat-bottomed craft. They long continued search Tom exclaimed-- "Look here; suspicious-looking marks. I already observed others. They evidently caused bullets. See, several places pieces wood chipped off, bullet sticking planking." "What think this, sir?" asked one men, pointing dark splashes deck side vessel. "That is blood; doubt it. I suspect foul work board," observed Jack. "I wonder whether Mr Jull account circumstance." "He, events, give his version matter," remarked Tom. On search signs violence discovered. Jack began suspect man's account deserted crew true one. He resolved, however, questioning him, take board _Bellona_, let Captain Murray decide do. "It appears unless several hands placed board keep vessel clear water, she must sink day two towed ship; certainly Mr Jull, experienced seaman he may be, even aid his wife, cannot, even craft supplied masts sails, find his way back China. He far likely run coral reef, purposely cast his vessel away one many islands seas, take his abode there." One thing certain, something suspicions man. Captain Rogers Tom made way main cabin, surprise see remarkably handsome young female bending chest, she engaged packing various articles Jonathan Jull, he called himself, standing by, handing her. Her complexion countenance, well her costume, showed her oriental, probably Malay, though her features refined Malays general. She rose she saw strangers enter cabin, unconsciously stood her arms crossed her bosom, gazing her large lustrous eyes, expressed terror satisfaction. "I see preparing quit vessel, Mr Jull," said Jack. "I must beg make haste stow chest, cannot remain much longer board. Indeed, her condition, impossible say she may go down." The man, without first answering, turned Malay girl, spoke words her her language, she knelt continued packing chest. There several cases man handed quickly girl, things chiefly articles clothing, two three jewel-hilted daggers, short sword, brace long-barrelled, beautifully mounted pistols. He apparently desirous allow English officers see contents his chest. As soon filled, locked it, he produced stout rope lashed seamanlike manner. "Now, sir, wife I ready," he said, throwing cloak girl's head, she could conceal her features. "If people lend hand get chest boat, I shall obliged," he continued. "As say, sir, craft seaworthy, since I made I neglected keep pump going. I compelled work several hours every day, leak would soon gained me." The man he spoke seemed perfectly cool collected, unwilling go board ship war. The chest, somewhat heavy, lowered boat, aid tackle owner produced. He his wife followed, taking seats stern sheets. As boat pulled away junk Jack observed she sunk already much lower water he went board, seemed settling astern. "That craft sprung fresh leak since saw her first," observed one crew, remained boat looking stranger. "I heard curious noise alongside, water rushing counter. We let know had not come side chest." These words spoken loud enough heard aft. Tom fancied he detected peculiar expression pass Jull's countenance, man immediately resumed his unconcerned look, spoke his wife endeavouring quiet her apparent alarm. The chest hoisted board, two persons taken junk allowed seat it, Jack made report Murray his visit junk. "Her cargo," he observed, "appears considerable value, would pity lose it." "We might get valuable portion her, must spend time it," remarked Murray. "From account, even take her tow, she likely keep water. We afterwards examine suspicious gentleman his wife, although I doubt whether shall get much them." "We likely get much junk either," said Jack, pointing her. "Look there!" As he spoke junk, towards frigate steering, seen lift her bows, immediately afterwards loud report heard; her stern decks blown fragments, seconds she disappeared beneath surface. "Our friend intention make examination craft," observed Jack. "Depend upon it, he taken effectual measures prevent us he secured his chest valuable property board." "We proof he instrumental her destruction, though circumstances suspicious," said Murray. "He course tell us he thinks fit her sudden foundering explosion board, prevented making examination signs conflict, suppose must taken place. We will, however, try get information man." A fragments wood floating surface remained junk, frigate, put her proper course, passed spot she lately floated. Notwithstanding suspicions entertained Mr Jull, Captain Murray wishing treat man's wife consideration, ordered screen put main-deck, she might private chest her eye. He sent Mr Jull come cabin, he, Jack first lieutenant, seated. Jonathan Jull persisted story he given Jack, stating he commanded opium clipper, cast away; he simply taken passage his wife board junk go Shanghai, he expected find employment. He glibly announced name his craft, _Swallow_, well names his officers, running his crew he stopped. "That necessary present," observed Captain Murray. But Mr Jull seemed anxious suspicion resting him. He next mentioned her tonnage armament, indeed everything her. "All good," said Captain Murray; "but account signs violence observed board junk--the stains blood, chipped beams, bullets sticking bulkheads?" Captain Jull, he announced himself, looked much astonished. "You observed, sir, I failed discover," he answered, "and I simply cannot account marks. If violence occurred, must taken place I went board junk. The crew appeared perfectly orderly, vessel dismasted, found her drifting away shore, take boats. For reason, I cannot account, refused allow wife accompany them." "Very well, Mr Jull; account junk sinking soon left her, explosion?" "She leaking much indeed, probably butt suddenly gave way," answered Captain Jull. "In regard explosion, wife lit fire stove aft, I suppose cask gunpowder must inadvertently left neighbourhood. But merely conjecture. She herself tell she lit fire." It clear naval officers would get information Captain Jull he unwilling give them. Although several suspicious circumstances him, Captain Murray feel justified making prisoner, he therefore allowed remain his wife. Tom Gerald made happy board new shipmates, Billy always liked wherever he went, never humour slightest objection laughed at, besides he store amusing anecdotes, able spin good yarn, sing merry song. Tom plenty talk his brother Jack, course time gave news home. Captain Rogers unwilling leave his wife, command ship offered him, he felt bound refuse. It cost Murray also little leave _Stella_. "We shall his magnificent little boy come sea long," said Jack. "How old makes one! It seems yesterday since I midshipman like you, Tom, I scarcely fancy even post-captain." "I hope I shall midshipman long," said Tom, "and Desmond Gordon get promoted." "There is little doubt that," said Jack, "if anything China, I fully expect something, government sending troops ships. The Chinese self-conceited give without sound thrashing. By-the-by, told Desmond anything his prospects?" "No; I thought might upset him," answered Tom. "I merely hinted heard his uncle possibility his obtaining fortune, uncertainty, he cross question much, I got without committing myself." Jack commended Tom's discretion. "It would better indeed he hear whole matter his uncle, probably sent China, shall meet long," observed Jack. The ship run couple days, weather continuing calm fine, though favourable breeze would acceptable save coal. About noon land sighted starboard bow. The master stated Island Dolores, appropriately called, consists small patch land rising amid collection coral reefs, would prove destruction unfortunate vessel driven them. The _Bellona_ passed along southern edge group, glasses several her officers turned towards land ascertain appearance, when, leaving starboard quarter, look-out aloft hailed deck say appeared wreck outer reef western side. The master second lieutenant, going aloft, convinced case, ship accordingly headed direction half speed, bright look-out kept dangers might lie distance reef water. As soon ship arrived abreast wreck, two boats lowered, sent second lieutenant master examine ascertain she was, and, possible, become her crew. Captain Rogers Tom went first-mentioned officer, Desmond master. As appeared channel leading island, Captain Murray directed party boats, persons found board, make way shore see whether people lately. The perfect calmness sea enabled boats get close up. As got near, saw her shattered condition likely one remaining board. When almost her, Jack exclaimed-- "She steamer, I see her machinery water, man-of-war too, I much fear she _Dragon_." "I afraid she is," said Tom. "That shall soon learn, however, get board, I know every inch her, knocked she is, I recognise something other, would put matter beyond doubt." The ship lay broadside reef. The stern completely knocked away, nearly entire part lower side, fore part suffered less, although bulwarks swept off, bowsprit gone. Indeed, she greatly resembled skeleton vast animal, head attached. There little footing anywhere, Tom Desmond, getting rocks, scrambled up. "Yes, old craft; doubt it," said Tom, made survey possible. "I sure it," answered Desmond. "If Bird Nolan come us, would known part ship even better do." They joined Captain Rogers, perfectly satisfied right. For seconds he stood contemplating sad remains gallant vessel he commanded. What his thoughts may imagined. Whether he heaved sigh known, Jack Rogers addicted sentimental. "We must ascertain whether poor fellows escaped," he exclaimed, leading way boat. "We carry Captain Murray's directions, visit island." The boats accordingly steered shore. It required careful look-out keep right channel, rocks, appeared directions water, might avoided. The shore reached last, one seen, though fragments wreck found scattered fixed crevices rocks. Here pieces casks, cases, cabin furniture, shattered impossible recognise them. The whole island searched, huts put up. No remains fires seen--indeed, signs one landed; even skeleton discovered. "They must lost, I fear," said Jack. "We easily conceive, fierce gale blowing, fearful surf would dashing rocks. Not boat could live it." The officers opinion every one board must lost. "Poor Archie!" said Tom Desmond; "there is one us gone, then. I wish he come boat, instead accompanying surveying expedition. Captain Murray sorry he hears it." As time consequence, object searching further, boats put returned ship. Captain Murray, deeply regretting loss _Dragon_, her officers, crew, especially grieved believe his young cousin, he taken deep interest, perished also. Both officers men, however, soon got sorrow ship-mates friends. They knew well might fate day, though, natural human beings, hoped escape die beds good old age, fighting days gallant deeds done. The _Bellona_ continued her course, passing Bashee Channel south Formosa, she clear run Hong-kong. At length lofty heights extended east west along entire length island came sight, _Bellona_ steered Sulphur Channel, lies larger island little island known Green Island. Steering channel, she entered harbour Victoria, assumed completely land-locked appearance, shut one side Kowloon Peninsula point jutting main land, former mile town Victoria. The island Hong-kong irregular shape, nine miles long three broad. Besides centre ridge series high lands either side it. The Western end rises height 1825 feet; Victoria Peak, foot stands town Victoria, creeping height beach. There several harbours--Ly-tum southern side, another west known Wong-ma-kok. On western side neck peninsula forms latter harbour military station Stanley, barracks erected, supposed would prove healthy position exposed south-west monsoon. The _Bellona_ steamed anchorage near Victoria. Among ships harbour _Empress_, Jack Rogers destined command. There several vacancies, Tom, Desmond, Billy Blueblazes accompanied her captain, intended get appointed her. Bird, Nolan, Casey also entered her books, Peter, well treated board _Bellona_, expressed his wish also join; Jack, Tom's recommendation, took his steward. Dr Locock, expressing his gratitude kindness he received, went shore, intending remain he could join American ship, either man-of-war merchantman. No sooner anchor dropped ship surrounded Chinese boats sorts provisions. Murray forgotten Captain Jull his wife. Before Captain Rogers left ship, he sent Tom summon man, intending question ascertain he going. Tom short time returned saying Jull his wife, chest, disappeared, one could tell become them, he must managed, officers men busily engaged, slip his chest port native boat alongside. No one had, however, seen him; his Chinese dress cloak his wife wore would prevented confusion observed. "There something altogether right fellow, depend upon it," said Jack. "He good reason wishing junk brought harbour, he would taken good care destroy her even her tow. We might brought trial her loss, possibly he might recognised." On mentioning subject afterwards shore, Murray learned large fleet piratical junks said commanded Englishman, little known them, except depredations committed Chinese merchant shipping, occasionally nations, although hitherto avoided risk interfering English vessels. The first inquiry Murray Rogers made, coming shore, _Dragon_; neither she her crew heard of, fears she vessel discovered reef confirmed. The _Empress_ time coast, members midshipmen's berth full seen ready impart information Tom Desmond, heard little nothing taken place. They found several old acquaintances board, among Charley Roy, met frequently Black Sea. Charley could talk, loth make use his talents. "You fellows want know done expect here," he began, first day board. "The Chinese, opinion, obstinate fellows world; besides beat others cunning deceit--at events, diplomatists do. They wonderful opinion themselves, do not know beaten; Lord Elgin found out. You, course, heard thrashing gave Celestials Bogue Forts, Canton, Pekin, dozens places, expedition hundreds miles big river, Yang-tse-kiang, till supposed brought order, still clever us, shall hear. You may heard Lord Elgin desirous going right Pekin exchange necessary ratifications lately formed treaty, squadron gun-boats sent escort him. As soon arrived Peiho, admiral sent officer announce approach British ambassador, Chinese commander refused permission land. Of course showed meant fighting." "Before commenced operations, however, reconnoissance made ascertain obstructions way. In first place found forts, destroyed, replaced earthworks, mounting large number guns, two forts higher left bank placed rake vessels might advance abreast forts right, forts united raised causeways. Right across river also end stakes booms, iron, several tons weight, forked rip vessel striking them. There also boom composed three stout cables, one hemp two iron chain, hundred yards two great rafts timber, stretching one bank, passage left scarcely sufficient width allow even gun-boat pass through. In front line forts ditches wide spaces soft mud, would scarcely possible storming parties pass. The Chinese declared arrangements simply made prevent smuggling, would immediately removed. "Another day passed, steps taken Celestials promised, admiral sent word say obstructions removed he take upon force. Having waited three days, he resolved bombard fort left. As shot would fallen town Taku, admiral sent officer advise inhabitants provide safety leaving place. "They, however, replied receive orders foreigners, touched barriers batteries would open fire upon us. Of course became necessary attack forts. Three larger ships nine gun-boats sent two divisions attack, first place, Taku forts right bank, one gun-boats directed pull stakes afford passage rest squadron. She length succeeded made her way boom. The moment she struck it, Chinese batteries opened her heavy guns. The gun-boats took stations astern her. Two unfortunately got aground, one northern extremity southern. "The former, however, notwithstanding still able render service forts stream. In hour one gun-boats completely disabled; her commander killed, crew forty men, nine remained unhurt; admiral himself, board, severely wounded. On he shifted his flag another vessel, he went close forts. Here he received second wound, still would quit fight. Unable move, he took his place bridge, chain he leaning shot away, he thrown deck violence one his ribs broken. Three times injured, might supposed he would retired; shifting his flag another vessel, he remained deck his cot, directed battle until, faint loss blood pain, he consented yield command senior captain, took his place. "Still battle continued; three gun-boats shore reduced mere wrecks. We had, however, vessels men sufficient carry fight. At last determined storm forts. The soldiers, marines, blue-jackets detailed purpose landed; commander American man-of-war showing his sympathy assisting his boats taking detachments storming party shore. The tide, gone out, left large banks mud channel firm ground. Through men wade many yards, covered, however, guns _Lee_, opened fire protection. Scarcely, however, left boats every gun still serviceable fort, numberless gingalls, rifles, muskets, directed upon them. "One captain mortally wounded, another severely hurt, colonel marines fell desperately wounded. The third command still led storming party. "The first ditch nearly empty water, crossed, second, close walls fort, full; here, finding his immediate followers reduced fifty men, larger party behind almost exhausted, nearly 300 stricken disastrous rush across mud--he felt his duty wait reinforcements. On sending back, however, them, commanding officer obliged refuse request order retire, men spared. As was, nearly cut off, tide rising, several boats drifted stream. Some taken possession Chinese; others recovered. During retreat Chinese kept galling fire ranks, striking many, lay helpless mud returning tide put end sufferings washing them. "Not past midnight commanders storming party, collected men could discover, embark last boat return heavy hearts ships. Six gun-boats shore, feared would lost; tide, rising higher usual next day, three floated off, others, however, remained immovable. Altogether lost 80 men killed spot, 350 wounded, many died, among one gallant officers service, Captain Vansittart. "This disaster shown us that, all, Chinese advantage strong fortifications, contemptible enemies, despise them. Of course, go unpunished last proceeding. As soon troops collected ships ready, expect go back Peiho capture Taku Forts proceed land water Pekin, which, emperor give up, bombard take possession of. So see fellows plenty work you. You need afraid that." Tom Desmond, return information received, still longer yarn spin adventures gone through. Billy occasionally put word. "The worst part business nearly starving live rotten yams train oil. How would fellows liked that?" he asked. "Not pleasant," observed Charley Roy. "But you, Billy, do not appear suffered much fare describe." "I time pick again," answered Billy; "but I assure many weeks afterwards I thin whipping-post." CHAPTER SEVEN.

The fleet lay readiness proceed Pe-chili, expected would find work do, Taku Forts captured troops, assembling strong force, could march Pekin. In mean time Captain Rogers took midshipmen shore obtain outfit them, much required. With object repaired shop Tung-Cheong, Buckmaster, Victoria. Mr Tung-Cheong came forward smiling countenance, guessing, he surveyed tattered uniforms three midshipmen, required. "Me thinkee greatest tailor world. Thinkee nothing make coat'ees three gentlemans," he observed, he pointed uniforms every possible description hanging shop. He produced midshipman's uniform, he kept specimen show he capable, taken measures, he promised three ready following evening, together every article might please order. They, course, wanted shirts, socks, caps, shoes, swords belts, which, surprise, he stock--indeed, he showed, like his countrymen, he keen eye business, would undertake fit ship's company, admiral powder-monkey. Leaving town, climbed top Victoria Peak, whence could look harbour, appearance picturesque lake, dotted vessels every rig, obtained good view town extended along shore nearly four miles. Below one side Kowloon Peninsula, covered military tents, south side seen numberless islands, wide expanse China Sea beyond. "Now let us pay visit Happy Valley," said Tom, descended heights. "It must pleasant place live in. I like take abode there," observed Billy. "Wait reach form opinion; good many inhabitants already," observed Tom, heard Wang-ne-chung Charley Roy. Billy changed his opinion got place, burial ground Hong-kong. On entering Protestant cemetery, saw column erected memory officers men 59th Regiment, regiment, course nine years, lost 644 persons, including number women upwards 100 children; greater number cut weapons enemy, pestiferous climate. On way town met soldier, holding Chinaman his pigtail, he twisted two three times round his hand. On asking Englishman he his prisoner, his reply was-- "Why, sir, chap coolie recruit; he received his pay advance, bolting, I clapped eyes him, taking back barracks." The coolie corps raised act carriers regiments going Pekin. Not troubled honesty, men took every opportunity escaping soon received advance, intending many instances enlist. On returning ship, Charley Roy told incident, occurred before. A number coolies embarked board troop-ship, one them, purchased quantity pepper, started threw eyes sentry placed him, dashing past guard, leaped overboard, swam boat waiting, succeeded making his escape. While midshipmen Hong-kong great Chinese festival going on; leave go shore, opportunity witnessing proceedings. One day met procession, consisting 3000 4000 people, many merchants tradesmen, dressed gaudiest attire, extending upwards mile length. There bands music groups figures, either carried men's shoulders wheeled along platforms, representing various somewhat incomprehensible characters, chief attractions three enormous dragons, hundred feet length, required thirty men carry them. In evening entertainment given, open all, without charge. It enormous building erected purpose, composed bamboo frame-work covered matting. The interior elegantly fitted up, lighted large numbers glass chandeliers; sides richly decorated, soon altars overhung gorgeous drapery, conservatories full flowering plants, concerts vocal instrumental music going several parts building. There also rooms light refreshments, tea, coffee, fruit, could obtained without charge. Those required substantial fare could procure booths outside large building, moderate payment. The midshipmen enjoyed themselves, voted Chinese amusing, hospitable fellows. At length ships war ordered northward. The _Empress_ call Shanghai, southern entrance great river Yang-tse-kiang. Shanghai consists large English settlement Chinese city considerable size. Soon _Empress_ come anchor, shore boat, pulled Chinese, seen approaching. "She English officers board. Who be?" exclaimed Gerald, look-out gangway, Tom. "I believe! Can possible? Yes, I nearly certain! There is Archie Gordon, Mr Joy, Commander Rawson himself. Then old _Dragon_ must escaped all." Tom sprang gangway, waved his cap. This salute replied boat, another minute alongside, Commander Rawson, lieutenant Archie, came deck. "We given lost," said Tom, he shook hands his brother midshipman. "And we, say truth, little expectation seeing again," answered Archie. "How escape?" "How find way here?" asked Tom, without answering question. Before Archie could reply, Captain Rogers came deck welcomed party. After exchanging words, commander lieutenant accompanied cabin, Archie led his old shipmates berth. Before, however, he would give account his adventures, he insisted hearing theirs, course occupied time. "And now," said Tom, "we want hear yarn. Was _Dragon_ lost? her saw rocks, unfortunate vessel?" "She _Dragon_, doubt," answered Archie. "You remember day Bonins hurricane suddenly sprang up. We got board looking you, commander, considering certainty driven shore remained were, ordered steam got up, intending run round take board. We got far, however, one boilers burst, killing half dozen men committing damage. We depend upon canvas, hurricane every instant increasing strength. The ship, however, behaved well. We ran gale four twenty hours, lull coming on, commander, wishing get back Bonins, hauled ship up. We not, however, stood long close-reefed topsails, furious blast suddenly struck her, one fell swoop carried away masts. We managed, however, get wind hoisting sail stump foremast, ran on, hoping get lee island time gale over, might rig jury masts. "Night came on; hurricane over. We anxiously looking daylight. Our belief considerable distance island, suddenly loud crash heard, sure evidence ship shore. Happily sea gone down, although she struck heavily several times, hopes she would hold together made escape. The commander, cool cucumber, told us although he could get ship off, seeing already she two three holes her bottom, lives might preserved maintained discipline exerted ourselves. When daylight came found sight small island, looked barren inhospitable, intervening reefs, sea breaking, could little hope reaching it. Outside, however, much calmer, boats could carry us all, commander determined build two rafts catamarans might convey could go boats, carry provisions water. "We hoped reach Loo-choo Islands, miss Grampus Island, half-way them. The weather coming perfectly fine, able get three rafts rigged boats prepared sea. The boats take rafts tow keep within hailing distance, steering commander might direct. With light wind eastward shoved wreck, without leaving man behind. We made slow progress, wind light rafts towed somewhat heavily, still, good spirits, except regretted loss ship could help thinking become fellows. We ran three days began look Grampus Island, weather became threatening. As barometer fell, spirits. Had boats, might time reached shore, course would desert rafts. The second lieutenant charge one raft, Josling another, I volunteered command third. Even gale spring up, altogether despair navigating rafts, might run lash escape washed off. "The wind blew stronger stronger; sea got up, night approached, matters looking disagreeable. The commander came round spoke rafts, telling us do, promising boats remain us worst come worst. The night dark squally. The catamarans rode sea better expected, although times scarcely expected see another sunrise. When day length broke, still sight other, abatement gale, could land anywhere discerned. "Though weathered one night, experience earnestly hoped might exposed still severer gale, yet seemed every likelihood wind increasing. For part, I began think pity boats expose greater danger remaining us, considering ought urge commander leave us make best way, sail appeared sight southward. As she stood towards us made her American whaler. On coming us she hove to, commander went board. We were, may supposed, little anxious know arrangements he would make master whaler. He long settling matters. In short time he made signal boats come alongside, quickly did. The stores people required pulling taken board. The boats came rafts, got towed rafts ship. The stores hoisted up, rafts cast adrift, larger boats allowed tow astern, could taken board. The American captain, bound coast Japan search whales, agreed land us Yokohama. "The voyage, however, much longer expected. We first caught heavy gale came night, compelled heave to, lost boats towing astern. A day two several whales seen, captain naturally anxious catch. As he plenty hands board, he put his boats, less three fish killed. Then cut stow away, occupied best part week. Scarcely operation concluded two whales seen taken, American captain acknowledging owing much assistance he able secure prizes. "After calms light contrary winds, voyage protracted one. We brought provisions water, though nearly exhausted. What many men board, dirty condition whaler, wonder sickness break among us doctor said, would done people lived much possible deck. "The American captain fulfilled his promise, landed us Yokohama. We detained considerable time could get across place. As soon arrived sent word Hong-kong safety, I suppose news reached place sailed." "Well, I glad, old fellow, rest escaped," said Tom, "and I hope three shall fortunate brother Jack his two friends, midshipmen." The three newly re-united friends got leave go shore together midshipmen. They first walked European settlement, handsomely laid streets running right angles other. Many houses well built, stood compounds like India. Strong wooden barriers put beads main streets, loopholes them, place could defended rebels succeed capturing native town beyond. This town short distance south European settlement. It surrounded brick wall twenty-five feet height, earthen embankment inside, forming rampart six ten feet wide. The parapet two feet thick seven high, containing embrasures large gingalls three four feet apart. Between gingall small hole parapet held earthen vessel filled slaked lime, ready flung faces enemy attempting escalade walls. A considerable number Chinese troops stationed ramparts, gay-coloured flags various devices flying heads. It seemed curious English war emperor, alliance part his troops engaged defending one his towns his rebel subjects. "This mighty dull work," exclaimed Gerald, wandering native town time. "I vote get horses take gallop country. We shall fun ride, events, perhaps see something curious." "But suppose fall Tae-pings--that would pleasant; would cut heads could explain were," observed Archie, always took cautious side. "They look upon English friends, I believe," remarked Charley Roy. "They might, sure, take us prisoners hold us hostages; however, must take care get near them, last reports Pow-shun, twenty miles least." Notwithstanding risk might run, votes decidedly favour ride horses could procured. The midshipmen time made inquiries horses let, vain. At length got Chinaman stop try understand wanted. Gerald, jumping Billy's back, sticking his heels his sides beating behind, Chinaman signified he comprehended meaning, led way along several streets reached stables containing dozen Tartar ponies, sorry-looking half-starved animals. An old man long pig-tail, dressed blue serge shirt hanging trousers material, made his appearance, recourse signs ascertain whether he would let horses, much pay. To Tom produced money, he counted hands old man, immediately pocketed it, saddled bridled one ponies, thus giving midshipmen understand he must paid beforehand. As objection this, rest followed Tom's example. "Take care go near Tae-pings," said old man, showing he accustomed dealings English, although his stock words language limited. The party, supplied sticks instead whips, set direction west gate, wide open. As enemy near supposed English officers merely make short circuit neighbourhood, allowed pass unquestioned. As soon clear walls, put horses gallop dashed along full speed, riding race, laughing shouting, great astonishment peasantry, came cottages look them. They gone far came upon small pagoda-shaped edifice, twenty feet height. Seeing man entering carrying small oblong bundle, wrapped round bamboo straw, followed him. Tom Gerald, getting horses, entered building. Round shelves, number similar bundles seen; pair small feet sticking one bundles revealed contents, upon inquiries man ascertained "baby tower," remains infants whose parents poor afford ordinary funeral deposited, full cleared municipal authorities. "What wonderfully methodical people Chinese are," said Archie; "but certainly curious ways things." The road passed well made country highly cultivated, corn paddy fields gardens full vegetables fruit trees; ditches full water irrigate ground ran directions, picturesque bridges, larger ones stone, others wood bamboo. People work fields, employed turning water-wheels, raise water higher lands. The cottages low, full windows, deep caves, lightly built seemed moderate gale would blow away. The midshipmen gone considerable distance, much further, indeed, intended, everything looked peaceable could fancy risk, concluded rebels must long way off. At last, getting hungry thirsty, looked hopes discovering tea-house might obtain refreshments. Meeting peasants, seemed, road-side, inquired usual language signs could get something eat. The men pointed west, signified would soon come village could obtain wanted. "Probably much further; let us ride on," said Charley Roy. They galloped forward, mistaken, good-sized village appeared sight, one first houses description search of. The host chin-chinned approached, welcomed his establishment. Having fastened horses stable close hand, food water given them, entered tea house, cakes, biscuits, sweetmeats, tea wonderfully small cups, placed them. "I say, I wonder whether old fellow has not got something substantial this?" exclaimed Billy. "Some beef steaks mutton chops, supply vegetables, would purpose." All signs made, however, produced nothing supply fare, despatched rapidity calculated astonish host, seen looking round apparently calculating much he charge. After repast, strolled garden behind house, containing arbours, miniature ponds filled fish, canals crossed bamboo bridges, beds tulips gay flowers. As visitors, made home, lighted cigars took possession arbours, Billy amused trying catch fish his hands swam gaze strange creature looking upon them. "This really jolly," said Desmond. "We patronise friend come way, although I wish I could make understand want something better cakes tea." They resting time, two three party dropping sleep, sound distant shouts cries reached ears. The noises grew louder louder. Presently host appeared door, gesticulating wildly, pointing way come. Some straggling shots heard. "The place must taken rebels, business fight them, best thing make scarce," exclaimed Archie Gordon. "We shall knocked head do not," cried Charley Roy, starting up. "Come, lads, sooner horseback better." Tom, shouting his companions, led way towards house. The host vanished, caught sight hurrying bundle one arm, box other, basket his back. The doors open, quickly rushed house towards stables. The grooms fled, fortunately carrying steeds, munching away hay. To slip bridles tighten girths take long. "Now, boys," cried Tom, "discretion case best part valour." "We shall get preciously wigged first lieutenant lose heads, coming business be," cried Gerald. As led horses, saw people hurrying directions across fields, scampering along road follow. Behind them, end village, came confused multitude, whether fugitives pursuers could make out. One thing certain, delayed would get serious trouble, lose lives. "Mount, mount, let us off!" cried Tom. "Here, Billy, I lend hand," he lifted his messmate, whose steed somewhat restive, his saddle; he leaped his own. Only minute lost midshipmen mounted, minute consequence. The cries rear grew louder; several shots came whizzing past ears. "On! on!" shouted Tom. "I bring rear," and, giving whack Billy's pony, he drew instant let others pass him. They altogether galloped fast steeds could move nimble legs. Half-starved animals looked, went good pace. Should pursuers foot, would soon beyond danger shot. Tom occasionally turned glance his shoulder. Still people behind, whoever were, came rushing on, though distanced seemed confused, dark-coloured mass could distinguished. "We shall soon beyond reach," shouted Tom; "it will not pull distanced thoroughly." Soon afterwards, he looked again, he saw dark mass divided, he could distinguish sword blades flashing sun waved there. "There cavalry sort us," he cried out. As far he could judge distance, horsemen engaged cutting native peasantry, overtaken unprepared resistance. "If make horses go faster, must so," cried Tom. "Those fellows astern mean mischief, must keep well ahead, trying sharpness sabres necks." The party require exhortation best make steeds move forward faster, urging rein reiterated whacks back sticks. The hoofs animals clattered hard ground, sending clouds dust. The day advanced supposed, darkness would favour find road might turn gain city another entrance. "How far got go?" inquired Desmond, shouting Tom. "That I tell; I know came good long way," answered Tom; "but horses carry us stick backs. Keep good hand reins. Whatever do, do not let tumble down." Though Tom encouraged his companions, he feel sure would escape. He could distinguish flags spears, well sword blades. The horsemen behind becoming every instant distinct. Much depended strength pursuers' horses. If already come good way morning might tired soon knock up, fresh might ere long overtake midshipmen. "If overtake us, must stand make fight it," cried Tom. "No doubt that," answered Desmond. "It never cut like sheep, running away." "But long run will," cried Tom. "If come us, idea leap horses ditch fence, may suitable, left, wheel round charge attempt follow us." Roy rest agreed Tom's proposal. "I do not think cavalry carbines, cannot shoot us distance, pistol bullets reach farther lance points." Tom taken command party tacit consent, one disposed dispute his authority. There time, however, saying much. As went along Tom satisfaction observing enemy appear much, all, gaining upon them. This raised his hopes. They already made good several miles, Charley Roy proposed halt, breathe horses ascertain whether still pursued. Scarcely, however, stopped, clattering pursuers' horses' hoofs sounded ears, mingled shouts riders. "We must push on, whether nags like not," cried Tom; "if distance them, enemy likely give chase, know run risk cut get near town." Again party galloped forward. Even short halt enabled Tae-pings gain them, rebels' voices sounded considerably louder. "All right! bow chasers, firing us," cried Tom, laughing; "they ride nothing, I hope, all." Two three miles got over. The midshipmen began look lanterns city walls, which, time, expected see. Near, however, might place refuge, foes still continued pursuit, danger. Their steeds, too, giving evident signs knocked up, keep sticks going make poor animals move forward. Presently, came Billy's horse, sending rider clear head, Billy narrowly escaping kick heels animal directly him. Tom, without stopping see become Billy, pulled up, fortunately succeeded catching animal's reins. "Where you, Billy?" he shouted out; "not hurt, I hope?" "Not much, knee," answered Billy, he hobbled climbed his saddle. The rest party, seeing occurred, galloped on. Billy's horse, like his rider, cut knees, seemed unwilling continue headlong race long running. "You must make get along," said Tom, applying his stick animal's back. "I do not want head cut off, I do not want leave behind." Short delay, serious consequence, Tom looked round he could distinctly see enemy coming them. Billy, good rider, cried he again, he got one his feet stirrup. "Never mind; hold hands, I will lead horse," cried Tom, seizing rein. He wish delay rest party, he shout stop, he determined push forward long horses could keep legs. Billy short time succeeded getting his foot stirrup. "Now," said Tom, "if leap, do not pulling rein, let horse his head, stick like wax." In mean time rest party pushed forward, Gerald surprised Tom answer question; he shouted him, still fancying he close behind. "There is light ahead," he cried out; "it must walls, else house suburbs." "If walls, would appear higher," answered Archie, "What think, Tom?" he asked. No reply came Tom, looking round Roy discovered Tom Billy nowhere seen. "We must wait them," cried Archie; "we cannot leave behind." Before, however, he his companions could pull up, loud challenge heard, several shots came whizzing past them. "If stop attempt gallop back look them, shall another volley," said Roy. "I ride forward slowly. That must piquet Indian regiment stationed outside town. They mistake us enemy, may aim better next time fire." Without waiting his companions' reply, Roy rode forward, shouting, "Friends, friends! English, English!" At length he came sight party men drawn across road, English officer, advancing, inquired he was. He explained pursued body cavalry, supposed Tae-pings, he much feared two companions fallen hands. The officer ordered his men advance, careful fire he gave word. Roy, riding forward, quickly overtook Archie Gerald. On either side bank covered shrubs, would afford concealment dusk whole party. On seeing this, officer told Roy go little distance halt, immediately he hear rebels advancing, gallop back towards town. "You may, I hope, meet friends, not, fallen hands rebels, shall good chance rescuing them." "I understand, carry direction," said Roy, three midshipmen rode slowly back, hoping every instant fall Tom Billy. Their disappointment bitter nowhere seen. They not, however, gone far, saw Tae-ping horsemen moving rapidly towards them, neither Tom his companions visible. On immediately turned horses' heads galloped back, told do, direction town, feeling dreadfully anxious fate friends. They got little distance beyond ambush rapid succession shots told Indian soldiers opened fire enemy. They pulled up, feeling sure Tae-pings would venture advance further. In right, returned saw rapid flight, soldiers still firing them. "You saved lives, I believe, sir," said Roy, addressing officer, advanced meet him. "What become companions?" "I afraid Tae-pings must overtaken them, probably, immediately cut down, certainly party got fire. My men tell saw English uniforms." "If killed, must lying road," said Desmond, his heart sinking within he spoke. "We must go look them." To officer made objection, sent forward five men sergeant. They proceeded even beyond Tom Billy last seen. Although came dead bodies several Tae-pings, shot soldiers, could discover trace friends. "Then must carried prisoners," observed Desmond. "However, better killed, may possibly recover them." Any search useless; indeed, officer anxious send back town give notice Tae-pings neighbourhood, cavalry force advanced far without infantry support them. The whole party accordingly returned house outpost stationed. Gerald Archie much cut thought Tom's loss--though, truth known, care much poor Billy,--that felt scarcely able ride back, glad accept lieutenant's offer refreshment returned city. "They will cutting poor fellows' heads," cried Gerald. "How come miss them? I would gone I had not thought close heels." "Nor would I," said Archie; "it is blundering fellow Billy Blueblazes. He must tumbled his horse, Tom would not leave him." The lieutenant could give little consolation. The Tae-pings, reports received, committed horrible cruelties places taken, captured Pow-shun put death indiscriminately men, women, children; defeated Imperialist troops joined assisted plundering place. "Our horses must rested; time us going back," said Roy last. Thanking lieutenant, mounted. Just got outside house heard sound homes' hoofs. "Do not fire!" cried officer his men. "These must friends." In another moment two horsemen seen coming along road, Gerald, dashing forward, shouted out, "Hurrah! Why, it is Tom Rogers Billy Blueblazes!" Gerald mistaken, although friends could scarcely distinguished masses mud covered steeds. Tom Billy received congratulations party, introduced lieutenant, explained finding Tae-pings gaining upon them, leaped ditch bordered trees, concealed view pursuers, galloped along soft ground, scramble number ditches, wide leap, they, catching sight lights village, made way back road. As Tom Billy wet through, declined stop take cup hot tea, whole party galloped on, fast tired steeds could go, town, managed find way back stable hired horses. The old man examined his lantern, exhibiting rueful countenance, shaking his head, muttering he so, "No good, good!" Tom tried explain ridden hard, he would never seen his horses; probably midshipman's explanations understood, owner animals still kept muttering, "No good, good!" "Well, partly fault delaying long, I propose pay old fellow something more," said Tom. All agreed, and: Mr Kay Chung's countenance brightened greatly handed coin. On way back met several English inhabitants, reported force Tae-pings neighbourhood. Their news created small amount stir place. Information already received head-quarters outposts, immediately active preparations made defence town, lest enemy advance night. Pretty well tired out, midshipmen last got back hotel settled remain night, late time return board. Tom Billy sorry turn in, Chinese waiter undertook get jackets trousers cleaned polished next morning. Tom sleeping several hours, Gerald, followed Roy, different room, rushed in, exclaiming, "Rouse up, old fellows; something serious going on. There is tremendously heavy firing last ten minutes direction Chinese town, doubt Tae-pings attacking place. We starting see fun." "Fun, call it!" said Archie, awakened Gerald's first exclamation. "It fun rebels take Shanghai, small garrison defence. As likely Chinese run away, probably fraternise Tae-pings." "The marines Indian regiment sufficient drive back enemy, shall blue-jackets shore, depend upon it, Captain Rogers hears going forward," said Roy. "Come, Tom, going us? I suppose nothing induce Billy turn out, he help it." "But clothes, clothes! Chinese waiter Fau-ti got them. I nothing put on." "I unearth him, make bring you," said Desmond; "and Billy's also, he will not like left behind." While Desmond went find waiter, Billy, sitting bed, rubbing his eyes, asked row about. On told, he answered-- "Let fight themselves; I do not see interfere," lying down, he compose sleep, Roy Archie, seizing clothes, effectually roused up. The firing heard closer before, apparently extending considerable space. Billy, much he disinclined leave his bed, like left behind, forgetting his clothes taken away, began hunting them. "If cannot find them, must come are. Wrap sheet; help scare enemy, events," said Roy. Desmond last returned, followed waiter bringing midshipmen's uniforms. Although long dressing, time spent, yet daylight. There general commotion going forward house, inmates calling other, inquiring happening. When midshipmen got door house found large party collected, arms hand full fight. For could tell contrary, however, Tae-pings might already scaled walls. Just setting off, tramp large body men heard approaching. The midshipmen recognised Captain Rogers blue-jackets marines his ship, several officers. Tom joined his brother, confessed about, narrowly escaped caught rebels. "You means, however, putting garrison alert, messenger came request land men informed party midshipmen brought intelligence approach enemy." Tom well pleased hear this, he hoped he his companions would escape reprimand expected receive gone far city. The sound heavy guns heard, shot occasionally pitched ground great distance front them, showing enemy could far outside walls. "They yet got inside, shall time help drive succeed," said Jack. A Chinese officer sent guide seamen part walls defenders required support. Just arrived guns pointed direction ceased firing, large bodies men seen gloom approaching scaling ladders. "We shall soon tumble fellows make attempt escalade walls," said Tom. The rebels, however, showed want pluck. In another instant ladders placed walls, numbers pig-tailed fellows, broad hats, holding shields heads, began climb up, spite hot fire marines blue jackets poured upon them. They evidently expected meet reception, supposing place defended countrymen armed matchlocks spears. Along whole line wall, different points, scene enacted. Thousands men crowding forward, expecting numbers overcome limited garrison, every place met determined courage, civilians vying soldiers repelling foe. Captain Rogers ordered another party seamen join second lieutenant soon boats could bring shore, finding determined way rebels attacking part walls he directed defend, he sent back Tom Desmond hurry forward. The midshipmen met party half-way, Tom delivered message. Under belief he knew road, he led several narrow streets, suddenly he discovered he made mistake, whether he ought kept left right, he could tell. Sharp firing, however, heard right, he concluded direction he ought taken. The party moved forward double. The walls soon rose them, shot, came like hail, showed enemy firing away hard ever. Just then, end short street caught sight large body men moving away them. "I wonder fellows come from?" remarked lieutenant. "They making gate rode yesterday," observed Tom. "Probably enemy attacking it; go assist, though appear Chinese, likely make much stand," observed lieutenant. The seamen dashed forward, reached gate, front them, thrown open, party seen, turning round, rushed back way come, followed many others streaming gate. "There treachery work here," exclaimed lieutenant, ordering his men halt fire, poured volley upon advancing mass. Before rebels could recover confusion unexpected shower bullets thrown them, blue jackets midst, cutting down, knocking over, making turn try escape gate. This put stop progress still outside, seamen, led gallant officer, fought way gate. Here desperate struggle ensued. A big Tae-ping point cutting Tom, when, cutlass intervening, brought Tae-ping blow head ground, Tom saw his old shipmate, Jerry Bird, he recognised, slashing away right left his side. The rebels length forced out, lieutenant ordered gates shut. This easy matter, space either side covered dead wounded, seamen, hauling bodies way, last succeeded. One party remained guard gate, made prisoners many could catch treacherously opened it. Tom, Jerry Bird three men, sent inform Captain Rogers occurred, he might despatch people gates prevent trick played. "You rendered good service now," said Tom Jerry Bird, "in saving head sword big Tae-ping. He would cut certainty. I shall never forget it." "Lor' bless you, sir, I am well pleased are; I would not killed, no, made port admiral, I hope, ever comes another occasion, I may same." "Still, saved life, I grateful whether pleasure not," said Tom. There much time conversation, however. As hurried on, keep look-out, lest might attacked traitors within walls, would liked revenged defeated treacherous object. Several suspicious-looking characters approached, dreading cutlasses British seamen, retired respectful distance. Tom his party quickly made way part walls Captain Rogers his men stationed, Tom delivered his message. On receiving it, Jack immediately despatched midshipmen information officers commanding neighbourhood gates, might guard intended treachery. The rebels, supposing friends got inside city, continued make feints directions, keep garrison employed, fully believing place would short time theirs. Along whole line, far eye could reach either side appeared rapid series flames fire, summits walls below, defenders assailants exchanged fire. The assault continued daylight breaking exposed rebels clearly view, they, probably believing prospect success, ceased firing along whole line, began rapidly retreat. The officer command, seeing this, sent considerable body men west gate, pursued distance, giving lesson likely would wish repeated. The Chinese soldiers cut heads took. The English sailors contented depriving fugitives pig-tails, generally giving probe back applied final stroke. The whole ground distance strewn dead, walls lay still thickly, proving desperation fought, hot fire poured upon them. Captain Rogers his men remained shore ascertained rebels retreated Pow-shun, twenty miles off, appeared probability returning. Information received, however, plundering provinces every direction, murdering inhabitants, committing every possible species cruelty. An English regiment also arrived Hong-kong reinforce garrison, longer slightest fear rebels would succeed taking place. Captain Rogers his men returned board _Empress_, man-of-war seen standing anchorage. She made signal _Orion_. "Why, that is ship uncle Adair said appointed," observed Archie Gerald. "I hope he got her. I shall glad see him, better fellow exist, I shall know mysterious matter I go home," said Gerald. The _Orion_ brought short distance _Empress_. In less half hour boat put her. "There is doubt it; that is uncle Adair," said Gerald, watching his glass. "He is coming board, I feel like young lady going proposal made her. I hope he come he will not insist sending home." In short time Captain Adair stepped side. Having received due honour, he heartily welcomed Captain Rogers, he accompanied, he shaken hands his nephew, cabin. "I am much wiser I before," observed Gerald; "but I suppose he send soon." Gerald, however, endure his suspense time longer. Tom faithfully kept secret he entrusted, Gerald faint idea piece good fortune store him. While two captains conference, handsome Chinese boat came off, mandarin rank stepped deck. He "chin-chinned" midshipmen drew either side gangway honour, captains, hearing his arrival, came receive him. He course "chin-chinned" them, when, interpreter he brought him, he stated "he come make request he hoped would denied." Captain Rogers answered "that he happy render service his power." The mandarin replied, "that although he consider favour great one, trouble would so." "Pray state, friend, is," said Jack. "Understand, beloved brother died days ago malignant fever, his body deposited Ning-foo Jos-house, outside city walls. He belongs Teit-sin, his family reside, difficulty sending merchant vessel, I shall feel deeply obliged convey his coffin place, may deposited his august ancestors," answer. Adair, he heard said, could refrain bursting fit laughter. Jack tried compose his countenance he told mandarin much regret he must refuse his request, ship would certainly get far Teit-sin, usual men-of-war carry dead bodies, except rare instances; people died board, buried sea, and, especially sanitary reasons, he could receive person died malignant fever. In vain mandarin pleaded his brother shut tightly would slightest annoyance. Jack firm, mandarin return allow his brother remain Jos-house navigation opened. Terence brought word _Empress_ proceed mouth Peiho Gulf Pe-chili, resolved recapture Taku Forts march army Pekin, emperor immediately yield demands British ambassador. The summer begun weather remarkably fine. The two ships sailed along company, getting steam wind fell light. Gerald Billy Blueblazes transferred _Orion_, berth _Bellona_ overcrowded. Some crew unfortunate _Dragon_ also sent her, remainder kept board distributed among ships squadron, officers gone Hong-kong Commander Rawson, await passage home. Mr Joy joined _Orion_ lieu her third lieutenant, invalided. Gerald, soon he opportunity, waited vain his uncle speak subject, asked informed matter he sent home. "The uncertainties connected great, I unwilling disturb mind subject," answered Adair. "You know distant relative, Lord Saint Maur, fine estate numerous heirs succeed him. One other, however, died. Immediately hearing I put matter hands clever Dublin lawyer, tells direct descendants last lord died, necessary go several generations back, former Lord Saint Maur, grandfather lineal descendant, lines become extinct, rightful heir title estate. Other Desmonds, however, appeared, made similar claim, question best. They money, which, unfortunately, not; Dublin friend confident he undertaken matter his risk. You, events, lose nothing, may gain case; time, I must confess I sanguine subject. At first so, I sent home, time I arrived different conclusion, would advise think matter, though, day succeed, well good. It pleasant Viscount Saint Maur owner fine estate, perhaps would much happier. If stick navy get promoted due course, much thing hundred years hence." Gerald quite agree his uncle philosophic view he took case; time, he determined bother affair. He sorry parted Tom Archie, Billy Blueblazes instead, rest his shipmates strangers him. The _Bellona_ _Orion_ quick run rendezvous Sha-la-tung shoal, twenty miles Pehtang. On way, near entrance gulf, came fleet conveying troops intended disembarked near mouth Peiho. It magnificent sight, clouds canvas appeared covering blue ocean, ships' bows dashing spray, sparkled sunshine clove onward way. Among numerous steamers, wind fair also sail. The despatch vessels gun-boats moving about, enforcing orders bringing slower craft. The ships arrived destination took position line, according division, brigade, regiment troops board, confusion avoided admiral furnished captain plan showing place he anchor. The next day French fleet arrived, whole force moved nearer shore. The smaller craft could cross bar Pehtang, mouth town name. Early morning first August signal made gun-boats small steamers attached fleet take many troops could board, tow boats carrying others, whole flotilla commenced steaming slowly towards Pehtang. As would dangerous gun-boats attack forts crowded condition, proceeded spot 2000 yards south it. The country presented anything attractive appearance, could seen extensive mud flat, raised causeway, running Pehtang towards Taku, deep ditches cut purpose drainage, likely prove disagreeable places cross. The boats men-of-war employed also landing troops. Tom command one _Empress's_ boats, Gerald one _Orion's_, opportunity seeing going forward. As boats approached, Chinese soldiers showed themselves, perceiving strength force invading country, wisely beat retreat. Among first approach shore commander-in-chief. It impossible get close bank. He surveyed extent mud him; pulling his shoes stockings, rolling his trousers, he leaped overboard, his example followed his officers men. Together splashed waded upwards half mile horrible black mud. The French brigade landed left, manner neighbourhood, finding somewhat harder ground, first reach causeway. A cavalry picquet appeared drawbridge across causeway, watching movements allies, also, troops floundered on, mounted horses rode dignified pace southward towards Taka. The whole day occupied landing troops. In evening ascertained forts Pehtang abandoned. It intended march take possession, private information obtained Chinese garrison left numerous infernal machines placed long fuses would explode among troops entering. The Chinaman given information compelled point horrible engines destruction hidden, removed men sent forward purpose. The army landed, could called, pass night mud flats causeway, destitute water food, without tents, wet ground alone men could stretch themselves. It pleasant commencement campaign. Jack Desmond agreed reason thankful comfortable ship sleep in. The next morning daybreak gun-boats entered river, troops advancing position occupied town, unhappy inhabitants ejected make room them. It one sad necessities warfare compelled turn poor people. Children arms, old men women, years left homes, forced seek shelter, found; many men destroyed families rather expose perils would meet with. The English took quarters one part town, French other. It said contained 20,000 inhabitants, abandoned army scarcely found. Among thus destroyed man given important information respecting infernal machines, he his whole family put death. Although, except volunteers, blue-jackets officers little prospect fighting, work enough landing troops stores, thus engaged hours day night many days together. "There little honour glory gained, I see, though useful, I dare say," observed Desmond Tom, boats twelve hours stretch. "However, I do not mind help soldiers lick Celestials, deserve sound drubbing, events." The soldiers worse sailor brethren. Rain came down, rendering town almost uninhabitable horrible smells arose, mud many places several feet deep. Such detestable spot army cooped nearly fortnight. The allied armies captured Taku Forts, smaller steamers entered river greatly aided army conveying troops stores Teit-sin; naval men saw anything subsequent operations, terminated surrender Pekin destruction emperor's summer palace, establishment peace British Chinese.

The Taku Forts captured, march Pekin accomplished, summer palace destroyed, pride emperor humbled, peace established. Her Majesty's ships _Bellona_ _Empress_ lay Victoria Harbour, broad pennant Commodore Murray, he lately raised rank, flying board former. He Captain Rogers seated cabin his ship dinner. The officers commodore's guests retired, midshipmen previously received polite hint go deck ascertain way wind blew. "I heartily hope shall soon ordered away undelectable coast," observed Jack. "So I, truth," answered Murray. "From I hear, shall soon sent Japan, seems unsettled state Mikado, Tycoon, Damios loggerheads. If latter especially put down, get upper hand two spiritual temporal sovereigns, set work murder other, whole country thrown state anarchy." "I glad something do, events," said Jack. "The gun-boats work nowadays, reduced Celestials order much prospect big ships wanted." "Had I reason proceeding definite direction I would sail to-morrow," observed commodore; "but object cruising coast, expending coals wearing ship." "I sometimes tempted wish steam power never introduced board men-of-war I think early days _Racer_ Mediterranean, life led coast Africa here," said Jack. "After all, youngsters best it." "They certainly cares responsibilities, enjoy sounder sleep command sea," observed Murray. While speaking, Archie Gordon, cap hand, entered cabin, addressing commodore said, "A Chinaman come board, sir, far understand, desires see report his junk time ago attacked carried pirates." "I see once; let come below," answered commodore. "Request Mr Chin-ho, interpreter, come here." "He gone shore, sir," replied midshipman. In less minute Gordon returned, ushering stout-built Chinaman, dressed, English eyes, unnautical costume, characteristic strange people. "What got say, friend?" asked Murray, visitor made usual salutation requested sit down, Murray properly made rule treat Chinese due courtesy. The stranger introduced Po-ho, captain big junk _Round Moon_. As curious jargon he made his statement would understood readers, must give ordinary English. "The _Round Moon_ lying Swatow roads, company several trading junks, I, asleep cabin, awakened loud noise deck, shrieks cries, clashing swords, scuffling thumps, though men falling. Rushing see matter, horror discover deck possession strangers, crew lay dead dying. My mate two three others still fighting bravely, far cabin door, I beheld Englishman, Jull name, I knew fearful scoundrel, sword covered blood his hand, attack mate others. Before I could run back get arms, Jull killed mate, rest cut down. Seeing I share fate, I jumped cabin port water, intending swim junk astern, Jull, followed cabin, discovering I overboard, fired me, missed. I thought I escape, presently another shot struck back; still I swam on, reached side junk. "When I got board, first thing I saw ship sails set, standing harbour. I wanted captain junk picked give chase, he answered, `No, no; Jull got many men long guns.' Before I could say anything I fainted. When I came myself, _Round Moon_ sight. I seen her since, wishing recover her, I ceased inquiring Jull every place I touched. A days ago, I sailing Chusan, I heard Jull, command large fleet junks, attacked plundered number merchant vessels neighbourhood, he even anchor his fleet channel island Latea Chusan. If go northward steamers, may arrive time catch he sails away. He nearly thirty junks, carrying heavy guns gingalls, 500 600 men. Your steamers cannot get creek attack him, he likely make his escape he knows coming. You must, therefore, send large force, careful approach, he fights rope round his neck, he struggle last." This narrative took long time deliver, Mr Po-ho, though he professed speak English fluently, search words express himself, Murray Rogers cross-question make repeat he said could comprehend his meaning. The above, however, said, substance his statement, reduced plain English. Murray inquired whether Mr Po-ho, rather Captain Po-ho, ready go pilot. He jumped offer. Nothing would give satisfaction see Jull's head cut off. "We go," said Murray. "Return board, Jack; hoist blue Peter, fire guns bring officers men may shore. I same, sail evening. Are ready, Captain Po-ho?" The Chinaman's little eyes twinkled satisfaction. "He would," he said, "send his boat back let his friends know he found generous Englishmen avenge his loss, expressed hope his junk recovered, she would restored him." That night two ships, officers board--with exception two three, who, gone side island, left shore--were steaming northward. Just sighted Chusan, vessel sail seen standing north-east. As she approached she made signal _Orion_, she despatches commodore. The _Bellona's_ way therefore stopped, _Empress_ also waiting her. In short time Captain Adair came board. He come Japan request ships station might sent protect British interests, subjects, property, constant danger Damios. The commodore decided, however, matter urgent prohibit his first looking pirate his fleet, resolved carry his object, taking _Orion_ him. At Chusan, he called obtain information, he found gun-boat, _Gnat_, which, her small size, would able play important part expedition. From information furnished Captain Po-ho, Murray learned pirate's stronghold midst several small islands, four navigable channels leading it, prevent escape villains would necessary watch whole them. The pirate also, Po-ho said, strong battery shore, guns commanding deep bay, junks anchor. Thus boats expedition would exposed hot fire, junks captured, might immediately sunk, could carried off, guns fort, described strong originally, since occupied pirates employed still adding defences. It said also within stored large amount merchandise, obtained pirates several cruises. One thing appeared certain, piratical fleet still anchor fort. The commodore, obtained necessary information, stood his squadron late day towards islands, he might arrive darkness would conceal his movements. Po-ho advised three entrances guarded, one ships, gun-boat boats proceed attack pirates. This suggestion adopted. Murray ordered three boats ship, strong body blue-jackets, rendezvous alongside _Gnat_, also carried larger number marines. Captain Rogers, accompanied Po-ho pilot interpreter, went board _Gnat_ took command. The three midshipmen charge boat, old friend Jos Green, others command lieutenants mates. Tom accompanied Billy Blueblazes Tim Nolan. The _Gnat_, taking fleet boats tow, steered towards entrance chief channel, expedition proceed. As neared dawn, rocket seen rise, forming arch dark sky, glittering drops shining brilliantly fell. It fired apparently centre island, fort supposed situated, signal junks might anchor near entrance one channels. As Captain Po-ho could give exact account position fort, Captain Rogers thought prudent wait daybreak commencing attack. Of character enemy, however, he doubt, information obtained Chusan. They daring band pirates, long terror traders. The _Gnat_, long line boats astern, made slow way. A bright look-out kept, lest junks might attempt steal escape; none appeared. The rocket, however, evidence pirate fleet, events, still inside. The entrance length gained. The shore either side close that, enemy concealed among rocks shrubs, might greatly annoyed flotilla without risk much damage themselves. When morning broke _Gnat_ approaching long, low, rocky point, masts considerable fleet junks could perceived. The steamer must time discovered pirates, junks' sails hoisted, wind favouring them, stood away towards channel opposite direction. "The villains soon find made mistake, expect get way," observed Tom Blueblazes. "They fall frying-pan fire. The shots ships send every one bottom." Just _Gnat_ grounded sand-bank, boats take oars she made efforts back off. While she thus engaged, junks seen returning anchorage, sweeping along good speed. "The rascals discovered caught trap, and, like rats driven corner, fight desperately," said Tom. "We shall real work do, Billy." "I do not mind much that, provided soon get back breakfast," answered midshipman. "I terribly hungry already." This delay enabled greater part pirate fleet get back anchorage, wind blowing stronger sun rose, three them, unable make headway it, turned another channel, expecting probably escape direction, thus unable render assistance companions. On Captain Rogers ordered three boats, Tom's one, go chase fugitives capture them, hoping, prisoners might taken, ascertain strength fort, he might devise best way attacking it. The second lieutenant _Empress_ led boats, Desmond's making third. Away pulled hard could go. The pirates, seeing coming, opened stern guns, time kept pretty hot fire gingalls; shot generally flew boats, which, although junks sailed well, rapidly coming them. "I take headmost; board two," sang lieutenant, addressing Tom Desmond. In boat, said, four marines, who, return, fired junks, taking steady aim, seldom failing kill wound crews. The channel took several turnings, would advantage pursuers acquainted navigation, fear running rocks sand-banks made keep directly astern junks. Presently shot struck one Tom's men, another knocked oar pieces. This course caused delay, boat dropped astern. On rounding point Tom saw junk he ordered board act running ashore small bay side, two junks continued course, pursued lieutenant Desmond. Tom considered his duty attack one could longer escape him. He soon alongside; he his men clambered deck pirates rushed forward, leaped bows beach, began make way inland. Tom, looking round elevated position he gained, discovered creek ran back fort, far he could tell. "We must capture fellows; Captain Rogers wants prisoners," he sang out, lead way bows Tim Nolan exclaimed, "The villains set craft fire. She will going like sky-rocket another minute." "Back, back boat!" shouted Tom, seeing Tim's words likely prove true. The whole party quickly tumbled in, man trying first. Tom last leave his prize, followed little reluctance. Shoving off, pulled away direction going, assist, necessary, boats. They got far, however, Tom caught sight pirates landed. They halted, appeared intended return stranded junk. In hurry thrown gingalls, armed swords. "We must fellows," cried Tom. Steering his boat, he jumped shore, followed marines four seamen, he told Billy remain charge rest crew. Off little party dashed, hoping without difficulty capture pirates. The latter turned fled, leading pursuers distance boat. Tom imprudently rushing considerably ahead his men volley fired among rocks laid three number low. The rest halted return fire concealed enemy, but, seeing one, let fly among rooks, bullets flattened, without execution. Before could re-load party desperadoes sprang out, seizing Tom, dragged along them. In vain Tom endeavoured free himself, expecting every instant feel point sword, edge, back his neck. The survivors his party charged bravely, hoping recover him; another volley wounded two more, and, seeing would cut off, retreated towards boat. They would even probably attacked Billy, showing unusual discretion hearing firing, landed rest men, fired advancing pirates. What his dismay find Tom among returning. "Where Mr Rogers?" he exclaimed. "The pirates, sir, got hold him," answered Tim, reluctantly returned. "If quick it, rest come us, overtake them, get back Mr Rogers, events." Billy rest men could resist appeal, rushing forward came three men fallen. One dead, two still living, though unable walk. They entreated might carried back boat; Billy, finding pirates disappeared, judged would use pursuing them, he remembered also he directed remain boat. Notwithstanding, therefore, Nolan's remark, Billy ordered men back boat. Just instant junk, attention diverted, flames fore aft, blew loud explosion, portions fragments scattered far wide, many falling close them. "Shove off!" cried Billy; "not moment must lost." His crew pulled away lieutenant Desmond, hopes succeeded taking two junks, obtaining assistance going search Tom. On getting round point hid sight, Billy discovered junks, nearly mile away, shore. As his boat got nearer he caught glimpses pirates running among bushes, direction, far he could judge, fort. Both junks had, therefore, captured. Billy hoped pirates attempted trick played him, laying trains magazines, although he half expected, he reached junks, see blow air. In his eagerness save his shipmates, he almost forgot poor Tom. "Give way, lads, give way!" he cried. "They sent like sky-rockets do not warn time." The seamen made boat fly water, understanding danger fully he did. As he got near he shouted out, "Back, back boats, blown up!" "No fear that, now," answered Desmond, deck nearest junk. "We found burning fusee, sure enough, took good care throw overboard. Hallo! where is Rogers?" he exclaimed, looking boat. "Gone! The pirates got hold him, may probably cut his head off," answered Billy. "Gone! His head off!" cried Desmond, agony grief, although scarcely believing his messmate's account; "How come away without him?" "We could help it," answered Billy, melancholy tone. "We killed not. We lost two poor fellows knocked over, four wounded. That shows give attempt rescue Rogers chance success." "Pull round report Mr Norman occurred. I go you," said Desmond, jumping Billy's boat. The lieutenant was, course, greatly grieved. "We must try ascertain his fate, events. You see his head cut off?" he asked, turning Billy. "No, sir. We saw pirates' hands. They dragging along." "Then, perhaps intend holding hostage," observed Mr Norman. "The junks appear much them; so, fear lest pirates get board again, set fire, pull back lost Rogers." Mr Norman gave order, seamen executed delight school-boys igniting huge bonfires, three boats pulled back direction still burning junk. On reaching Mr Norman landed his men, forming regular order Tom done, four marines advancing skirmishing order feel way. No enemy, however, appeared; experienced officer, he knew might lurking great distance ahead, concealed behind brushwood either right hand left, might attack moment flank get behind his retreat. Having advanced therefore short distance, he ordered halt, getting close hill top he hoped obtain survey country, he climbed it, accompanied Desmond. "There is fort, sir," exclaimed latter, "and I see number men going it. If cut Rogers's head, taking them, he will run great risk killed _Gnat_ opens fire fort." Mr Norman thought Desmond right his conjectures. "Could make dash rear fort? might get pirates know coming," said Desmond. "With stronger party I would try could do; pirates must watching us, would prepared attack, I much doubt succeed." Desmond, though eager try rescue Tom, whose death he yet far convinced, acknowledged his lieutenant right. They remained minutes longer, taking perfect survey fortress surrounding country. "If I mistake not, could land right side it, might make way, concealed mass brushwood rear fort, get close discovered, pirates, expect us make attempt, looking us open ground left; must get back communicate Captain Rogers," observed lieutenant. Mr Norman, directly he came hill, ordered his men retreat. As soon board, boats pulled away _Gnat_ fast crews could lay backs oars, knowing importance placing wounded surgeon's care soon possible. Two poor fellows required doctoring, bodies carried, nevertheless, purpose giving them, Jack called it, "decent burial?"--in reality might sewn neatly hammocks, shot feet, carry oozy bed ocean beyond ken sharks. The _Gnat_ got off, musquito fleet tow steaming towards pirates' stronghold. As Mr Norman's three boats passed within long range fort, several shots fired without damage, pirates make chase, might done good chance capturing enemies. At last boats got alongside _Gnat_. Captain Rogers received account Mr Norman gave much concern. "But certain he killed? Did one see fall?" he inquired. "No, sir," answered Mr Norman. "We confident he made prisoner; belief pirates, revenge destruction junks, would cut his head unless induced hold hostage." "I trust latter case, may manage get hands," observed Captain Rogers. "But anxiety save I must neglect duty. We must attack fellows without delay. Unfortunately time preparations, give us trouble would case craft got shore. I purpose, boats attack junks, land marines storm fort." Captain Adair come board, Captain Rogers directed accompany marines small body blue-jackets. "I believe, sir, may able get rear fort landing-place I discovered I came along," said Mr Norman. "While _Gnat_ boats assaulting fort, may hope approach undiscovered, coming suddenly pirates, brother still alive, may able rescue time revenge killing him." "I trust right, Mr Norman, poor fellow escaped, although pirates sent flag truce treat terms, I greatly fear kept hostage." While _Gnat_ sailed Captain Rogers made necessary arrangements attack. She, two largest boats, bombard fort, rest flotilla board junks, exception boats Mr Norman, land crews marines attack fort rear. Very little time longer elapsed _Gnat_, leading vessel, got within range junks, immediately began blaze away guns gingalls, she her smaller consorts returning fire interest. Two large junks lay directly way; one, first round fired, began settle rapidly many crew must sunk her, rest seen swimming like shoal tadpoles towards shore. The other, fine-looking vessel, stood longer. "Fire te deck, te deck!" cried Po-ho; "she ship; sink her!" A volley musketry made pirate crew quit vessel follow companions shore, _Round Moon_ remained floating tranquilly, although Captain Murray fully expected see her burst flames blow others done. Po-ho entreated he might go board prevent catastrophe; he allowed dingy couple men he might take possession his vessel. He might safer board _Gnat_, several shot fort struck junk man-of-war glided her shore. So close _Gnat_ get guns fort, trained high elevation, sent shot her; shells, round shot, rockets, she poured fort, apparently producing havoc among defenders. First one gun silenced, another, remainder continued blazing away, either gun-boat boats. The report Tom Rogers taken prisoner soon spread among boats _Empress_, boats ships, one exactly knowing happened. There search board junk captured, hopes discovering him, junk junk taken. Several, however, farther first attacked, slipped cables tried run shore; overtaken time so; others set fire pirates blew up, remainder succeeded effecting purpose. A good many prisoners, however, taken, either could swim time make escape. The British casualties small, two three junks showed fight. One largest fired away boats close her; she cut her cable made shore, still blazing away her heavy guns, gingalls, match-locks. Twice crew desert guns attempt leap overboard, restrained fine-looking fellow Malay dress, his sword kept men duty, cutting two three showed signs disobedience. Jerry Bird one boats _Empress_, catching sight pirate captain, he exclaimed, "Why, I am alive, that is friend Jonathan Jull! Hallo, Mr Jull, knock under; it is use holding out!" A fire-lock aimed Jerry's head answer made pirate chief. Fortunately bullet merely cut one his love-locks, junk, already close shore, stood on. In another minute she touched beach, Jull, firing last gun, set example deserting her, leaping overboard, began wade beach, surrounded his men, towards fort. The British boats followed them, got side junk exposed hot fire fort. This, however, stop them. On rushed, lieutenant leading them, hoping capture pirate chief, thus quickly put end contest. Jull, however, fast pair legs, he his men close gate, gun-boats ceased firing two rockets rose together, signal agreed show party shore attack fort. In mean time Captain Adair, marines, Lieutenant Norman, Desmond, Gordon, landed little sheltered bay, discovered near fort, pushed without perceived enemy. They advanced cautiously, feeling way, case ambush placed attempt destruction. All time continuous cannonade going sounded ears. Mr Norman told Captain Adair he seen number people escaping junks, well others outside fort, would, therefore, prudent prepared surprise. None, however, made. The pirates apparently assembled fort, determined hold last. They must seen, however, case desperate, junk junk taken destroyed, unless possessed abundance ammunition provisions must soon surrender. CHAPTER NINE. TOM IN THE HANDS OF THE PIRATES--ABOUT TO BE KILLED WHEN RESCUED BY JULL'S YOUNG WIFE--TOM WITNESSES THE FIGHT FROM THE ROCK--THE FORT TAKEN AND JULL KILLED--FUGITIVES BRING THE NEWS--THE YOUNG WIDOW'S PHILOSOPHY--SHE MAKES TOM AN OFFER, WHO SAYS HE MUST ASK HIS CAPTAIN-- TOM ESCORTS THE WIDOW ON BOARD THE GNAT--JACK FORBIDS THE BANNS--BOOTY REMOVED--THE WIDOW ENGAGED BY PO-HO--THE SQUADRON REACHES YOKOHAMA-- CURIOUS SIGHTS ON SHORE--EXPECTED ATTACK ON PRINCE SATSUMA--SQUADRON SAILS--THE PRINCE'S TOWN BOMBARDED AND HIS FLEET CAPTURED, PROCEEDINGS WHICH BRING HIM TO REASON AND ESTABLISH FRIENDLY RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES. We must return Tom Rogers. On finding hands pirates, he expected nothing instant death. His uniform, however, showed got hold officer, always eye business, probably considered might obtain high ransom him, hard pressed, he would prove valuable hostage hands, compel enemies come terms. On hearing shouts his companions rear, he made several desperate efforts escape, but, calmer reflection, sight sword-blade held level his throat made see wisdom desisting attempts. On dragged rear fort; already sight, party joined fugitives two junks destroyed. They came boiling rage defeat, seeing English officer power companions, instantly prepared kill him. A fierce-looking Malay, Tom guessed captain, drew his sword cut down, another party come fort, appeared scene. They escorting, seemed, young female place greater safety fort, which, although pirates might victorious, would knew exposed showers shot she will. Tom instantly recognised girl young Malay wife Jonathan Jull, guest board _Bellona_. As he desire die, he immediately shouted her, imploring her protection, letting her know he was. In another moment savage Malay would cloven his head two, Malay girl, answering his appeal, sprung forward placed herself front him, making violent gestures vociferating vehemently. What she saying Tom could guess at, although he supposed she insisting his life spared. "Thank you, thank you!" he said, taking her hand, putting his lips. "You saved life once, I best protect you, I get clear altogether." The effect Malay girl's speech appease savage old captain, length stalked away head his men towards fort, leaving Tom Malay girl party escorting her, men captured him. Still Tom felt his position insecure. At moment, pirates defeated, might, revenge, put death, even Jull lose his life, Tom thought his protectress might probably turn motive. He his best, however, ingratiate her. As time shot she will falling pretty thickly fort, former occasionally flying coming unpleasantly near guard attending Malay girl, hurried her on, taking Tom them. He willing enough go, he would avoid unnecessary danger he would otherwise run he carried fort. The guard consisted dozen men, sufficient number, however, prevent Tom making his escape. What intended ultimately he could ascertain, he felt tolerably safe Malay girl, already shown her willingness befriend him. He talked away her, although, he could speak word Malay Chinese, she understood small number English phrases, he found hard matter make understood. "How I prove gratitude?" he thought; he considered present he could make her. He felt his pockets; he could find Chinese coins, clasp knife, pencil-case--the latter merely plated, somewhat battered, valuable. He recollected gold seal attached his watch-chain. This he offered her, she smilingly put back showed variety gold ornaments, she produced bag her side;--how come by, Tom ask. Their conversation, was, interrupted increased roar guns, he guessed _Gnat_ boats hotly engaged fort fleet junks. Tom observed several men climbing top rock, whence he judged could see going forward. He naturally felt anxious same, made signs girl her permission. She nodded her consent, pirates made objection his joining them. As, however, watched fight saw junk junk blow up, others towed away boats, countenances assumed still deeper scowl usual, hands ominously clutched swords; still, make effort molest him, he permitted his guards remain he see fight. At length he observed large junk attacked boats, and, hot fight, run shore. Shortly afterwards he caught sight marines appearing shelter concealed them, and, party blue-jackets, making desperate assault rear fort towards right hand. Slight preparations made defence, scarcely minute elapsed he saw red-coats, flanked blue-jackets, climbing embankment, bounding like red blue balls parapet. At first pirates gave way, allowing entrance whole force, height he could clearly see going forward inside. Before victorious party got half-way across met band savage-looking fellows led big captain, quickly rallied fugitives. The pirate chief, Tom guessed he was, fought greatest desperation, he his men could long withstand points British bayonets, sharp edges cutlasses. Tom saw chief fall, dozen his men round him, rest giving way, made escape left gate, seen scampering away hot haste across country. Tom, he saw this, felt enviable position. The villains whose hands he fallen might revenge death companions murdering him, he maintained indifferent manner he could assume, he watched countenances surrounding him. He satisfaction observing instead thinking killing him, evidently much alarmed. They were, indeed, completely separated fugitive pirates, leave cover, would certainty discovered victors, possession fort, Tom knew seeing British flag run summit flag-staff fort. He somewhat anxious see effect would produce Malay girl rest party. Would one venture tell her her husband killed, he break intelligence her? She soon, however, apparently guessed exclamations pirates fort captured, might suspected hat her husband's fate. If case, appear great effect upon her. She sat fallen trunk tree rock, maintaining composure first. Tom began fear English would blow fort embark without coming look him. "Sooner I must try make run it," he said himself. "These fellows look cowed dare stop me. I must, however, first thank young lady saved life, she object keeping prisoner, I tell her boldly I intend doing, ask her assistance." Having formed resolution, he descended rock approached Malay girl. "Things appear gone friends," she observed. "It misfortune, cannot helped." "_Yes_, English possession fort, captured junks, I would advise friends yield prisoners, best way saving lives. I intercede them." "A good idea," remarked girl. "If go I accompany you." "I shall glad society," answered Tom; "but fellows do? They may try stop us." "I order remain English come make prisoners. Indeed, cannot get away without discovered, even wish it." Tom, highly delighted thus easily obtaining his liberty, agreed proposal. "Poor thing, she dreadfully cut she hears her husband's death!" he thought. As might dangerous remain longer, lest pirates change minds, Tom proposed set once, Malay girl agreeing, started together fort, none pirates attempting stop them. "I wonder whether I ought tell her her husband's death?" thought Tom; "but she hear soon enough get fort." While he discussing matter his mind, she turned said-- "They tell husband killed; true, I hope people take care me. He dreadful tyrant; now, lost his wealth, he would treated even worse before." This remark showed Tom his sympathy thrown away. The young lady greatly puzzled she proposed he marry her. He polite refuse once, remarked "that English midshipmen allowed wives board, he would think thing without asking his captain's leave." This appeared satisfy her, continued walking along side side amicably, till Tom heard voice exclaim, "Why, there is Tom Rogers, alive merry!" Immediately several his messmates rushed fort greet him. A party despatched make prisoners pirates hiding behind rock, shortly afterwards brought in. Preparations made destroying pirates' strong hold. The prisoners handcuffed carried board junks, guard placed them. The _Gnat_ meantime got her steam readiness tow captured junks. The Malay girl kept close Tom, evidently considering her protector, he, course, gratitude, could nothing less attend her, soon boat could obtained he took her _Gnat_. He explained her wishes Jack. "We must carry her Chusan, I dare say she find friends," said Jack; "but must let her understand I cannot give permission make her bride." The girl pouted she heard this, evidently philosophical turn mind, soon appeared reconciled her lot. A considerable amount booty found fort, valuable portion embarked captured junks. In mean time guns fort, several brass, considerable value, carried board gun-boat. Some powder landed placed advantageous positions blowing fort, train laid, soon party embarked, fired. The junks prisoners board taken tow _Gnat_, boats took charge rest junks. As flotilla moved off, fort blew loud explosion, fragments scattered far around. "I hope lesson given rascals teach future turn lawful occupations," observed Captain Rogers, he witnessed destruction fort. "They work weeks, cut junk, find fellow lead them," said Adair, remark made. "Altogether good morning's work, rendered service commerce putting stop present career desperadoes." The flotilla got clear passage, rejoined larger ships, which, taking junks tow, steamed back Chusan. Jack's chief puzzle know way dispose Malay girl; his anxiety removed Captain Po-ho, due form, offered marry her, arrangement she appeared objection. Jack events glad get her ship, as, say best her, she determined coquette, turned heads half midshipmen, and, whispered, one lieutenants, short time she board. The prisoners handed Chinese authorities, dealt according law. Some lost heads, others escaped, rest turned Chinese navy. The junks sold benefit captors, exception _Round Moon_, delivered back her cargo Captain Po-ho, who, considering he regained his vessel property, wife addition, benefited largely anybody else expedition. These arrangements made quickly possible, commodore continued his course. In week squadron came anchor lately built town Yokohama. It stands dead flat, formerly swamp, bluffs high land extremity, joined range low picturesquely wooded hills form horse shoe. Beyond hills, fifty miles away, rising height 14,000 feet sea, towers truncated cone Fasiama. At southern extremity seen long two-storied bungalow, serving British legation. Although time followers one principal damios wantonly murdered Englishman, people friendly foreigners, hesitate ride country. The three captains following day went shore see much could country curious inhabitants, fortunate individuals, three midshipmen, messmates, invited accompany them. The foreign settlement soon inspected, little see it, beyond bungalow-looking buildings gardens. They went adjoining Japanese town. It greatly resembled northern cities China, principal streets broad, neat clean-looking shops. These greatly resembled China, except Japanese used neither tables, chairs, counters. Those main street contained lacquer ware, carvings ivory, bronzes, beautiful porcelain, variety toys. Strange sights witnessed. Females exalted rank carried basket-like litter, sitting cramped uncomfortable posture. The basket, called "cango," suspended pole, borne shoulders two men. Ladies gentlemen higher rank seen going palanquins, smaller, used India. They formed wicker work, covered outside lacquer. They also supported poles shoulders bearers. None gentlemen, sat horses apparently wonderful dignity, really guided them, though held bridles hands--a groom always leading gaily-caparisoned steeds. The soldiers, however, troop always attendance "damio," great lord, course, managed horses themselves. The naval officers encountered party gentlemen, knowing importance avoiding dispute, managed good time get way. The "betos," horse-soldiers called, cast fierce glances strangers. Gerald, ever inclined merriment, could scarcely refrain laughing he watched passing by. "Well, fellows thinnest-clothed rascals I ever seen. Look, Tom, braided coats, fit tight skins. See curious devices them, back front. Look fellow big dragon--the head fore part his chest, body tail coming round his back, blue, red, yellow colours!" "Why, his skin thus tattoed curious fashion," answered Tom. "Not shred coat he got. See, every one device marked him, style uniform." "Take care, lads; do not speak loud; fellow see laughing talking them, may fancy insulting them, disagreeable consequences may ensue," cried Jack. The three captains accordingly turned horses' heads rode different direction damio his followers taken. On returning board, captains received summons admiral, desiring see important business. Having got full fig, required occasions, pulled away flag-ship. "There something wind, depend upon it!" observed one midshipmen Tom. "Did captain say anything you?" "I do not think he knows himself; he did, he would tell sooner anybody else," answered Tom. "I will tell I heard Captain Adair speaking about, I should not surprised meeting connected it." Most occupants midshipmen's birth assembled tea. "Well, Rogers, it?" exclaimed several voices. "Most us heard Prince Satsuma, mighty magnificent three-tailed Bashaw, chief lord owner city Kagosima adjacent parts. He, appears, one his bare-backed followers, time ago murdered, without rhyme reason, English merchant, happened riding along high road. Of course British Government demanded satisfaction: punishment murderer, good round sum compensation his bereaved family. These moderate terms prince does not seem inclined agree to, are, therefore, ordered impress necessity so, and, he not, batter his town, take possession his fleet--for said he got one--and make reprisals may deemed expedient bring reason. I heard captain say he paid visit one principal merchants residing here, transactions prince, Japanese official high rank place--I forget his name--and conversation matter dispute introduced. A Japanese speaks English well present act interpreter. The great aim official seemed induce British squadron go Kagosima, he entreated captain visit another official, prince's chief envoy. This, he said, could done without permission admiral, but, granted, he would willingly he requested. No sooner interpreter translated captain's reply great man, taking writing materials box, seated floor, began scribbling away scroll paper, wonderfully large characters, note envoy. As line line finished he rolled up, then, due formality, handed captain, curiosity measure it, think length? Why, six feet least. Official documents, rule, must thirty forty feet long, according importance." "Can tell us length lover's _billet-doux_?" asked assistant surgeon. "That depends much excess his ardour, he got say," answered Tom; "though, I have heard, I do not think Japanese addicted writing love-letters." "And happened next?" "That is I tell, though I believe letter delivered answered, hint Prince Satsuma whatever might said, he better look sharp yield demands, he might expect his town tumbling his ears. The British envoy admiral waiting reply, I suspect arrived satisfactory; consequently shall proceed immediately teach haughty damio Englishmen murdered impunity. These Japanese like Chinese taught better. They fancy castles impregnable, never attacked, except other, beat English squadron perfect ease." This information given Tom afforded intense satisfaction, hands waited considerable anxiety hear soon might expect exchange shots Japanese. They heard batteries likely engaged somewhat formidable character, already fired American French man-of-war inflicted considerable damage; American indeed, unsupported, narrowly escaped destruction. The captain, his return, brought intelligence confirmed hopes. The emperor had, however, sent document fifteen feet length, earnestly requesting expedition might put off; he gave guarantee satisfactory result would arrived at, British envoy kept his determination immediately enforcing demands his government. Early following morning, official gentlemen embarked board flag-ship, signal made squadron weigh, ships, steaming harbour, shaped course Bay Kagosima. The distance considerable, voyage occupied four days, preparations made expected attack capital Prince Satsuma. At last, wide entrance steamed beautiful Bay Kagosima, came anchor miles town, intending wait following morning. The midshipmen, might supposed, evening talked work expected engaged next day. Some thought land storm town, others admiral would content bombarding distance. "One thing I know work done brother Jack man go it," observed Tom Desmond. "We certain, therefore, see best part fun, whatever may be." "I do not think uncle Captain Adair far astern he chance," said Desmond, he properly always stuck his relative. One thing generally known, admiral orders bombard place burn Japanese accede unconditionally demands made them. The weather look promising could wished, still hopes entertained would allow ships take positions. At early hour next morning, signal made weighing, squadron steamed bay arrived town attacked, dropped anchor. It trifling work engage, could see long line fortifications extending across whole front city, flag Prince Satsuma flying one them. The guns, however, remained silent. "We shall soon knock place pieces," said Billy Blueblazes, he surveyed look contempt. "Do not sure that," answered Tom; "there pretty heavy guns inside forts, Japanese know handle too." Still guns open fire, short time boat seen putting shore. She contained party two-sworded officials, came board flag-ship, Captain Murray Archie happened time be. Archie afterwards related he saw heard. One principal two-sworded gentlemen inquired, air surprise, "why ships war come uninvited town?" adding he concluded ships brought letter British Government subject other. "You perfectly correct there," answer. "It letter, insisting demands made complied within twenty-four hours, not, see guns ships carry; shells rockets missiles warfare, shall compelled let fly pretty thickly ears." "But prince fifty miles off, impossible get answer within time specified." "Then make time thirty hours. Your posts perform distance time, take care dally way." The Japanese chief official smiled blandly, said would facilitate matters admiral _charge d'affaires_ would come shore discuss matter amicable manner within city, palace prepared reception. "The Japanese must think us green suppose us caught fashion," remarked one officers standing by, he heard interpreter give invitation. The Japanese official pressed offer bland courteous manner, pointing great advantage would gained quickly bringing affairs conclusion. The admiral, however, caught, he good reason congratulate he accept it, reported Japanese intended soon he envoy got inside castle lift drawbridges send word board squadron shot fired prisoners would instantly beheaded. The interview length came conclusion, two-sworded officials took departure shore. Within time specified returned long rigmarole letter, course anything satisfactory. They looked much surprised ordered return shore intimation communication would held prince unless flag truce. In mean time boat expedition ordered proceed gulf ascertain become fleet vessels prince said possess. Tom Desmond satisfaction going one boats, hopes raised work would cut them. The scenery presented either shore magnificent, weather continued fine. No ships were, however, seen got seven miles up, came sight three large steamers, flag prince flying board. It hoped would captured held pledge demands British complied with; officer command directed simply make reconnaissance, ordered boats put about, returned squadron. They found Japanese officials going backwards forwards, evidently intention, reason other, spinning time. That Japanese intended hostilities manifest enough, began assemble large bodies men batteries, point whole guns, numbering seventy eighty, upon squadron. Shortly this, five large junks warped inner harbour, anchored line fire. Later day, number Japanese boats came harbour, approached squadron, seen filled soldiers, although, time contained water melons, fowls, eggs, apparently intended represent provisions Japanese promised supply ships. Instead coming alongside, however, merely pulled round squadron, evidently purpose counting number guns, garrisons forts might satisfied far superior force possessed. The best scene all, however, visit damio, person high rank, came guard forty men. He impudence ask come board flag-ship his guard, and, perhaps greatly his surprise, granted, he looked much astonished he saw body marines drawn opposite side deck, seconds would sent his guard honour flying headlong water shown hostile intentions. Of two-sworded official evidently well aware, judging nervous expression his countenance. As soon he could find excuse so--glad enough get ship--he hurried away. Before he half-way companion ladder, admiral hoisted signal squadron get steam ready weigh anchor moment's notice. The reason his evident, seen Japanese training guns bear directly squadron, belief going remain were, shot at. The admiral issued another order, directing five smaller vessels squadron proceed gulf take possession three steamers discovered boats. "We shall fun now, events," exclaimed Tom Desmond, who, boat's crew, sent board one gun-boats short hands. "If fight run, shall amusement making chase. It better fun battering away walls, which, opinion, sort work affording little satisfaction one." The men-of-war, immediately getting way, proceeded gulf. They steamed full speed, soon came sight three Japanese steamers, which, however, showed inclination either fight run away. This somewhat disappointment. No sooner men-of-war approach, hauled flags tamely submitted carried off, brought to, range guns fort, crews persons found board taken them. "The admiral speaking us, sir," said Desmond, acting signal midshipman board _Empress_. Captain Rogers quickly turned leaves signal book. "Engage north battery, signal form line battle thrown out." Jack immediately gave order slip cable, steam got up, ship moved away towards spot she directed occupy, opening her fire without loss time battery, replied earnest, well-directed shots. Several struck her hull, others, flying her masts, cut away her rigging. This made her crew work greater zeal, hopes soon silencing battery. That, however, easily done, Japanese evidently handling guns well, driven them. Desmond kept his glass directed towards flag-ship, report signals might made. Tom attending his duty guns. Billy Blueblazes standing near Desmond, ready convey captain's orders. A shot passed unpleasantly near his head. "A miss good mile," remarked Desmond, Billy bobbed, looking rather pale. "I hope come nearer that," said Billy, recovering trying laugh. Just shot struck end Desmond's telescope, shattering pieces, carrying instrument his hands, fragment striking Billy cheek drawing blood, inflicting serious wound. The shot took head man moment coming aft, side deck. "Now, that is fair!" exclaimed Billy; "aiming purpose." "Then go get another spy-glass, afterwards ask doctor stick plaster cheek," said Desmond. "You will harm's way there, honour reported wounded, pleasanter list, though may tend much fame." Billy gladly hurried off, holding his handkerchief his face speedily returned telescope, Desmond, coolly before, continued watch mast-heads flag-ship. It warm work, already two men killed several wounded, including Billy, who, however, appeared deck large black patch his cheek handkerchief tied round his head, certainly improving his beauty. "Did get teeth knocked out?" asked Tom, Billy passed him. "If did, take care pick get doctor stick again, grow, depend that." "No, I lost teeth; I piece taken cheek," said Billy. "Lucky was not nose," observed Tom; "it would spoilt beauty ever." He could make remark, he attend his gun. Jack well performed duty entrusted him, expecting remain he battered fort, Desmond cried admiral making signals. They effect ships squadron get way form line battle town. Accordingly Jack, leaving sorely battered fort, steamed away take his position line. The weather, long threatening, came much worse crews stood ready guns. A heavy squall blew across gulf, instant downfall rain came on. Suddenly whole batteries opened squadron; still ships return fire. Immediately squall cleared away, signal seen flying flag-ship, directing prizes destroyed vessels charge join line battle. The flag-ship, leading, time, owing heavy gale blowing, exposed fire several batteries, killed two her officers wounded considerable number men. As soon weather would allow, ships got lost moment opening guns batteries. The ships long engaged, effects fire became visible battered state fort reduced, flames seen bursting different parts town. Every moment weather getting worse. The wind increased almost hurricane. The sky overcast dark gloomy clouds, rendering usually vivid flashes guns poured forth death-dealing shot town. At length became difficult work them, admiral gave signal discontinue action. Five large junks lay southward town, Japanese might hoped would escaped, mistaken supposing prince receive full punishment due him. These vessels his private property. The admiral ordered one smaller ships proceed immediately set fire junks, possibility carrying off. One quickly blazing up, flames, fanned rising gale, soon destroyed them. The steamer also threw her shells arsenal among number large storehouses, soon, sharing fate junks, left furiously blazing away. The squadron stood batteries returned former anchorage. Scarcely anchors hurricane came greater fury before. The night dark pitch, heavy thunder-clouds rolling overhead; wind land, though question whether might change, ships driven ashore, crews could expect little mercy hands Japanese. The _Empress_ one outermost squadron. It gone four bells first watch third lieutenant reported ship dragging her anchors. More cable veered out, she time exposed full blast gale. The lead hove, sixty fathoms reported; she could hold ground was, therefore, impossible. The captain ordered cable slipped, steam kept up, she drifted slowly away, still endeavouring regain her lost position. Every moment she became exposed force hurricane. All board well aware her danger, although she might bring opposite side bay; she would lee shore, her anchors hold, her loss almost inevitable, although hours might pass her fate sealed. All hands remained deck. Jack many dangerous position; days he wife care for, he responsibilities command. The night passed slowly away. When morning broke, gale continued blowing fiercely ever, land leeward looked unpleasantly near. Still steam kept up, trusty screw best drive gallant ship ahead. The instant hurricane moderated she began make way, soon got her anchorage rest squadron. Desmond turning his telescope towards shore, where, top hill overlooking anchorage, among grove thick trees, he saw number Japanese working away picks shovels, little he caught glimpse heavy gun, dragged number horses, coming along road, another another. It clear Japanese intended, advantageous position held, open fire smaller vessels lying within pistol-shot shore. The admiral, discovering this, ordered squadron weigh, his ship leading steamed channel line, passing batteries either side, saluted glided hot fire, bestowing particular attention palace prince, teaching lesson he likely soon forget. The batteries replied, feebly without damage one ships. The squadron returned anchorage taken first entering bay, crews plenty work repairing damages; fishing spars refitting proceeding sea. Returning Yokohama, satisfaction learning proceedings brought prince reason, whole sum demanded paid ample apologies offered. The undertaking, however, costly one. Two gallant officers eleven men killed forty-eight wounded. Friendly relations ultimately established Prince Satsuma, expressed his intention sending several his young nobility England educated, Tycoon despatched special envoy congratulate British _charge d'affaires_ satisfactory termination difficulties, express hope future amicable relations would exist two nations. CHAPTER TEN. THE EMPRESS SAILS FOR THE FIJI ISLANDS--PICKS UP TWO PAPUANS--CALLS OFF THE COAST OF NEW GUINEA--THE WRECK SEEN--TWO BOATS GO ON SHORE--WHAT HAVE BECOME OF THE CREW?--LIEUTENANT NORMAN ASCENDS A HILL--TOM DESMOND AND THEIR PARTY PUSH ON--THE LIEUTENANT ATTACKED BY THE NATIVES-- RETREATS--TOM AND DESMOND MISSING--AFTER A SEVERE FIGHT, REGAINS THE BOATS--CAPTAIN ROGERS LANDS, TO RECOVER HIS BROTHER AND HIS COMPANIONS-- UNSUCCESSFUL MARCH--NATIVE VILLAGE BURNT--BOATS SENT IN AGAIN--GALE COMES ON, AND THE SHIP STANDS OFF THE LAND--RETURNS--NO TRACES OF THE MIDSHIPMEN--CONTINUES HER VOYAGE--LONG STAY AT FIJI--EMPRESS AND ORION SAIL FOR SYDNEY--A WRECK SEEN. The Japanese difficulty satisfactorily settled, ships squadron separated proceed various destinations. The _Empress_, lying Victoria Harbour, received orders proceed Fiji Islands, directions touch her way northern coast New Guinea search crew merchant vessel said lost thereabouts. Captain Rogers afterwards visit Sydney Australian ports returning home. All hands well pleased thoughts number places visit, curious people see. The _Empress_ sea. Passing north Philippine Islands Pacific, she steered southward she sighted Pelew Islands, eight degrees north equator. As surrounded reef, she stand close in. Several well-built canoes, however, came off, manned dark-skinned race inhabit group. They brought tropical fruits vegetables, appeared eager trade. Hills covered trees, fruitful valleys streams trickling them, could seen. The distance shore, however, great allow landing made, intercourse opened people. The natives, disposed cargoes canoes, return, another canoe came off, board two black men frizzly heads hair, evidently Pelew Islanders. Having come board, made signs wished go country southward. The captain placed chart them, pointing islands ship was. After regarding time, one drew his finger along chart reached coast New Guinea. On picture group Papuans exhibited he seemed recognise it; indeed, looking his features picture, Jack convinced his two visitors Papuans. One Papuans, board whaler months could speak little English, confirmed this. Jack accordingly, without hesitation, undertook carry men native land. Their names, informed Pat Casey, took managed means understand said, Nicho Picho, forthwith dubbed Nick Pipes. Nick curious-looking little fellow, scarcely four feet high, broad shoulders, strong Hercules, his face hideous could well imagined. Pipes taller foot more, intelligent desperately ill-looking his companion, though far beauty. They rapidly acquired knowledge English, Pat took great pains teach them. They evidently accustomed ship, he discovered brought native land whaler, board picked knowledge language. Captain Rogers hoped would make useful communicating countrymen. He would indeed gladly board weeks, order might express better did. However, Pat understood them, Tom Gerald, constantly talking men. The ship continued her course sail order spare coals, wind light she made little way. At length, however, coast New Guinea sighted, ranges lofty mountains appearing distance, ground base level character, thickly covered trees water's edge. The ship stood along coast, sending her boats frequently shore, nothing wreck seen, could Nick Pipes manage communicate countrymen, described "bad mans," made gestures significant knocking head intruders. Captain Rogers began fear fate crew _Fair Imogene_, vessel search. The ship occasionally came anchor, two Papuans invariably gave character inhabitants. She running along one afternoon light breeze easy sail, lead going, fires banked ready get steam necessary, master, standing bridge, his glass turned towards coast, exclaimed-- "I see wreck close shore, though her masts gone; that is ship's hull, I am Dutchman." Several glasses pointed direction, came conclusion master right. The ship accordingly hove her head shore, two boats sent in, second lieutenant going one command expedition, Billy Blueblazes him, Tom charge Desmond, Pat Casey, Peter black, Nick Pipes. The sea perfectly smooth, able get alongside wreck. A cursory examination left doubt she vessel search. She fearfully battered condition. Her after-cabin knocked pieces, whole her cargo washed her; still possible her crew might escaped shore, destroyed natives. Pipes asserted "good mans," Nick evidently doubtful matter. On reaching beach party boats landed without difficulty, two men left charge each, rest proceeded search signs _Fair Imogene's_ crew. Mr Norman said he thought might probably built hut shore part wreck, erected flag-staff make signals passing vessel. Not far stream fresh water, would enabled remain spot. Birds innumerable, gay plumage, traces four-footed animals, showed could want food. A search hour half more, however, convinced Mr Norman crew landed there, must soon taken departure, either inland along coast, slightest sign could found. The next thing discover natives try open communication. Not far right rocky hill partly covered trees. Mr Norman, taking two his men him, climbed top, hoping thence able obtain good view country, ascertain human habitation existed neighbourhood. Tom Gerald, party, accompanied natives, had, perhaps imprudently, pushed inland, intending return meet lieutenant, neglected give directions remain stationary he come hill. This considerably higher he supposed, occupied much longer time he expected gaining summit. He obtained, however, much extensive view he thought possible. Although shore fringed trees, made appear whole country covered them, plantations open grassy spaces, also numerous huts, built apparently like Malays, piles. He time noting various objects, he caught sight hill, westward, considerable body men, armed muskets, others bows, spears, swords. As making directly hill, he little doubt he observed; might cut his companions rest party, he considered prudent instantly descend. Just he got bottom, he caught sight trees body natives advancing towards him. "Where Mr Rogers his men?" he inquired. "They went direction," answer. "It possible, sir, got back boats way," said Bird. "We fancied caught sight trees distance." Mr Norman, however, satisfied case, lead forward his men direction Tom, Desmond, his companions taken, natives considerable numbers spread front him, evidently intending dispute his advance. As captain given strict orders account show hostility inhabitants, he considered his duty halt make signs friendship. This, however, produced effect natives. Had either Nick Pipes he might opened communication, gone Tom Rogers, he means making natives understand he wished friendly terms them. They soon showed hostility firing several shots. The lieutenant, therefore, felt his duty call his men together retreat order boats, hoping find Tom his party already reached them. As soon began retreat enemy pressed on. He gave order fire return, sooner seamen lift muskets shoulders natives got cover, although shot must passed close them, one apparently hurt. As others seen coming up, Mr Norman continued retreat. The enemy grew bolder, showers arrows fell around seamen, addition bullets whistled past ears. The moment halted fire, natives dodged behind trees, though altogether escape, two three seen fall. The enemy, increasing numbers, rushed boldly on, stopped sailors turned round fire them. Mr Norman wounded arm bullet, arrow struck side. Calling his men halt fire, he succeeded pulling continued retire. Four his men shortly afterwards wounded, either bullets arrows, happily yet none fallen. At length he could see boats distance. He hoped Tom Rogers his men would come his assistance, he looked vain. Except two men boats, must heard firing standing muskets ready service, one seen. His great object prevent enemy getting water. Continuing his retreat, he ordered his men reload fire rapidly could, push boats. From courage hostility people, he doubted much Papuans, convinced Malays taken possession part country. One thing certain, must constant intercourse white men obtained large supply firearms powder. Not seeing Tom Desmond, men accompanied them, he began fear must cut another party natives. He determined, however, reaching boats, enemy advance, shove distance, await possible reappearance midshipmen, or, return, go ship reinforcements, escaped lives, endeavour rescue them. It serious question, however, whether he succeed reaching boats. He called his men fight last, sell lives dearly. A hearty cheer reply, seamen fired well-directed volley, knocked several enemies; could reload, natives upon them, hand-to-hand fight ensued. Animated voice officer, got bayonets fixed charged enemy. Two poor fellows dropped, shot heart. Besides already wounded, another close Mr Norman his brains knocked out. The survivors making desperate effort, finally succeeded reaching boats. Scarcely, however, got board enemy regaining courage rushed upon them, without severe struggle manage shove off, many wounded greatest difficulty could man oars. Scarcely Mr Norman taken his seat stern sheets he sank fainting. He recovered somewhat boats got beyond reach shot shore; although he wished put wounded men care surgeon, he felt great unwillingness pull without ascertained fate midshipmen. "Did one see them?" he asked. "No, sir," answered Jerry Bird mournful tone. "Not glimpse them. I listening case fire, I heard shot direction I have idea took." "Give way, then, lads," said lieutenant, putting boat's head round; following his example, pulled back ship. The sound firing heard, captain ordered three boats got ready, party marines blue-jackets well armed go help shipmates, boats seen coming off. As supposed returned them, order countermanded. On hearing Mr Norman occurred, boats immediately ordered off, captain taking command, third lieutenant senior mate charge boats, two three midshipmen master's assistants, eager recover lost messmates. No one would believe actually cut off, fully expected find either defending strong position, beach, cut way enemies. The boats drew near shore, natives seen, missing party. On landing, Jack ordered marines form, threw skirmishers front either side, feel way, fully expecting every moment come sight large body natives. Still went, one appeared. On getting foot knoll Lieutenant Norman obtained view country round, captain party men climbed summit. Not native seen. In vain Jack turned his glass every direction, hoping see his brother's party. No human visible, even among huts distance Lieutenant Norman discovered. To sure, might natives close them, yet concealed dense growth trees. Jerry Bird, returned captain's boat, anxious one recover young officers, expressed his opinion gone southward south-west, Jack resolved make his way direction, hopes coming upon "trail," expression North America. Desirous he recovering lost ones, he forget his duty his ship. He felt he must run risk drawn trap surrounded superior force enemy, incumbent return boats nightfall. The party could advance slowly thick brushwood, many places hew away cutlasses, every instant expecting see enemy start them. There traces blood ground bushes, showing natives fallen bullets fired Mr Norman's party, bodies killed carried off. Indeed, savage Papuans appeared be, apparently considered "discretion best part valour," seeing superior force landing, beat retreat inland fastnesses. Jack began feel sick heart hour hour went by, several miles ground passed over, without traces Tom his companions discovered. The heat intense, men began show signs fatigue, though endeavoured keep well could. Jack, finding tolerably open space rivulet fresh water running it, called halt. He considered risk surprise, placing men watch, would time stand defensive attacked. The rest, food fresh water, restored men, eager push forward. The "bush" front becoming thicker ever; work way well it, might find difficult matter get again. He accordingly ordered fire muskets give good hearty British cheer, missing party anywhere neighbourhood might hear it. They waited silence; reply came. Jack looked his watch. There would barely time reach boats dark, enemy get shore, would cut way them. With heavy heart captain last gave order retire. "What! going without punishing rascals opposition shown us?" Jack overheard one officers remark. "They consider gained day, behave fashion may pay another visit." Jack's thoughts completely engaged Tom midshipmen necessity inflicting punishment natives occurred him. Perhaps, all, friends killed, might carried prisoners village he seen height. He accordingly directed his march towards it, country pretty open direction, party made good progress. The huts reached; considerable size, raised ground piles, constructed chiefly bamboos thatched palm leaves. The first entered deserted. They went house house. Not human found, even old people children removed. As means punishing people uninvited attack made boats' crews, Jack ordered whole village given flames. By igniting handfuls dried leaves thrown houses, quickly blazed one end other. They left burning furiously even inhabitants return, could possibly extinguish fire. Even necessary act induce enemy come hiding-places, appear even distance party marched back boats. It bitter disappointment recovered midshipmen companions, while, got hold natives, impossible ascertain fate. Night approaching. Jack felt his duty return ship, he resolved leaving one boats Mr Hanson, third lieutenant, volunteered remain. He keep close shore, prepared shove moment, he attacked superior force enemy. Much regret expressed captain returned board, Tom his companions recovered. The ship remained hove night, many hoped believed boat would return missing ones morning. When morning came, however, boat appeared. Jack accordingly pulled two boats, intending relieve Lieutenant Hanson. The latter seen coming meet them. He remained his post, he said, night, although he attacked, he heard natives shouting occasionally firing muskets, even midshipmen attempted so, could succeeded making way beach without fighting. Jack, unwilling give hope getting Tom back, landed his whole force marched inland, but, preceding day, enemy retreated hid themselves, evidently conscious unable cope strong party. The difficult nature country rendered impossible advance done previous day, Captain Rogers compelled return boats, without effected anything. He left another boat Mr Tomkinson, senior mate, directions he given lieutenant. In addition, however, he instructed natives approach, possible get hold one them, charging account fire, unless attacked. Once boats pulled back ship. On getting board, Jack, finding barometer falling slightly, though sky looked serene ever, considered prudent get better offing previous night, intending stand back morning pick Mr Tomkinson's boat. He talked his first lieutenant possibility penetrating country larger number men he landed. Much would depend state weather; continue calm larger boats might go guns bows, securely hold beach number inhabitants might appear, party landing might advance considerable distance without fear attacked rear. Their plans were, however, defeated. As night drew weather began sensibly change, fears began entertained Mr Tomkinson's boat would succeed regaining ship. Should expected gale blow shore, would necessary ship gain good offing soon possible. Steam got up, her head put towards shore; she slowly made her way back, close possible, expectation Mr Tomkinson would, seeing change weather, pull meet her. The lead kept going, she might run risk getting shallow water. Just daylight captain ordered gun fired, another shortly afterwards, Mr Tomkinson would, course, understand signal recall. When length gloom night cleared away, boat seen pulling fast crew could lay backs oars. The ship's head, meantime, put round, would dangerous her approach nearer. Mr Tomkinson reported, Mr Hanson done, natives continued making noise whole night firing, carefully kept way, he unable catch hold them. Scarcely boat hoisted up, heavy squall struck ship, became necessary put steam enable her obtain sufficient offing land. As wind continued get sea increase, hopes communicating shore days come, abandoned. Jack still would believe his midshipmen killed, though generally supposed board fate. The surgeon, Dr McGauley, however, inclined hold captain. "Dinna fash yourself, Captain Rogers," he observed, "midshipmen nine lives, like cats, hard three together do not manage get clear savages, although, addicted cannibalism, master Billy run good chance eaten." "It said, however, Papuans cannibals, fellows encountered certainly sort savages I supposed meet. My hope either made prisoners midshipmen men, people managed escape southward, perhaps may pick along coast," observed captain. There was, however, abatement gale; contrary, become perfect hurricane, reefs abound along coast New Guinea, necessary safety ship stand sea. For nearly ten days bad weather continued, upwards two weeks elapsed _Empress_ could get back coast. Boats sent shore before, natives took good care appear. The ship slowly steamed southward, firing guns making signals, and, whenever possible, sending boats two three occasions natives seen, without interpreter found impossible hold intercourse them. At length Jack reluctantly compelled give hope recovering his midshipmen men them. He felt bound continue his voyage visit islands he directed call, going Fiji. Several places touched New Ireland, Solomon Islands, Santa Cruz New Hebrides. One duties Captain Rogers perform overhaul vessels suspected unlawfully islanders board purpose taking work Queensland Fiji. Several met with, papers regular passengers appeared willingly board; time, one interpret them, latter point remained doubtful. The _Empress_ continued her voyage, touching numerous places, she reached Fiji group, since passed possession England. Here she fell _Orion_, commanded Captain Adair; two old friends, spending time visiting various chiefs, sailed Sydney, ultimate destination. A visit paid Noumea, French settlement New Caledonia, ships also touched Norfolk Island, longer convict establishment, habitation Pitcairn Islanders, head-quarters Melanesian mission. The ships sea five days leaving Norfolk Island, sail, look-out mast-head _Empress_ announced he saw looked like dead whale away starboard bow. "A whale float high water that," remarked Mr Hanson, went rigging his glass. "That is vessel sort, good large one, her beam ends. Possibly her crew may escaped, clinging her." On returning deck he made his report, captain ordering yards braced up, ship stood direction wreck. CHAPTER ELEVEN. TOM AND DESMOND WITH THEIR PARTY RETREAT INTO THE INTERIOR--NICK SETS OUT TO SCOUT--RETURNS--TOM GOES OUT AND BRINGS UNSATISFACTORY INTELLIGENCE--THE PARTY REACH THE RIVER--EMBARK IN A CANOE--PURSUED-- ESCAPE UP THE RIVER--MOOR TO A TREE FOR THE NIGHT--A PLENTIFUL BREAKFAST--THROUGH A FOREST--TOM AND PIPES VISIT THE SHORE--SEE THE SHIP SAIL--A STORM--RETURN TO THEIR COMPANIONS--COMMENCE JOURNEY TO THE SOUTHWARD--ESCAPE OBSERVATION OF NATIVES--NUMEROUS DANGERS--PETER SEIZED BY A TIGER--BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS--BIRDS OF GAY PLUMAGE SHOT--BILLY NARROWLY ESCAPES FROM A CROCODILE--ATTACKED BY MONKEYS--CROSS A WIDE PRAIRIE-- WANT OF WATER--FIND WATER-MELONS--BUFFALOES KILLED--SIGHT A SNOWY MOUNTAIN--DEER KILLED, AND A FIGHT WITH A TIGER--CROSSING THE MOUNTAINS--SEE A VOLCANO--AN ERUPTION--SERPENTS--A LARGE LAKE--A FRIENDLY CHIEF--JOURNEY CONTINUED--THE COAST REACHED--AN ENGLISH BRIG IN THE HARBOUR. The party consisting Tom Rogers, Gerald Desmond, Billy Blueblazes, Casey, Peter, two Papuans, Nick Pipes, penetrated considerable distance south-west, heard sound hot firing rear. The midshipmen proposed returning rejoin friends, Pipes, great alarm, pointed probability Papuans got English, would certainty, case, attacked killed could regain beach. Nick joined his entreaties his countryman, offered steal forward ascertain position two parties, begging his friends remain concealed behind rocks thick bushes his return. The sound firing continued. From nature volleys evident two parties engaged, Papuans must possess considerable number muskets. Tom, therefore, thought prudent agree Nick's proposal. He his companions accordingly concealed spot proposed, Nick hurried forward direction firing. Tom Desmond considered must first supposed. As Nick re-appear, last began fear he caught enemy, perhaps deserted them. They suggested Pipes, replied, "No, no; he good man; come back!" "I wish run it, tried reach shore," said Desmond. "We might knocked head made attempt," answered Tom; "but discovered enemy sell lives dearly, get possession one rocks near us hold ammunition expended." "Oh dear? dreadful!" exclaimed Billy. "I am thankful say, however, I brought away powder flask quite full, ammunition pouch, may hold hours; I hope time friends come rescue." They waited nearly hour longer. Again came sound even sharper firing before, though seemed off. Pipes crept his hiding-place ascertain one approaching, proceeding, case, would likely betrayed him. "Here come Nick! Him sure!" exclaimed Pipes last. "I hope is," said Tom. "But silence, you, case prove enemy might betray hiding-place." It Nick, however. He looked much alarmed. His report, far could understood, Papuans, collected villages, taken positions little distance coast, whence could watch proceedings white men, would impossible get shore without discovered. Tom Desmond, this, proposed fighting way through. Casey Peter ready enough so, anything else wished; Nick Pipes objected strongly proceeding, affirming discovered shot make attempt. "Wait; by-and-by mans go away!" said Pipes. Tom, satisfied this, determined go scout himself. Desmond Billy wanted go him. "One enough run risk," he answered. "Two likely observed. I go far, keep well cover." Desmond Billy felt anxious Tom away, lest he fall hands Papuans. "If get cut his head," said Billy, "and shall never see again." "Tom knows he about; unless enemy suspect rear, looking about, much risk his discovered," answered Desmond. "It would better sent one black fellows," observed Billy. "I say, Desmond, grub? I am getting sharp set, spite feelings." "I suspect shall get nothing to-night," answered Desmond. "If fire betray ourselves, enemy upon us. Perhaps Tom report moved away, shall able reach beach. Lieutenant Norman sure go away without us." "But he will not stop he fancies killed; his opinion, depend upon it," said Billy, melancholy tone. "Hark! I hear one coming," said Desmond. "Keep quiet!" It proved Tom, looked unusually grave. "I considerable distance," he said, "and sharp run keep ahead enemy. They coming way, I question whether prove secure hiding-place; for, I watched them, seemed stowing away trees behind hillocks rocks, sure pop here." Nick Pipes appeared quickly understand he saying. "Den go higher," said Nick, pointing towards bank river. It occurred Tom Papuan expected find canoe might escape river get sea. He accordingly without hesitation followed Nick's advice; party set out, following two Papuans fast could run, hoping avoid seen enemy. Instead, however, keeping stream, Tom expected would do, proceeded it. "I suppose think shall find canoe direction likely below," said Tom Desmond, "but will not turn back." They continued along bank direction guides led them, thus getting coast. They gone way Tom asked Nick whether he sure find canoe. "Yes, yes, sure," answer. "We shall soon get back current," observed Desmond. "It will not make much difference, indeed sufficient wait dark, shall run little risk seen." The two Papuans still positive long would find canoe. Casey opinion, although he grounded it, difficult say. When stopped could hear enemy shouting shrieking behind them, convinced would safer go turn back. At last, run several miles along banks river, caught sight five canoes hauled shore, far several huts. None inhabitants visible; perhaps gone defend shores expected invasion white men. "Hurrah! right now!" cried Desmond. "We take best canoe, might prudent smash others prevent enemy giving chase us." "Let us get water first, see afterwards," said Tom, looking paddles. He found enough his party, couple besides, carried off. It took little time launch canoe, somewhat heavy drawn distance water. Tom seated aft steer. Desmond Billy sat next him, Casey Peter next, two Papuans bows use two foremost paddles. Pipes still shore prepared shove bow canoe he stepped board, pointing eastward, he exclaimed "Here come!" The midshipmen, looking direction, saw large body men approaching. "Jump in, Pipes, jump in!" exclaimed Tom. "We must get stream enemy reach banks, may peppering us warmly may find pleasant." Tom turn head canoe direction, Desmond exclaimed-- "Look there, look there! fellows about?" Three canoes full men seen darting behind thick bushes another small river observed. They would effectually prevent escape midshipmen's canoe. "We shall desperate fight fellows before: get river," cried Desmond, "and assistance friends shore." While Desmond speaking Tom considering best done, several men flourishing paddles hands seen rush huts. "Dat way, dat way!" exclaimed Nick Pipes time, pointing river. The sun time point setting, Tom considered could keep ahead enemies darkness set in, might either find place concealment, paddle silently night escape observation. There time consider plan proposed; must either follow once, prepare desperate encounter. "It thing done," observed Desmond; Tom, turning head canoe river, told his crew paddle away lives. They scarcely got good way canoe, men village began launch theirs. More natives appeared, two three minutes whole native fleet water. "They do not appear firearms, got bows arrows," said Tom, looking astern. "If good English boat, whole fleet make us fly, might quickly capsize canoe us power. I fear arms. Paddle, paddle, lads!" he shouted. His crew paddle, probably harder ever done lives. Poor Billy exerted he red face, "puffing blowing," Desmond declared, "like grampus;" spite danger in, he amused quizzing his companion. "We gaining events," said Tom. "If encounter higher river, shall distance time dark, shall good chance getting clear." The river continued broad, current strong, canoe made good headway. They kept centre, run risk attacked natives shore. Here among trees huts seen, inhabitants either perceive supposed Papuans, although saw several canoes drawn banks, attempt made launch them. Thus went without relaxing efforts instant sunset, shades night quickly crept scene. Tom felt unwilling go coast, proposed looking creek bay, shaded trees, could remain concealed enemies likely longer watching river, might steal unobserved. No spot, however, could discover, last wearied exertions stopped paddling, heard shrieks pursuers distance. "They given chase yet," observed Desmond. "The fact following us shows fear may escape way. Perhaps may find branch another outlet sea." "Oh, let us paddle on," cried Billy. "I do not like thoughts caught eaten savages." "Whether eat men not, knock us head, come much thing," said Casey; "so better keep ahead give chase, likely, do not find us, fancy landed, turn back come from." The paddles accordingly plied much vigour before. Tom pocket compass, dark see it; he however judged stars overhead river running southward, he hoped, landing right bank, able strike eastward across country regain sea-shore. Had he known nature task, he would considered undertaking far difficult he supposed be. In vain he his companions looked another branch river might descend. No opening appeared either one side other. After paddling another hour, stopped. At first sounds heard except cries night birds strange shrieks animals forest. "We might pull one bank other, rest time slip again," observed Desmond. They point proposed, sound natives' voices heard coming stream. The enemy probably time joined canoes seen banks, Tom confessed he considered risk attempting escape way come great. The thing could therefore keep Tom Desmond good reason believe completely distanced pursuers, soon daylight might hope strike across country regain coast, sure boats would look-out them. For time seen lights banks indications country inhabited, got river less risk discovered. They correctly calculated distance gone. There time little current them, discovered paddling on. The tide setting river, thus sent much faster supposed. Nick Pipes urged continue course. "All right; get away!" cried Nick. "No fear," cried Pipes. "Paddle, boys, paddle!" Thus hour hour paddled on, Tom declared would folly go further, must either land else secure canoe trunk tree wait her daylight. The latter plan adopted. Steering right bank, thick branches overhung stream, secured canoe stem small tree. "We must keep watch," said Tom, "or may receive visit wild beast, found napping natives, made prisoners killed without opportunity defending ourselves." Gerald agreed keep first watch couple hours, call Tom. "I wish something eat," said Billy. "I shall grow thin whipping-post, never able march way coast, must far off, I suspect." "Never fear, Billy; better get sleep, forget matter. In morning shall probably able kill birds, find wild fruit," answered Tom. Billy, groan, lay bottom canoe, rest party stretched well could, although much room legs. Desmond sat his musket his hands, keeping eye river, occasionally peering among trees shore. Mournful sounds ever anon came forest, he could detect human voices; he therefore hoped enemy given pursuit. He hard matter keep awake, murmur water, passed by, tending much lull sleep. He contrived, however, keep his eyes open. He knew region disagreeable creatures existed anacondas, tigers, huge baboons, alligators, one might suddenly make appearance. He stood his watch, near he could calculate, couple hours, feeling that, notwithstanding danger apprehended, he could hold much longer, he roused Tom, who, his two hours' sound sleep, soon wide awake. "I thinking sorts horrible creatures may chance neighbourhood. Take care let get hold us," said Gerald. "No fear that," answered Tom, taking Gerald's musket; "I try give good account beast comes near us." Tom sat, Desmond done, his rifle ready immediate action. It hitherto dark look his watch, he thought imprudent strike light purpose. He had, therefore, notion time went by. Greatly his surprise he shortly saw streaks dawn sky, ere long rich glow, heralding rising sun, appeared eastward, shedding ruddy tint calm surface river. He decide next done. To attempt descend river daytime would expose certain capture. He anxious try reach coast early possible. Taking his compass, he ascertained lay due east, course river south-west north-east; far shore difficult say. Nick Pipes evidently like thoughts proceed direction, and, pointing towards south, said native village situated. "We must go coast, events," said Tom. "If desert us cannot help it." "Since matter settled, let us breakfast," exclaimed Billy. "I wish would knock birds. There plenty them. Here small shot. I thought would useful." There parrots, paraquets, doves, several birds exquisite plumage, flying about; Tom, good shot, even ship's musket, minutes shot many would serve party breakfast. The men set work pluck them, caring little fine feathers. An open space, could venture light fire, soon found. Nick Pipes mean time hunting wild fruit, quickly brought good supply. "There is fear starving country; that is one comfort," observed Billy, he began munch away his share parrot. The fruits refreshing. They ate without fear, although know names, Nick Pipes assured good. The meal over, party prepared set out. They first, however, drew canoe, concealed closely possible bushes, might make use necessary. Nick Pipes, understood Tom required, offered go front scout, gave understand fall enemy would retreat, he must prepared halt turn back again, might deem necessary. They soon found dense forest, hard matter make way. Wherever open space ground covered profusion flowers; birds gay plumage flew amid trees, monkeys various sizes leaped branch branch. Occasionally make way cutlasses, somewhat slow business, fatiguing bargain. In many places Nick Pipes able get were, also constantly afraid might come suddenly upon natives betray themselves. At last, coming brook, sheer fatigue compelled halt eat remainder provisions cooked morning. After resting pushed on, progress rapid first. Towards evening Tom, hopes getting sight ocean, climbed tree taller fellows. Having his spy-glass, he could see great distance. "How far it?" inquired Desmond, Tom came down. "Shall get to-night?" asked Billy. "Not week make better way done morning," answered Tom. "I could make sea distance, I fancied huts plantations us shore. We must try pass without discovered inhabitants." The heat excessive, midshipmen glad rest following morning. During night utterly impossible make way wood. As huts seen near, ventured light fire, watching carefully spread, when, Billy observed, provisions would much overdone. After camping, first thing look food. The parrots, reason other, rather shy, troop inquisitive monkeys came near ascertain strangers about. Pipes, accompanied Tom, urged shoot. "Him good, good," he said. Tom course heard creatures eaten, although he never tasted monkey. He accordingly fired, brought two sitting together grinning him. The rest came chattering screeching boughs close his head, began throw sticks nuts, latter eating, spit furious fashion. "Kill more, kill more!" cried Pipes. Tom fired, two others fell ground, remainder ran shrieking away forest. Pipes, taking possession game, marched back camp well-satisfied air. "You mean say feed creatures?" exclaimed Desmond. "I cannot shoot anything else, better eat starve," answered Tom. "Ah! let us try them," cried Billy. "Anything better empty stomach." By time monkeys cooked appetites party considerably increased. Although midshipmen made wry faces first, mouthfuls went eating monkey accustomed lives. Nick Pipes advised keep fire night, otherwise might find somebody carried huge species tiger said infested woods forests country. Their advice followed, hands took turns remain watch. Billy called his companions twice, declaring he saw head huge tiger peering bushes, he fire, he afraid missing. Though Desmond grumbled roused up, proved Billy right marks tiger left ground. They got far next day scouts came back urged proceed. As reaching shore without discovered, said impossible, country thickly inhabited open, chance pass night. Should advance much would run great risk seen. After searching Pipes his companion discovered good hiding-place, similar one concealed themselves. Towards night could tell, soughing wind trees appearance sky, change weather. "I sure boats will not leave us chance," observed Tom. "I make way alone, help Pipes, see become them. If I come back know I caught, I would advise try get southward, may perhaps find inhabitants friendly, able get across Australia." Desmond begged Tom let go instead; Tom made his mind undertake excursion, soon dark he set Pipes, agreed go, although he evidently like work. Tom his faithful attendant set off. They long distance go, detours make. Occasionally heard dogs bark, saw lights windows huts; kept clear them, made good progress. They one two narrow escapes; one occasion tumbled water-course. They, however, scrambled again, inconvenience wetting, which, considering warmth weather, great consequence, even Tom; Pipes rub his hand, he dry minutes. It nearly daylight, however, beach reached, hunted found shelter rocks, would prevent seen people shore. Here waited daylight, Tom eagerly looked ship. "There she is!" he cried out, gloom night clearing away he saw her standing towards land, though distance northward he was. Presently gun fired, followed shortly afterwards another. He set try make his way along beach, feeling sure guns fired signals crew shore, he saw his telescope boat pull behind point make her way towards ship, time swept round her head shore. He means making signal. Even he fire his rifle, would heard. To shout would avail. He watched boat she alongside, she hoisted ship steamed away. It high time she get shore, heavy gale sprung up, sending heavy breakers fury rock-bound coast. "There chance getting continues," said Tom himself; "we left resources, I see that. The best thing would start southward, Pipes recommends." Tom eager return consult Desmond, Pipes earnestly entreated remain concealed day, night would little difficulty making way back companions. It melancholy day, he sat sea-shore rocks, watching departing ship. A she will-fish food he Pipes could procure. As soon night came inhabitants returned huts, he his faithful companion set out. As storm howling making tremendous noise, little danger discovered. Desmond Billy become anxious thankful see them, although Billy uttered deep groan he heard ship sailed away, he would hundreds miles trudge country. None indeed knew undertake, and, exception Billy, looked upon journey pleasant excursion. As Tom plenty time rest previous day, he ready set early morning. Guided Tom's pocket compass, steered westward south, direction Nick Pipes wished take. The two Papuans explained would go way reach river, advised keep direction pursuing. During day travelled without stopping, anxious get away sea-board. It evidently thickly populated part country, while, judging seen, inhabitants interior. In afternoon, moving on, Pipes, scouting front, came back made sign get cover bushes, he pointed close hand. Scarcely crouched down, heard voices party natives passed close without discovering them. Further came upon plantation, number women working it. By turning aside time, escaped observation. They were, however, afraid lighting fire night, lest might betray whereabouts natives. They had, fortunately, preserved cooked meat starting, enough supper, help fruit. Tom urged hands, man his turn, keep strict watch; fire would great risk attacked wild beasts. All promised obey his injunctions. Tom intended take first watch, Casey next, Desmond third, Billy--who, hoped, good sleep, would keep awake--the fourth. The three first carefully kept watches, moving round round sleeping companions, savage beast could approach unperceived. Desmond, however, fancied he saw object moving amid trees gloom. At last he called Billy, charged keep bright look-out. "If do not, depend upon us carried one beasts tigers," he said, much emphasis. "I felt uncomfortable long time I time I watch." Billy promised remain broad awake keep his weather eye open. "Mind do!" said Desmond, he lay down. The whole camp awakened fearful shriek loud cry Billy, starting feet, saw light day, broken, huge animal carrying Peter, black, jaws, Billy lay sprawling ground he fallen, his foot caught supple jack, he making chase depredator. The whole party followed, tiger, tiger was, quickly bounded sight. Tom midshipmen sincere regard honest Peter, grieved think lost him. Rushing on, caught sight Peter monster's jaws. But black inactive, seized left shoulder, his right hand, free, he punching tiger furiously eyes. Tom afraid firing, lest he hit Peter; time seemed scarcely possible poor fellow would escape torn pieces. Suddenly, however, tiger gave spring forward, midshipmen saw Peter longer creature's mouth. Tom Desmond fired together, tiger bounded away. On getting up, surprise find Peter rising his feet, and, although his left shoulder much torn he looked somewhat confused, he well able accompany back camp. He knew matter did. Suddenly he felt carried jaws big animal, he said, "naturally made best use his fists get free." Billy looked much ashamed himself, compelled acknowledge he must dozing, he certainly see tiger coming. "It shows must keep wide awake, none us reach end journey," said Tom. "Now, sooner get away better; sound shots may attracted attention natives neighbourhood." Casey, accustomed see sorts wounds, assisted bind hurt poor Peter, declared he perfectly ready continue march. As afraid lighting fire food, pushed cool hours morning, intending take substantial meal soon hot proceed. They little difficulty, however, making way amid creepers climbing plants, which, hanging tree tree, interlaced perfect network. They often, therefore, hunt could discover open place, could advance. They calculated pushed forward ten miles, reached stream, arched tall trees, hung numberless flowers, bearing climbers great beauty varied brilliant colours. Many convolvulus-shaped, prodigious size, white yellow, spotted red, others pale violet. There scarlet flowers, blue, sulphur-coloured flowers, others similar tints, striped spotted curious way. But far interesting hungry travellers numberless water-fowl, flew stream, Tom Desmond minutes knocked several kingfishers, storks, ducks, amply sufficient supply hands food. The two natives had, mean time, searching honey nuts, brought supply. The latter grew enormous trees great distance. The natives picked ground fallen, bitten parrots. The outer she will black hard, size shape lemon, kernel, enclosed thick inner covering, white hard, resembling chestnuts roasted. "Hurrah!" cried Billy. "We shall run risk starving, events. These nuts serve us bread, honey stay appetites." The fire quickly blazing up, birds, plucked spitted, placed it. A sharp look-out kept every side natives, snakes, tigers, wild beasts might tempted pay visit. Tom urged his friends keep together much possible, always arms ready. After good rest pushed on, encamped evening bank large river, doubt one come canoe. While Casey Peter lighting fire, two Papuans looking honey, Tom Desmond shooting birds supper, Billy went water fill large gourd Pipes procured them. Just he dip in, long snout appeared surface, possessor which--a huge crocodile-- made directly him. Billy, throwing gourd, scampered off. Fortunately monster stopped instant pick gourd, crushed huge jaws, thus Billy able increase his distance. Pat Casey Peter, hearing his cries, started rifles, ran forward uttered loud shouts distract attention crocodile. Still, determined monster seize poor Billy, seem heed them. "Jump one side, sir, jump one side!" cried Casey Billy, followed advice, seaman, levelling his rifle, poured contents crocodile's throat. It immediately rolled over, struggles lay dead. Tom Desmond considered advisable return move away river. Fortunately so, sitting round fire cooking game, dozen crocodiles crept water came towards them. The whole party, starting feet, shouted shrieked, Tom Desmond fired throats couple saurians rest turn tail, when, plunging water, disappeared beneath surface. "If do not keep bright look-out night one us carried off, depend upon that," observed Tom. His warning good effect, agreed two party keep watch together, risk attack crocodiles one side tigers other, speak big serpents creatures. The dangerous scorpions, several seen five six inches long, stings natives asserted would deprive person life course hour less. "Oh dear, oh dear!" sighed Billy. "I knew journey would fatiguing enough, I little thought trouble horrid beasts would us." For several days travelled along course river, taking care camp near enough bank surprised hungry crocodile. On several occasions caught sight tigers, three shot came nearer pleasant. Among vast numbers feathered tribe perched trees, flitted amid boughs, soared high air, beautiful birds paradise, brilliant colours graceful forms, Tom Desmond agreed shame kill could obtain much game different species required. Monkeys various sizes seen, larger cats others half big man. The travellers moving on, Nick Pipes scouting front, three midshipmen following, Casey black bringing rear. Presently heard loud chattering overhead, came shower nuts, one hit Billy nose. The pain made cry out, his voice replied shrieks laughter overhead, followed another volley. On looking caught sight large troop big monkeys scampering bough bough, descending close possible order get nearer intruders domain. One old fellow spat right Desmond, he saw shot successful, shrieked chuckled laughter he climbed back secure part bough. The monkeys this, emboldened success increased numbers, discharged volleys missiles descriptions, disagreeable character, three midshipmen followers fairly put flight, monkeys pursuing them, chattering shrieking made escape forest, fortunately came termination. "I will pay this!" cried Desmond, sufferer Billy, and, firing, he brought one monkeys, rest set fearful cries, shaking fists making sorts defiant grimaces. They entered region totally different hitherto passed through. It vast open prairie, covered many places long grass, amid snakes large size seen creeping, Nick assured Tom venomous, would afford meal time, game abundant. The difficulty walking grass considerable, lift feet high every step, exposed rays sun. Having hitherto obtained much water required, occur might fail procure it. They caught sight herds buffalo deer, none day came near enough shot. All day trudged without water, well nigh ready drop thirst. "I shall die I do not get something drink," cried poor Billy. Tom got Casey Peter lift shoulders he might obtain thereby wider view, nowhere stream lake seen. He, however, caught sight several round yellow objects ground, getting nearer, great joy party discover melons, produce creeper ivy-shaped leaves. The fruit proved even refreshing water, enabled march several hours night. This hopes reaching clump trees next day sun attained greatest height. At last, overcome fatigue, compelled camp open prairie without afire. They afraid lighting one lest ignite grass. After hours' rest moved on. Already sun risen every moment gaining strength, saw grove palm trees rising plain. Although hastened steps went time, still seemed long way off, happily found abundance water melons, quenched thirst. Without must perished. They also getting hungry, open country honey nuts procured, birds come near them. A flight parrots passed heads, high shot, Billy crying he die, herd buffaloes seen scampering across plain towards them. "Down, down!" cried two Papuans; "dey see us den." The whole party hid tall grass, rifles ready action. There seemed great likelihood, however, buffaloes would trample death came rushing furiously dreaming danger. The leading animals close upon Nick Pipes jumped waved hands, shouting loudly time. This turned herd slightly, swept animals presented good shot, concealed foes, Tom Gerald, fired, two young bulls rolled over. The rest successful, first two fired time re-load, herd range. The two buffaloes shot were, however, sufficient wants, instant Casey Peter, aided Papuans, engaged long knives flaying two beasts, cutting pieces flesh could carry. Here supply food would last long would keep good. The midshipmen fancy eating raw, rest party fastidious, cut favourite bits, clapped mouths evident satisfaction. They were, consequence, better able bear loads meat midshipmen, satisfied two three water melons apiece. At length clump trees reached. The party seated shade enjoyed cool air played among tall stems. Having cleared away grass front them, lighted fire cooked part meat, rest cut strips hung sun dry. It fortunate took precaution. For two days travelled without meeting drop water, existed water melons, prevented suffering thirst--as valuable plant similar species exists arid sands Africa many weary traveller, well wild beasts roam sandy regions. They keeping look-out ahead prominent object steer, when, sun rose one day, marching night, his rays fell seemed like white cone rising plain. As pushed rose higher higher, although seemed far ever. "Why, must snow-covered mountain!" exclaimed Tom. "I hope shall climb it, although I object good roll snow cool myself," said Billy. In spite eagerness compelled rest first wood reached, near banks stream. As party lay fast asleep shade, Tom, watch, observed herd small deer apparently coming drink. He roused Desmond, taking rifles crept behind two trees. The deer came single file. They graceful little animals dark drab colour backs sides, white underneath, pretty large antlers. Without hesitation began cross stream, passing along close midshipmen concealed. Tom selected one animal Gerald another, firing brought two ground. The rest deer looked much astonished, take flight. Those crossed still continued course before. This gave Tom Gerald time re-load, brought two animals. Not herd bound confusion. The firing roused rest party. Tom Desmond eagerly rushing despatch one deer quite dead, saw large tiger, following herd, going seize hold one slain deer. The beast looked them, seemed spring. Neither re-loaded his rifle, Tom immediately began so, keeping his eyes tiger. "Do not move, Desmond," he cried out, "or brute spring you!" Desmond, imitating Tom's coolness, also began load, tiger mean time lashing his tail showing his huge teeth, he kept paw one deer, he seemed claim his prize. "Now!" cried Tom. "I will fire his head, his shoulder." Just tiger make spring might proved fatal one party, Tom fired hit head. The creature gave bound air. Desmond's bullet struck moment he rolled dead. "Well done, honour!" cried Casey, come up; "that fine shot." "Hurrah! shall venison now," exclaimed Billy, followed him. "We shall want it," said Tom, "if climb mountains ahead, likely shall find food there." The deer collected, without delay hands set work cook fresh flesh dry remainder. Three days found foot large lofty mountain, get south must crossed. Each man cut stout stick, end he pointed fire. Their dried meat held out; fortunately shot couple deer herd came drink pool near camp, thus next morning daybreak, provisions strapped backs, commenced ascent. The cone seen distance rose high left hand, discovered passage lower down. Up climbed, feeling cold increase, suffering intensely heat plain. At length could difficulty breathe, desire sleep seized party. Tom, knowing danger giving way it, urged his companions keep moving. Once Peter sat down, declaring he could go further. Tom Desmond dragged up, told Casey prick point his stick he attempted stop again. Poor Billy puffed panted, last declared "he must snooze." "It will not side," cried Desmond. "Haul along! Do want leave bones here, come us? Just think venison pasties parrot pies get civilised country!" Thus urged, Billy exerted afresh. None could afterwards describe way got mountain. For several miles dragged snow, fear sinking crevice hollow, fearful precipices yawned one side, other. The two Papuans held bravely, and, considering scanty clothing, surprising. For considerable time whole party moved without speaking, staggering sleep. Their eyes dazzled whiteness snow, surrounded sides. Above heads hung icicles fantastic shapes, ornamenting cliff crag. At length summit pass gained, commenced descent, less painful knew soon would get warmer region. By nightfall reached valley, trees afforded fuel light fire, round gathered, genial blaze restoring warmth frozen limbs. For two days continued among mountains, gradually attained lower altitude, last found tolerably level country. As far could see south, rose ranges hills, hoped, skirting round bases, avoid sufferings lately endured. The cooler air region enabled make longer journeys before. They travelling along range hills, shut country south view. Having crossed these, encamped one evening rocky ground, whence saw away left conical mountains, several thousand feet height, obtained view. There appeared clouds rising summits, they, however, took little notice, busy preparing night. Tom Desmond, usual, hunting game. They shot several birds couple monkeys, immediately brought camp cooked. After heat endured, finding night chilly, piled pieces rock slabs bark form shelter wind. They stretched sleep, exception Casey, keep first watch, aroused loud exclamation uttered him, time thundering sound feeling earth shake beneath them. Starting feet, eyes attracted bright light, rose mountain, shooting upwards, increased size, assumed mushroom appearance, top extending far wide round mountain. It volcano suddenly burst forth. No lava, however, seen descending sides, felt shower fine ashes falling heads. The screen put up, however, partially sheltered it. Nothing could done, resolved remain were, hoping eruption would increase. Further sleep question; night long watched fearful flames, expecting every moment find fiery shower falling upon them. "It might much worse," said Tom. "We might close it, here, events, get little peppered." Towards morning eruption began subside, daylight dense smoke seen ascending crater. In spite want sleep, continued march, hoping get well southward. As none party pocket-books, unable note description curious creatures met wonderful scenery passed through. They frequently saw serpents fifteen twenty feet length, huge apes, upwards five feet height, hideous features, almost human shape. They thankful got volcanic region, although endure heat plains. What joy, ascending low ridge, see wide expanse water, glittering sun. "The sea! sea!" exclaimed Billy. Casey Peter echoed cry. Had truly reached termination journey? Tom doubted it. Looking his telescope, he discovered east west, low shore. It might estuary extending long way inland, might still many days' journey coast. Whether really sea fresh water lake, could determined getting tasting waters. With stout hearts marched on. They well supplied food. Seldom many hours passed without meeting herds deer buffalo, obtained ample supply food. Smaller game, monkeys parrots, abundance woods, plenty streams lakelets pure water, often took refreshing bath. Billy, whose spirits risen expectation reaching coast, insisted last water seen height sea. Casey black agreed him. At last got close it. They hurried forward. Fortunately bank reached hard, without difficulty got water. Billy dipped his hand. "It is fresh!" he exclaimed, he tasted it. "I sure that," said Tom. "It is lake, good big one too. We couple hundred miles yet coast." They continued course along western shore lake, spent fully four days reached southern end, calculating rate travelled must seventy eighty miles long. After another range mountains pass, which, though wild rugged extreme, less elevation north. Once level country, covered tall grass. They crossed several streams, wading one huge crocodile made dash nearly caught poor Billy. Nick Pipes began examine country curious eyes before, last led native path. "Friends there!" said Pipes, pointing ahead, saw opening trees several huts. The two Papuans hurried on, begging friends sit shade. In short time returned large party natives, who, ugly were, smiling faces. One seemed chief, advanced Tom made speech, Pipes, accompanied him, interpreted invitation strangers come his village. "Good mans!" said Pipes. "Plenty food!" The invitation was, course, accepted. The chief, taking Tom hand signing rest follow, led towards village, consisted number large huts composed wooden frames covered mats, floor also spread. The chief begged his visitors sit down, ordered food brought in. A number yellow-skinned damsels short time appeared, bearing boiled rice messes roasted stewed monkey yams. Whatever midshipmen might formerly thought repast, acknowledged delicious. Calabashes full toddy, prepared sap cocoa-nut tree, introduced. "I say!" said Tom, he drunk two three cups, "we better take much this, shall find fou." They wisely declined pressing invitation chief imbibe apparently harmless liquor, two Papuan friends, long absence, seemed enjoy it, short time perfectly drunk. This misfortune, could longer communicate friendly chief. However, he made signs lie mats. Feeling confident his honesty, willingly complied his request. After day's rest, party greatly required, Nick Pipes recovered, set village coast, thirty miles distant. Here two Papuans found friends relatives, welcomed cordially, long given lost. The chief village, Nick Pipes related, requested midshipmen take abode his hut. It situated midst grove magnificent trees, near garden, growing yams, bananas, pumpkins, many vegetables fruits. They glad accept invitation, hut considerable size, floor spread neatly mats, perfectly clean. The reception over, made way shores harbour, where, among several Chinese strange craft, satisfaction see English brig. CHAPTER TWELVE. THE MASTER OF THE FOX--BARGAIN FOR A PASSAGE--TRADING WITH THE NATIVES-- FAREWELL TO FRIENDS--THE SKIPPER'S RASCALLY TRICK--THE FOX WITH THE MIDSHIPMEN ON BOARD AT SEA--BAD FARE--FISHING--A SHARK CAPTURED, AND THE SKIPPER KNOCKED OVER--SHORT OF WATER--THE FOX STRUCK BY A SQUALL-- CAPSIZED--THE MIDSHIPMEN HOLD ON TO THE SIDE OF THE BRIG--IN A DESPERATE CONDITION--A SAIL--TAKEN OFF BY A BOAT FROM THE EMPRESS--FOX FOUNDERS-- WELCOMED ON BOARD--SYDNEY REACHED--A PLEASANT VISIT ON SHORE--BOUND FOR NEW ZEALAND. While midshipmen standing shore harbour boat put brig, came towards them. She pulled four hands, two blacks two Malays. A stout white man, broad-brimmed straw hat, evidently skipper, sat stern sheets. On landing, latter, looking hard them, surveying travel-stained, tattered uniforms, inquired-- "Where world come from?" "From side New Guinea," answered Tom. He briefly narrated adventures. "We want get Sydney, expect find ship. Can take us there?" he added. "That depends circumstances," answered skipper. "Can pay passage?" "We work it, events, I doubt captain pay sum agree to," said Tom. Tom like either manner appearance skipper. Of course he express his opinion, either words looks. "Are bound Sydney?" inquired Tom; "for, so, may come terms." "As that, I mind putting there, provided pay expenses. I thinking going south, I quite made mind," answer. "The _Fox_ fine craft, another chance getting Sydney, English port many months come. Few British traders touch here." "I see several Chinese junks Malay proas. We may chance getting Banda, Dutch port, Singapore," said Tom, determined done, he could help it, master _Fox_. "You wish board _Fox_ sail one craft, I tell you," said skipper. "Come, better close me, I will undertake land Sydney. What say 30 pounds head, payment provisions liquors consume? It mighty deal better sweltering hot place, chance knocked head, brought fever." Tom thought charge exorbitant, probably small sum would added provisions. He drew Desmond Billy aside consult them. They opinion captain would certainly unwilling pay large amount. They soon returned master _Fox_ standing watching them. "May I ask name?" said Tom. "Yes; it is Stubbins; I have reason ashamed it." "Well, Captain Stubbins, pay twenty pounds a-head ourselves, fifteen men, besides pound day provisions." "You sharp young gentlemen, I have opinion," said skipper. "If do not like terms stay wish accepted them. I shall away fortnight more, I came yesterday, get rid cargo take fresh one board." Accompanied Captain Stubbins returned hut chief, was, found, principal trader place. He skipper appeared well acquainted, arrangements trading soon concluded. The _Fox_ brought cargo miscellaneous articles, consisting gorgeously coloured calicoes patterns attract savage taste--firearms, powder shot, axes, knives, articles ironware, small amount execrable rum spirits. The skipper invited natives board, took good care ply liquor he commenced trading. The chief his people stores collected purpose, consisting birds paradise, monkey skins, pearls, various kinds wood bark gums, drugs spices, besides cocoa-nuts, fruit vegetables. They showed keen traders; evident that, meet certain sale obtain fair prices, would ready collect large amount valuable produce, doubt country furnishes. Captain Stubbins, obtained produce collected natives, urged obtain supply villages interior; parties set various directions goods brought make purchases. Thus midshipmen detained month instead fortnight; and, Captain Stubbins would abate his demands, finally compelled accept them. Immediately agreed his terms, skipper's manner changed. He appeared anxious accommodate every way his power. He persuaded come live board, would comfortable hut chief, he would ready, wind come fair, put sea moment, without wait them. The midshipmen agreed his proposal, carrying several monkeys, cages full birds, hospitable chief given them. In return his kindness presented rifles, gave Nick Pipes two seamen's muskets, articles could spare, promising send honest fellows opportunity occur forwarding things Sydney, reward fidelity. The two Papuans chief highly delighted grateful gifts, looked upon ample return services rendered. The brig looked like menagerie, number creatures captain crew taking, mostly monkeys birds, found Australia. The natives returned considerable amount produce, skipper received board, promising send goods payment shore. In mean time he presented, apparent generosity, kegs spirits chief his people. The midshipmen, Casey, Peter turned night, dark, wind shore. They heard skipper go deck, soon asleep again. Not long awakened sound windlass. "Why must weighing anchor!" exclaimed Tom. He Desmond dressed, went deck. The brig already way, standing harbour. "Why, Captain Stubbins, you have forgotten send goods shore, return produce came yesterday!" "Bless heart! I have!" answered skipper, hoarse laugh. "I will pay people next time I come here; drunk time know whether I paid not; and, knowing hurry get Sydney, wind fair, I could resist temptation putting sea." Tom made reply, he strong suspicion skipper intended cheat poor natives, such, indeed, he found case. When morning dawned, _Fox_ far beyond possibility pursuit natives, even chiefs condition follow her, probability not, owing cunningly bestowed kegs liquor. The breeze continued, _Fox_ made good way. The skipper his mate constantly look-out avoid rocks shoals thickly dot entrance Torres Straits. The brig stood eastward, run well clear coral reefs fringe north-eastern portion Australia. Tom his companions thankful length find themselves, dangers toils gone through, way place could hope meet ship; time, little comfort boast board. Their berths narrow recesses either side little cabin, close extreme, swarmed, moreover, cockroaches creeping things, scorpions centipedes, come board cargo occasionally made appearance. "I do not care beasts, hungry are, pleasant know one may stung moment them," said Desmond, he brought his knife one fallen breakfast table. As long fresh provisions lasted, fared pretty well, exhausted, reduced short commons, and, Desmond observed, "very bad sort." Salt junk, made, perhaps, one voyage round world, mouldy biscuit, constituted chief ingredients meals. The midshipmen complained, skipper replied he gave best he had. Billy especially declared he die inanition. "Salt junk never agreed best times, like old horse beef," he groaned, he turned piece black-looking stuff end his fork. The men quite ill off--they could worse; found officers faring badly were, could complain. The old brig sailed like tub even breeze, last wind dropped lay becalmed day day sun striking heads. They found hot enough frequently travelling country; sometimes even hotter. On journey events abundance food, refreshing fruits, clear water, tepid, thick, brackish liquid drink. When made faces poured meal time, skipper remarked grin-- "You are better none, many weeks longer voyage maybe shall condition." Tom suggested soon breeze sprang up, steer Brisbane, one northern Australian ports, skipper would listen proposal. He preferred keeping open sea, free reefs existed nearer land. Tom observed already much eastward necessary, Captain Stubbins, though he evidently great navigator, declared he knew his way well naval officer, refused lend Tom his quadrant make observation. Billy looked melancholy, declared voyage continue much longer he give ghost. "If could catch fish better," said Tom. "Suppose ask skipper he got hooks lines." "I doubt whether old fellow take trouble look he has," observed Desmond. Billy applied proposed, greatly his delight mats produced shark hook several others smaller size, supply lines. In minutes hands busy lines overboard bits pork beef bait. Several curious fish hauled up, native crew pronounced poisonous, declared ate would die. This tantalising. While engaged sport, Toby--Desmond's favourite monkey, he taught sorts tricks--hopped bulwarks see about. "Take care doing, Master Toby," sang Desmond, springing forward catch monkey, dangerous proximity shark hook line. Toby, expecting caught, made spring, rope take hold of, lost his balance, he went water. Desmond, fond little animal, threw line, calling catch hold it, monkey, finding water, much alarmed obey his directions. "I will go him," cried Desmond, point leaping overboard, Toby uttered cry agony, black snout seen rise instant, white shark's belly glanced water, Toby disappeared beneath surface. "The horrid brute!" exclaimed Desmond; "we pay can." The fishermen persevered, Desmond caught good-looking fish Tom another. "I have got one!" cried Billy, pulling away. "Here, Desmond, come help haul in--he must big fellow." They hauled away line, suddenly came rapidly, shark's nose appeared water; moment, next Billy Desmond sprawling deck hook bitten way shank. "Bad luck beast! It is ate poor Toby," cried Desmond, he picked up. "I hope he run away hooks," said Tom. "It well haul he gets hold them." Directly afterwards line shark hook attached seen pulled violently. "Hurrah! voracious brute got hold hook intended him," cried Tom. "Let us haul he breaks clear." All hands ran line. Casey made bowline round line, ready slip shark's head soon appear water. Could got round body, capture would certain. Peter, mean time, got another ready slip tail. The mate Malays came assistance midshipmen. Keeping steady pull line, soon brought head big shark surface. It bolted hook, biting away chain secured shank. "He will do not make haste!" cried Tom. "Quick, quick, Casey! slip bowline round him!" The seaman managed dexterously this, rest crew, hauling away, length got body water. It huge creature, ten feet long. It struggled desperately, beating water foam alongside, time Peter could get rope round tail. That done close prisoner. "Keep lines taut, he will wriggling carry hook line!" cried Tom. At last got flush bulwarks, came, knocking poor Billy two native crew. Had Tom Desmond rushed forward hauled Billy way, he would beaten mummy furious lashing creature's tail. For several moments possession deck, length Casey Peter, got hold axe apiece, rushed dealt blow across tail, springing back next instant way. Again repeat blows. It time struggles monster ceased. "I should not like way fellow's jaws," exclaimed Billy, he examined shark's head. Just creature gave heave, Billy sprang back, knocking Peter, who, his turn, tumbling skipper, brought sprawling deck. Captain Stubbins, getting up, furiously attacked poor Peter, he tumbled intentionally, and, seizing rope, began belabour severely. This excited Tom's Desmond's indignation. "You have business treat poor fellow way," exclaimed Tom; "and I will allow it!" "Who you?" said skipper. "This mutiny, I will clap companions irons soon look you." "We Queen's officers, cannot allow man charge treated poor fellow," answered Tom, determined tone. The skipper, muttering furious oath, without another word retired his cabin, presently re-appeared pistol his hand, another sticking his pocket. Tom fixed his eye calmly upon him. "We fear threats, Captain Stubbins," he said. "If kill one us, would guilty murder, would hung certainty. Let advise you, then, take pistols back cabin. We wish insult dispute authority. Our messmate, black's falling you, ready apologise: I hope satisfy you." "Really, Captain Stubbins, I sorry happened," exclaimed Billy; "and I sure shark would he could speak, he, all, misfortune. Had he given unexpected plunge, I tumbled knocked Peter, Peter would knocked you. I promise shall occur again, I will keep clear delicately browned slices placed table. I never ate shark, I will undertake shall better salt beef board." By time Billy finished his apology skipper's anger somewhat cooled down, he still walked deck pistol his hand, Tom Desmond kept eye upon lest he sudden take his head fire one them. At last, greatly satisfaction, he went below, replaced pistols his berth. Several fish caught this, midshipmen reduced eat shark. On cutting open, poor Toby discovered within, served _bonne bouche_ crew, midshipmen contenting fish. As long calm lasted, fish could obtained, passengers crew _Fox_ fare ill; midshipmen anxious get disagreeable passage rejoin ship, would gladly gone short commons made quick passage. The water every day became worse diminished quantity, serious apprehensions might result. "If could manage construct still friend American doctor formed sand-bank, might obtain fresh water," observed Tom. "I am sure I do not know exactly done," answered Desmond, "but I remember principle, feel pretty sure I could manage one board understands blacksmith's work. Steam produce fast enough largest tea-kettle board; chief difficulty condenser." When, however, Tom mentioned his idea Captain Stubbins, skipper laughed him, declared he could he tried, blacksmith board. A breeze springing made less necessary Tom try his experiment, skipper asserted water would hold could get Sydney. He was, however, time keeping much eastward necessary. Tom Desmond agreed he aware far he land, though he would find his mistake he came haul westward. "Well, I wish voyage over," exclaimed poor Billy, hard fare beginning tell, though he wonderfully withstood long journey across country. "I shall losing number mess horrid brig does not make better way she hitherto doing." There seemed every probability voyage prolonged. Now wind contrary, fell calm; even fair wind tub brig seldom made five six knots hour. The heat cabin midshipmen never remained longer could help, much night spent deck. The skipper, contrary, seemed seasoned amount heat, constantly below. One night, supper hard, cold, salt beef, could eat cutting thinnest slices--mouldy biscuit, rum muddy water--they went deck, found Casey Peter, taking meal description. Excepting watch, rest crew below. "Any chance getting in, sir?" asked Casey Tom. "It pretty well time there, I have trying learn quantity water got board. As far I make out, we have got gallon most, will not keep tongues moist couple days." "I doubt whether master aware this," said Tom, "for he takes matter easy, he ought put hands allowance this. He must so, shall dying thirst drop anchor Sydney harbour." The brig time sail, wind light, she making little way. Suddenly her sails gave loud flap mast. "We going another calm, I fear," said Desmond. "I am quite sure that," said Casey. "I have watching sky, seems thick gloom spreading it. I have observed dark bank rising rapidly southward eastward. Look, sir, cannot see star quarter. If I mate, I would shorten sail once." Tom Desmond took survey horizon quarter Casey pointing. The bank rising rapidly; looked, indeed, dark curtain drawn sky. "I will point mate," said Tom. On going aft, Tom found mate seated close taffrail. Instead keeping look-out, he fast asleep. Tom roused up, pointed appearance sky. "I do not think it is anything," he observed, rubbing his eyes. "It is, though," cried Tom. "Listen roar." At moment dull rushing sound heard, long streak white seen extending east south-west across ocean. "Turn hands up! shorten sail!" cried Tom. The mate repeated order. The midshipmen sprang main-topsail halyards, Casey Peter fore-topsail; almost rope could let go, fierce blast struck brig. In vain mate tried put helm up. Over she heeled more, yardarms touched water. Tom Desmond seized hold Billy, dropped sleep, scrambled weather bulwarks. Casey Peter same. Another instant brig her beam ends, water rising combings hatchway. Believing brig going over, midshipmen companions got outside bulwarks, holding main-chains. As lee side sails already water, probability brig would rise again. Every moment, indeed, seemed she must go down. Their position truly fearful one. The mate man helm apparently slipped water, nowhere visible. Of two men forward, one succeeded gaining bulwarks, probably shared fate mate. The condition terrible. Unable gain deck, probably drowned berths. Although main hatchway closed, fore companion hatches open. The wind howled doomed brig; sea getting up. The midshipmen believed she must quickly founder fate sealed. "We gone many danger together," said Tom, Desmond; "but I believe time come last. I wish brother Jack could known fate. He sorry us, home." "It cannot helped," said Desmond. "I liked live longer, better poor fellows drowning berths." "What! Do think brig going down?" cried Billy. "Dear me, dreadful; cannot get something float upon?" "As water rushing her fearfully fast, I do not see chance her floating," answered Tom. "However, give hope she remains water. Perhaps, squall passed over, may manage scramble along masts cut away topgallant yards, get hold gratings spare spars form raft." "We must quick it, then," observed Desmond; "for old craft may go moment." "While wind blowing now, use making attempt," said Tom. "She appear sunk lower she she first went over. She light cargo, float longer vessel heavily laden." The midshipmen, however, could talk much, difficult matter make hear, sound wind, sea dashing hull brig, showers spray fell them. They could distinguish figures Casey Peter, another man holding fore-rigging, yet unable exchange words them, afraid let go hold, lest washed sea. The gale continued blow furiously, two hours perfect hurricane raged. It suddenly ceased, sea--though rapidly--began go down. On hopes revived. Tom anxious ascertain Casey's opinion, made his way fore-rigging. "I would stick hull, sir," answered Pat. "The brig floated long; she may float longer, better wait daylight attempt make raft. We may chance slip sea, one savage sharks may watching chance get hold us." Tom followed Casey's advice, without much difficulty regained his former position. Never night appeared long party. Notwithstanding position, however, Billy constantly dropping sleep, Tom Desmond hold on, he would certainty fallen water. As morning approached, sea became perfectly calm. They would thankful breeze, might bring vessel succour. What hope could surviving many hours bottom brig? The sun rose. Almost exhausted, midshipmen could difficulty hold on. As turned weary eyes directions, object sight. "No land seen?" asked poor Billy. "That may couple hundred miles away, I fear," answered Tom. "Any vessel coming help?" inquired Billy, who, stretched rigging, could lift his head. "Without breath air, chance that," said Desmond; "but cheer up, Billy, perhaps steamer coming way." "There many likely cruising direction," observed Tom. "However, I said along, hope best." "Oh! I am hungry; thirsty," moaned younger midshipman. "Cannot get something eat?" "If go cabin, find nothing," said Desmond. "The last cask water starboard side, hung out, must full salt water time." The midshipmen relapsed silence. The sun rose higher higher, beams striking fury heads; even Tom, strongest, felt could hold much longer. Hour hour went by; still, perish, something must done. He asked Casey men whether chance fish-hooks pockets? They searched, vain, going look them, declared would impossible. The brig, however, continued float; something, Tom could help acknowledging would unable hold another night. Even he, he felt pangs hunger his mouth parched thirst, began despair. Desmond Billy already far gone. He gazed countenances his two messmates. "They will never see another sun rise, shall I?" Tom began seriously consider best prepare his inevitable fate. Just Casey sang out, "A breeze! breeze! I felt cheek, moment ago!" He endeavoured wet his finger his parched tongue, could hardly so. He held his hand. "It is southward, manage build raft, may yet reach land, get line vessels running Sydney northern ports." These exclamations aroused Tom; even Desmond looked up. "A breeze! Yes, indeed, is, sail too. She standing towards us!" He pointed southward. A patch white canvas, sun shining brightly, appeared blue ocean. Casey, time, caught sight it. "Hurrah! hurrah! saved; she cannot fail see us." The cheer taken his companions misfortune. Even Billy lifted his head. "Is true, Rogers, see sail?" he asked. "As true here, must make sure discovered," replied Tom. "Sure, would passing us, get sight wreck," said Desmond. "That is may happen do," answered Tom, become much less sanguine formerly, and, hungry worn out, inclined look dark side things. The breeze increased, stranger drew nearer nearer. Tom Desmond opinion she man-of-war. Casey thought same. The question was, however, whether she would pass by. She steering due west, object low water hull brig was, might visible. On she came, she south-east them, yet evident board seen wreck, though she herself easily made large man-of-war steamer. Proudly she gliding on, her yards braced she stood towards brig. "Thank Heaven, longer doubt it!" cried Tom. "Rouse up, Billy, rouse up, boy! We right! Here comes steamer assistance, that, I am sure she _Empress_, craft like her would difficult distinguish one other." Poor Billy could raise his head smile faintly, he ejaculated, "Thank Heaven, too!" Tom undoubtedly right. In minutes _Empress_ almost within hail, boat lowered, rapid strokes came pulling towards them. Mr Norman, last parted coast Papua, her, he evidently recognise them, supposing part brig's crew. "Slide down, catch you," he cried out, boat pulled close keel brig, rigging preventing her approaching deck side. "Billy shall go first," said Tom, making rope fast round messmate, he Desmond lowered down. "Handsomely, handsomely!" cried lieutenant, "or boy's skin torn his back. Why! here?" exclaimed Mr Norman astonishment, looking Billy's haggard countenance recognising rather his faded tattered uniform his features. "Do not know me, sir?" asked Billy, faint voice. He could say more. "Bless heart, you? Rogers Desmond?" "Here are, answer ourselves," said Tom, who, Desmond, managed aid rope get close boat, helped men, although weak state, overcome exertion made, could hardly stand. They handed stern sheets, boat moving took three men fashion. Scarcely dear brig she righted, she began rapidly settle down. The midshipmen companions received hearty congratulations board _Empress_, one her captain, truly thankful get back his younger brother, whose fate he long intensely anxious. The _Orion_, astern, came up, Adair informed his nephew safe, although apparently precarious condition. It several days midshipmen could give account adventures. When able use tongues, little rest, every one eager know done seen, must acknowledged sometimes inclined indulge hearers travellers' tales. By time reached Sydney well enough come deck look magnificent scenery superb harbour. Of stay there, although full interest themselves, brief account alone given. They received kindest way inhabitants, spent weeks house old friend Rogers' family. Their friends, Mr Mrs Calvert, several daughters, contributed little make stay agreeable. On first arrival young gentlemen compelled keep rooms, considered sufficiently recovered bear excitement society. They allowed starve, however. A handsome repast sent them, pledging glasses light Australian wine, found refreshing, two captains entered room. "I congratulate you," said Jack, he handed two official-looking letters, one Tom Desmond, respectively addressed Lieutenant Thomas Rogers Lieutenant Gerald Desmond. The envelopes contained commissions. "Those papers, I suspect, set anything else," said Jack. "Indeed will, although long enough coming," answered Tom. "Faith! I could get dance jig forthwith," exclaimed Desmond. "You would better not, case ladies arrive congratulate you," observed his uncle. "Is letter me? I wonder I shall get promoted!" asked Billy his corner room. "All good time," answered Jack. "Perhaps opportunity long something distinguish yourself." Next morning two lieutenants Billy able come downstairs. Their promotion wonderful effect Tom Desmond, talked joked great rate fair hostesses. As might supposed, young lieutenants lost hearts, even Billy Blueblazes, though still midshipman, became sentimental he ever known been, juvenile ladies object his adoration. A copy verses, he begun compose her praise, though yet he got far them, afforded subject amusement his messmates. Their visit shore was, however, brought abruptly end, consequence two ships ordered New Zealand. CHAPTER THIRTEEN.

Each two ships carried party volunteers, raised assist New Zealand colonists regular troops putting Maori rebellion, time broken out. The part northern island New Zealand natives taken arms, region mountains, hills, valleys, lakes streams, several rivers considerable size, Thames Waikato largest. The ground either covered dense forest scrub, long grass, thickly growing flax plant, afforded cover Maoris engagements British troops. The rebels frequently defeated, fought bravely occasions, sometimes successfully defended themselves. The commander-in-chief resolved attack strong pah, one principal chiefs, large body followers, held out, ships war ordered round, men larger ones might landed co-operate troops, smaller vessels gun-boats proceeded river bombard enemy's fortifications assaulted. The Maoris already shown brave intelligent foes, that, savages though called, way despised. Jack Adair dining together board _Empress_. They intended land next day eighty men several officers, assist troops attack pah. It situated hill way river. The smaller steamers gun-boats convey troops tow men-of-war's boats blue-jackets board. Besides pah, strong entrenchments thrown Maoris, reaching right bank river lake opposite side pah, thus completely blocking road. In addition fortifications, two lines rifle-pits, dangerous style defence attack hands desperate enemy. Both soldiers sailors knew child's play engaged, that, savage foe, many life might lost he would compelled succumb. Jack unusually grave. Adair laughed joked, his custom. "If I fall to-morrow," said Jack, "tell Julia I longed return home her. There letter her, I wrote last night, desk. I left executor. My worldly affairs good order, much trouble. My letter contains chiefly expressions devoted affection directions." "Of course I everything wish, misfortune happen, I believe bullet cast deprive life, Jack," answered Adair. "You will get flag, I hope get mine one days; although I know possible bit lead may find out, yet chances will not hit vital part. Still, case thing happen, bear affectionate farewells Lucy, though she knows I love her `apple eye.'" Gerald come board see Tom, four relatives spent evening together. The two young lieutenants join attack. At early hour next morning expedition commenced ascent river. It sufficiently wide deep float steamers considerable size, current strong, greatly impeded progress. It arranged simultaneous attacks made fortifications them. The steamers carried troops destined assault southern end pah proceeded river. Jack Terence men, landed north side fortifications, directed proceed close neck land, sweeping round, left shoulders foremost, attack entrenchments part would reach. Their guide conducted reached foot low ridge beyond gunshot enemy. Here remain signal made commence action. Jack Tom climbed among low brushwood lined top ridge, whence could see pah attacked. It formidable-looking place, deep ditch front, strong palisades, must pulled escaladed could entered. Through his glass Jack observed line dark heads musket barrels shining sun. These outer defences; within entrenchments pits, probably concealing host determined enemies, reported pah held nearly thousand men. The blue-jackets cared little difficulties dangers them. They laughing joking usual, eagerly looking forward signal assault works. In mean time troops, landed, marching destined positions, object general completely surround pah none garrison could escape give trouble. Just officer arrived, directing Captain Rogers keep his men reserve. This disappointment, hoped among first fort. At length gun-boats, got position, opened fire fort. Their shot, however, produced little effect wide open space fell, enemy numberless pits holes could protect themselves. The larger steamers impeded current, unable get position whence could discharge shot pah. At length rocket flew hill north end river, signal attack. It answered another south end, troops, rising behind cover concealed enemy, rushed forward towards pah, landed joining right. They received withering fire fortifications, brought many ground, but, nothing daunted, pushed forward plant scaling ladders palisades. The first line quickly gained. More soldiers, landed, joined first assailants, enemy retreated centre redoubt, seemed determined defend themselves. The troops south side time fighting way across lines rifle-pits, enemy firing deadly effect. One pit another taken, occupants bayoneted, others, losing heart, leaped endeavoured make escape across lake east, outlet remained them. The main body enemy held centre fortification, strongest description. In vain desperate attack made gallant party artillery. So high palisades scaling ladders could reach summit. Their commanding officer, searching spot entrance might made, brought mortally wounded ground. Other officers fell; length soldiers retire. "Now, Captain Rogers, see do?" said _aide-de-camp_, despatched general. "On, lads!" cried Jack. He Adair led way, followed hot speed men. Terence brought number hand-grenades, carried party Desmond's command. It hoped, throwing in, enemy would driven spot, time allowed seamen climb palisades. The naval party received hot fire met troops. The brave Maoris, disconcerted repeated attacks made them, began waver. Jack, leading his men, struck down, Tom, took his place, wounded left shoulder, still continued head his men. Desmond, mean time, endeavouring throw his hand-grenades. Although burst midst enemy, must wounded several, others springing forward occupied places, nearly score blue jackets killed wounded, Captain Adair obliged retire. Just Jack, stunned bullet grazed his head, inflicting scalp wound, recovered, and, calling his men follow, led assault. Adair, imitating his example, observing palisades shattered hand-grenades, attacked party his men carried axes. While Maoris hurried defend spot thus threatened Adair, Jack Tom, quickly followed _Empress's_ men, mounting ladders, climbed palisades, inside enemy perceived them. Although yet another fortification Maoris might held short time longer, finding overpowered, hoisted white flag sign ready capitulate. The troops advancing support blue-jackets joined shouts hearty cheers victors. Not another shot fired. Several hundred Maoris, many chiefs, laid arms. Some warriors declared saw officer thought killed get lead his men bravely before, time give in. The victory, however, dearly purchased: upwards forty men killed, including four officers, nearly hundred wounded, Maoris must lost much larger number. Two three hundred enemy, unable escape, yielded prisoners war, promising never take arms British. They kindly treated, became good terms soldiers blue-jackets. It curious see mingling men round camp fires, talking broken English, apparently friendly terms late enemies. As totally unarmed, chiefs remained hostages well guarded, fear attempting treachery. A redoubt commenced captured position. Soldiers sailors laboured together construction, latter especially bringing guns, ammunition, stores required garrison. Another important pah, one principal strongholds enemy, interior, attacked. The steamers proceeded river far depth water would allow, troops landed, several bodies blue-jackets different ships, respective officers. Jack his second lieutenant him, Mr Norman, his brother, Billy Blueblazes, sixty men, among Jerry Tim Nolan. Adair accompanied Desmond, his second lieutenant, number men. While main body troops assault pah front, parties sent round attack rear, also cut retreat enemy. Jack secured services guide, friendly native, professed know country, undertook conduct position whence he could observe fort, either move attack it, or, Maoris take flight, capture shoot refused yield. The force destined attack enemy reverse, furthest go, started camp late evening. The men supper, ready amount fatigue might called endure. Tom marched alongside Jack first part distance. There necessity keeping silence, enemy near. "I wish business over," said Tom. "There little honour glory gained. It excessively fatiguing unsatisfactory work." "It done, events," observed Jack. "As honour glory, Maoris despicable foes, fight bravely men do, though always civilised fashion, must allowed. It hoped time discover hopelessness because, sue peace. It sad think many brave officers men already lost lives, enemy holds many more, too, probably killed. I sorry, too, Maoris themselves, who, ignorance power, venture boldly resist it." "It satisfactory, events, find discover hopeless resistance, inclined become friends, shown," observed Tom. The party marching along native path towards south-east. On left hills covered brushwood; right level country, partly wooded, wide open spaces, grew rich profusion tall New Zealand flax. The shades evening gradually closing around. Jack well aware enemy discover advance his party, his position might become critical extreme. He therefore kept his men well together, pushed forward rapidly nature ground darkness would allow. Having proceeded distance, he ordered maintain perfect silence, tread lightly possible, footsteps might heard distance. He sent Tom four men ahead, directing fall back enemy appear. Thus little band marched on, climbing hills, diving valleys, crossing open spaces, making way dense scrub. At length Jack began suspect marched much longer necessary gain desired position. He interrogated guide, who, his replies, showed hesitation, length confessed considerable period elapsed since he come road. "I afraid so," said Jack. "We must look spot encamp daylight, shall able ascertain true position. If march may get beyond pah, late assault." The party small valley, commanded left side wooded hill, whence enemy might fire impunity upon them. The guide asserted risk this, advised Jack advance short time longer, assuring soon reach position he wished gain. He confident his manner Jack allowed continue ahead lead way. As advanced, however, valley narrowed party might assaulted sides. Still, enemy appeared, his belief guide's honesty returned. Again valley opened out; hill appeared left side, sloping gradually valley. Jack determined take possession it, remain daylight. He accordingly sent Tim Nolan Tom, charge guide, directing halt main body came up, he hoped guide would find path hill might ascended. Tim quickly returned, reporting guide disappeared although two Tom's men instantly set pursuit, unable find him. This looked suspicious, made Jack ever anxious get secure position. A path found leading hill. He determined pursue it, though steep narrow, directing men prepared attack, he thought possible hill might possession Maoris. In perfect silence proceeded, two men abreast, path would allow more. At moment might hear crack enemy's rifles, shower bullets might come rattling ears. Still went boldly on. Up ascended among tall trees. It dark see yards ahead; Jack issued orders enemy appear, his men fire volley charge, he little doubt Maoris would give way. The path made several bends avoid steeper portions hill. It might easily defended determined body natives. As none showed themselves, Jack began hope he gain position without fighting. Suddenly looking upwards, he discovered tall trees rising him, directly afterwards he found open space, destitute even brushwood, summit hill. A line palisades, partly broken opposite side, convinced ground site ancient pah village; and, considerable elevation, he hoped daylight, obtaining good view country, ascertain direction he must take. It not, he certain, position he directed occupy, was, he thought, considerable way beyond it. That, however, without guide, could ascertained morning. It secure would spot covered trees, time enemy might steal close without discovered. He therefore saw necessity keeping vigilant look-out. A short time detachment military, long march, halted, become scattered, officers going distance men, Maoris, watch, fell upon them, killed one officers, wounded another, killed wounded upwards dozen men. To avoid like misfortune, Jack kept his men together centre space, placed sentries round. The rest he allowed lie arms sides. As supper marching, hungry. Many cried water, unfortunately none brought. Although moon stars bright, enabled objects seen hill-tops considerable distance. Jack, though he sat down, venture go sleep, keeping his eyes ears open. Occasionally he Tom made circuit ground, stopping every listen, sounds reached ears. "I really do not think enemy discovered us," observed Tom; "or know are, consider hazardous attack us." Jack inclined Tom's opinion; so, directing look-out men keep vigilant watch, retired centre open space, sat close rest people. "It occurred me," said Tom, length, "that guide means treachery, he find Maoris bring body upon us; quite possible may even attacked morning." "I little doubt he intend treachery; he thought, deserting us valley, bivouac were, failing discover hill. If so, Maoris disappointed," answered Jack. "Whether venture attack us find gained position, question." Scarcely half hour passed remarks made, suddenly, amid dark wood every side, bright flashes flame burst forth. The crack rifles heard, bullets came flying men lay. The sentries returned fire. Two next instant seen fall. Had rest men standing up, many must hit. The sound musketry made party spring feet; Jack, directing Mr Norman Tom hold ground half men, led half towards side hill whence firing appeared thickest. As he gained he ordered half fire volley hill, aiming objects could see moving, lie seek cover behind trees. As soon smoke cleared away he caught sight number dark forms advancing hill. "Now time, lads!" he sang out. The men reserve, first half re-loading, fired approaching foe. Several must hit, next instant man seen, evidently sought cover springing behind trees. What described occupied scarcely minute time. Jack forget enemy right left him, might moment gain level ground get rest his party. He therefore thought prudent fall back, intending hold position side hill steepest, might defended men, main body occupied enemy front. His position dangerous extreme. Completely surrounded he apparently large force, he might find difficult hold arrival reinforcements; indeed, question whether would sent him. Before he could get across open space spot he determined hold, enemy appeared, time coming boldly cover trees, firing so. They must somewhat surprised volley received return, must supposed small number men first encountered formed whole party. Still several seamen hit, two poor fellows killed outright. It wanted yet hour dawn, doubtful whether Jack's position would improved daylight. The enemy would able take better aim behind trees his men, exposed open. Had time he would pulled old palisades made breastwork, would afforded protection his people, Maoris got behind palisades fired thence. To attempt leave position would madness. He could hope gain better without pass thick forest, his men would exposed fire almost invisible foe. His chief hope Maoris would discover pah attacked would retreat assist defence. This, however, likely provided great distance fortification. The warm way he received enemy whenever appeared kept check, sometimes, several minutes together, hoped retreated, came on, though must suffered severely. Many seamen would hit Jack made lie rise knees fire. It satisfactory think owing his vigilance his whole party surprised. It evident far out-numbered enemy, still seemed resolved persevere attack. Dawn length broke, daylight increased Jack knew diminished numbers his party would discovered Maoris. For time, however, attack made, could enemy seen. Hopes entertained really retreated. The wounded crying water, distance bottom hill, stream could discerned, Jerry Bird several men volunteered go fetch it. Jack, course, could allow he ascertained whether enemy left neighbourhood. Taking, therefore, dozen men him, he making his way across open examine side hill, hundred dark forms sprang behind brushwood, concealed themselves, opened hot fire his small party. "Give volley return, lads, retreat!" cried Jack. He promptly obeyed three, struck down. He his men rapidly retreated, re-loading went. Seeing occurred, Tom, dozen men, rushed forward succour captain, greatly contributed keep back Maoris, who, seeing retreat first party, begun advance. Jack point giving order whole his party charge, volley fired his rear number enemy climbed steep sides hill, made order men halt deal fresh party foe. Though latter climbed greatest courage, unable avoid exposing themselves. Several shot, rest sprang steep side hill, seeking shelter could find. More seamen wounded, even behind rocks trunks trees Maoris continued fire foot hill sailors exposed themselves. Jack casting look round his diminished band, his grief he saw Tom fall. He sent Jerry Bird ascertain nature his brother's wound. Jerry, stooping down, bound Tom's side, directly afterwards Lieutenant Norman, bravely repelling, half-a-dozen men, another assault side hill, struck head bullet. In short time Bird rejoined him. "Lieutenant Rogers badly hurt, sir; I do not think he mortally wounded, I have managed stop bleeding, he get help doctor I think he will well, I am sorry say, sir, poor Mr Norman done for. He never moved he fell. We have lost good officer, sir." "You speak truth, Bird, I wish would stay Lieutenant Rogers able, defend last, enemy gain hill. We must keep check front. If wounded, would exposed destruction, I would charge drive hill." A short time hard-pressed band left peace, wounded lay ground lifted brought together, small party could defend them. The sun rose, heat, even summit hill, became excessive. The poor wounded fellows cried loudly water. "I think, sir, I might get down, keeping among trees, back couple hats full enemy find out," said Jerry. "I wish, brave fellow, I dare let go," answered Jack. "I feel confident would discovered shot." It tantalising see water glittering distance yet able get it. That Jack right soon shown enemy suddenly appearing. They must observed many seamen already shot down, felt confident ultimate success. They received steady fire before, several killed. Jack last began lose hope escaping, he determined hold man remained alive. He often dangerous positions, time he seen prospect death near his followers. As long his ammunition held out, however, he might still hope keep enemy bay, appeared inclination come close quarters. Scarcely man his party escaped without one bullets pierced his clothes hat, occasion, attacked, several fallen. A longer pause ensued, Maoris, loud shouts, sprang hill, resolved surround overwhelm small party seamen. Jack could help feeling would probably succeed. He, notwithstanding, cheered his men urged deliver fire steadily foe. Just cheer heard bottom hill. The advancing Maoris stopped looked right shoulders. The next instant volley fired among them, brought several ground, rest turned fled away left, many throwing muskets rushed brushwood. In minutes party seamen seen coming hill, Adair Desmond dashed across open meet Jack his men. Their greeting short, Adair considered enemy followed severely punished. Jack advised go far lest he might fall ambush. Happily Adair's party accompanied assistant surgeon, hastened attend wounded. He gave favourable report Tom, whose wound he dressed, well men wounded. The hill cleared enemy, Bird party set obtain water them, all, even unhurt, suffering fearfully thirst. In short time Adair returned, found impracticable force his way bush pursuit enemy. He brought number muskets pouches, showing panic must seized Maoris, evidently fancied whole British force upon them. He, like Jack, lost his way, hearing firing, directed his course spot whence came. From summit hill able glasses distinguish pah intended attack, passed considerable distance. Stretchers made wounded, impossible carry dead, graves dug top hill, bodies interred. As far could judge, attack fort commenced, would still time perform duty assigned them. Jack's people, though hungry weary, mourning shipmates, still eager fight. Taking survey country hill, able select open path come, towards pah, could seen far distance. They course keep bright look-out, send scouts either hand avoid surprise natives rally attack them. They length much relieved falling body troops sent round join assault rear fort. As road river perfectly safe, wounded carried boats conveyed board ships war, could better attended shore. Jack Terence learned officer commanding troops attack pah postponed, still time take part it. They accordingly pushed forward got beyond gunshot, halted, expecting signal opposite side commencing assault. Jack Terence advanced, cover trees, point whence could obtain good survey whole pah glasses. "Very strange!" observed Jack. "I see people moving about, entrenchments." "We must not, however, sure that," answered Terence. "They may show fast enough commence assault." They joined major commanding troops, together settled part works direct chief attack. Scarcely done went signal rocket, hurrying back men led forward, expecting every moment exposed enemy's fire, still black head appeared, gun barrel seen. As soon ground would permit, blue-jackets soldiers advanced double, creating dust completely surrounded them. On reaching palisades seamen began climb over, soldiers axes commenced opening space could force way. Still shot fired. They could see troops side pah engaged similar work, almost moment parties forced entrance. Great surprise disappointment discover space deserted. There could doubt Maoris attacked Jack formed part garrison, finding formidable preparations made destruction, deserted pah, falling retreat, intended revenge attempting cut off. The general resolved attack two important positions south province Auckland, prevented free communication province Taranki. Jack much wished return board _Empress_ ascertain Tom getting on, finding work done, he overcame his fraternal feelings, though Tom's wound caused considerable anxiety. The object occasions throughout warfare waged rebel tribes out-flank take enemy rear. The success movements course depended greatly upon secrecy conducted. The force strengthened three guns, two Armstrong six-pounders, naval six-pounder Terence brought his ship. The tents allowed stand nightfall, signs made British camp troops move. Soon dark, however, tents struck troops paraded without sound bugle, moved silently forward. Among seamen marines landed _Empress_ _Orion_. Jack Terence marched men, dragged along gun, careful way handled it, evidently regarded greatest affection. After marching couple hours, crossing river ford, approached enemy's position, rear necessary get without discovered. So perfect discipline troops sound uttered moved along, Maoris--not dreaming neighbourhood--were heard calling usual evince alertness-- "I see you, ye dogs, come fight! come on!" A low chuckle seamen reply. It intention general attack position, would, supplies cut off, become untenable turned, column, therefore, marched capture large Maori village considerable stores, whole neighbourhood also cultivation. The advance guard consisted body forest rangers, colonial cavalry corps. They followed seamen, who, lightly clad, managed keep them. For several miles marched along path high ferns either side, country beyond completely shut view. By pushing cavalry light troops forward hoped village might surrounded, inhabitants prevented making escape. Whether would attempt defend doubtful. It hoped would see uselessness so, orders issued treat them-- yield--with kindness consideration. Ascending slight elevation, village, covering wide extent ground, could seen, quarter mile away. No lights visible huts, people moving about. Not dog barked-- sound heard. The rangers ordered push forward enter village one side, seamen marines closed other, inhabitants take flight must fall hands troops coming ridge. As seamen advancing, supposing even discovered, suddenly line fire opened range huts front, Maoris running muskets walls. The defenders smaller huts soon disposed of, large hut centre determined resistance made. One seamen got close door, opened he hauled inside his comrades could rescue him. There could little doubt he instantly put death. There nothing hand break door, seamen attempted force entrance, defenders continued fire walls. "We must let fellows keep us back," cried Jack, dashing forward head his men, flames burst forth furiously every part building one could approach it. Not another shot fired; probably defenders exhausted ammunition. Just Jack order his men move attack another part village, door opened tall Maori stalked forth, his blanket his head defend flames. With dignified step he advanced towards Jack, presenting his war axe, he yielded prisoner. No others came out, roof hut directly afterwards fell in. For moment seamen stopped, gazing catastrophe; impulse seized rush forward attempt rescue fellow-creatures, late: instant blackened head rose amidst burning embers, another place arm shoulder appeared, directly sank down. Not groan, sound proceeded building. All within perished, together unfortunate seaman dragged inside. In mean time resistance offered parts village overcome. A hut near centre still remained, however, shots fired assailants. Jack led his men attack it. As door closed fired, knowing bullets would penetrate walls. After first discharge Jack called inmates surrender themselves. A shout defiance reply, followed several shots. Again seamen fired, dashing forward burst open door. No resistance offered. On ground lay stretched four Maoris, still grasping muskets, end sat young girl, supporting her lap head old warrior, shot chest apparently dying. Three men--the remainder garrison--having thrown weapons, stood ready deliver up. As Jack, followed Bird, Nolan, men, approached young girl, she said broken English, pointing old warrior, "He grandfather! Soon die! No hurt him!" "That will not, pretty maiden. I sorry he wounded. We see doctor him." The girl shook her head. Jack saw blood flowing wound old man's breast, came gushing his mouth. He despatched one his men surgeon, old warrior lifted hut, felt hot stifling, hopes fresh air might revive him. The girl followed seated herself ground beside her aged relative. "Sure! is not she beauty!" exclaimed Tim Nolan, assisted carrying old man, stood regarding girl expression admiration his countenance. "If she would me, I would lave sarvice settle beautiful country." "May she would not you, boy," observed Jerry Bird. "If she chief's daughter she will looking officer." Tim gave hitch his trousers. "Though I am officer I am British seaman, mighty deal better looking many officer, disrespect superiors, I do not see Maori girl turn her nose one like me. I will ask captain's lave splice her hand." The surgeon soon arrived pronounced old chiefs wound mortal; indeed, many minutes elapsed he breathed his last. The poor girl inconsolable. Her mother, she said, dead, her father gone defend pah supposed would attacked British. Jack promised protect her best his power. She seemed inclined trust him. He greatly puzzled, however, act, Tim, made offer "splice her forthwith," way relieved him. While Jack dilemma surgeon suggested missionary, accompanied forces interpreter, would best person consign her. The excellent man, appealed to, gladly undertook task, promising send her his station, she would looked his wife chiefs' daughters age. Whether young lady pleased arrangement, difficult say. She overcome grief death her relative, she still seen every give way tears. Poor Tim despair. "I told so," observed Jerry Bird. "She is young lady born, though she is rigged silks furbelows, she is me. If wise man you will wait English Irish girl, though she may cock-up nose, weigh three times much young beauty, she will make far better wife." The expedition successful. The strong posts Maoris captured, inhabitants whole part country sent submission, seamen marines able return ships. Jack Terence, this, engaged several expeditions shore, which, though successful, several officers large number men lost lives. At length Maoris discovered, might known first, instigated knavish foes England, kept well background, useless contend power Britain. Most rebel chiefs losing heart, tendered submission, promised future faithful subjects Queen Victoria. The regular forces consequently withdrawn, protection provinces left care colonial troops. Jack Terence, greatly satisfaction officers crews, received orders return home. They agreed, far able, keep together, although would opportunities communicating, except signal. They course proceed sail, except event continued calms, would put steam. They filled bunkers coal Auckland, hoped avoid necessity touching Rio, place fuel. The _Empress_ taking lead, two men-of-war steamed together Auckland harbour, when, gained good offing fair breeze springing up, sail made stood together homeward course. Tom Rogers, completely recovered, able resume his duty. Though he often made Billy Blueblazes his butt, he sincere regard midshipman, placed his watch. He one night, soon leaving New Zealand, walking deck, full moon shone even usual brilliancy, he missed Billy. Leaving poop he walked forward, he found he slipped his back leaning bulwarks, behind gun, fast asleep his eyes open. "Well, Billy, sort night it?" he asked. Billy, starting up, rubbed his eyes. "Very dark, sir; I have looking time, see nothing." Tom somewhat astonished answer. "What is matter you?" he asked. "I do not like suppose asleep, look like it." "Oh, no, sir," answered Billy. "I never go sleep I help it, events duty. It dark night, although time ago I know moon shining brightly." "You must joking," said Tom; "why moon shining brightly ever I saw life." "On word, I cannot see thing else," answered Billy. "It seems I ten minutes deck." Just struck seven bells first watch. Again poor Billy rubbed his eyes. "I am sorry, I have asleep I did not know it," he said, putting his hands instinctively him. "Do know, I am afraid I am blind." "I much fear are," said Tom. "I will send you would better turn doctor see morning; maybe eyes little dazzled now, rights time." Tom called another midshipman directed help Billy his hammock let know he was. From way poor Billy walked, evident he could see inch his nose, although, he got his feet hatchway ladder, he easily made his way his hammock. He felt about, however, place his clothes, required assistance turning in. When there, he heaved deep sigh. His messmates heard murmur, "Oh, dear me! I going blind life?" "I hope Billy, Mr Rogers says he thinks struck moon-blindness, sleeping eyes open, gazing long Dame Luna. You would got precious scrape happened. I suppose Mr Rogers will not report now." Again Billy groaned. He much rather reported punished lost his sight, he supposed case. As soon Tom's watch over, he came see Billy, still groaning thoughts lost his sight. Tom think matters serious. Intending comfort Billy, he told consideration happened, captain would severe him. Billy last groaned sleep. He awoke daylight. All dark ever, but, though he began groan again, he soon dropped sleep. At last he aroused hearing hammocks piped up. He instinctively tumbled his, his surprise find he could see well ever, though his eyes ached little, he felt uncomfortable smarting them. He hastily dressed went deck. The discovery he could see threw high spirits. He began tell every one his wonderful recovery. In short time doctor heard happened, called hear examine his eyes. "I do not wish damp spirits, must sure retaining sight," observed surgeon. Still Billy would believe this, perfectly satisfied he right. At night, however, his disappointment when, directly sun set, he became blind led his hammock. In vain doctor applied remedies--none slightest effect. Poor Billy impression he leave service without chance becoming one England's admirals, even obtaining his lieutenancy. The two ships, still keeping company, long spell fine weather, length one evening came blow hard. The wind increased night, following day terrific storm thunder lightning burst ship. The _Orion_, hitherto kept company, lost sight off. The thunder rolled rattled, flash succeeded flash, vivid first. Several times appeared ship herself would struck, forked lightning, bursting mass dark clouds above, went zig-zagging summits waves. It Tom's watch. Billy, who, day time, could duty well ever, deck, indeed officers, come witness terrific strife elements. Billy standing himself, flash, darting air, passed close appeared he struck. It seen flash across deck lose foaming ocean. Billy uttered cry put his hands his eyes. Tom asked anything happened. He answered, "No, lightning looked bright. I thought I struck." The gale continued. No one thought leaving deck. Night came on, yet Billy remained moving he done several weeks past. "Why, Billy, seem, able see way well ever," said Tom, observed him. "So I do; although, flashes, night dark enough, I make objects well I ever could." Though gale continued, thunderstorm blew midnight, Billy, rest watch below, turned in. The next evening he found his infinite satisfaction his moon blindness longer existed, doctor pretended scientific knowledge, opinion cured electric fluid, glanced across his face. "Another half-inch, however, might different tale tell you," observed doctor. "How so?" inquired Billy. "Why, would turned piece charcoal, instead restored sight. There something think of, boy, rest days." A look-out kept _Orion_. Although gale ceased, horizon clear, she nowhere seen. "I hope they have killing pig aboard," remarked Pat. "They may get cheap have." "What mean?" asked Tim Nolan. "Why, tell, one zig-zag flashes may struck her, sent her Davy's locker, fired her magazine blown her sky high." "I hope that is Captain Adair's fate," observed Jerry Bird. "I have sailed many day, better officer nicer gentleman command one her Majesty's ships. When I shore him, he kind friendly like, looked interests his men, seeing plenty grub got. Never made us work necessity it, I sorry indeed harm happened him." When, however, day day went by, _Orion_ seen, even Jack began feel somewhat anxious. She likely gone ahead _Empress_, faster ship two, could she dropped far astern altogether sight short time. Still, Jack observed Tom, "They often, early days, inclined give lost, always met again," he still hoped would case. At last, however, shores Old England appeared sight, he began dread tell his sister Lucy his anxiety her husband. Proceeding Channel, Spithead reached, _Empress_ immediately received orders go harbour paid off. Jack wisely, writing his wife, who, Lucy, staying Lady Rogers', speak his anxiety Adair, merely said he parted sea hoped _Orion_, proved herself rather slower ship _Empress_, would soon make her appearance Spithead. Murray Stella, children, were, he learned, Bercaldine, he sorry, he thought he might satisfaction meeting south. Some days must elapse he could pay his ship; he fully expected Julia Lucy would forthwith come elder girls Southsea, though he felt much inclined advise wait. Tom glad find Archie Gordon promoted year, serving Channel squadron, he likely fall long. As Jack expected, scarcely two days passed since _Empress_ dropped anchor, Julia Lucy arrived Southsea, little girl, image mothers. Jack happiness hearing little Jack born months he left England, grown fine chubby fellow, small Lucy image her mamma, still young Jack his papa. Poor Lucy began look sorrowful, day day went by, _Orion_ appear. CHAPTER FOURTEEN. A VISIT TO THE GRAVE OF AN OLD FRIEND--THE THREE OLD SHIPMATES MEET-- DESMOND IN IRELAND--LAYS CLAIM TO A TITLE AND ESTATE--THE POST CAPTAINS TAKE TO YACHTING--CRUISES ON BOARD THE STELLA--A NAVAL REVIEW--DOWN CHANNEL--A GALE--A RUN UP THE IRISH SEA--DUBLIN REACHED--GERALD DESMOND HAS BECOME VISCOUNT SAINT MAUR--PLEASANT EXCURSIONS ROUND DUBLIN-- COUNSELLOR MCMAHON AND HIS FAIR DAUGHTERS--THE STELLA AGAIN SAILS, WITH LORD SAINT MAUR ON BOARD--BECALMED IN THE CHOPS OF THE ENGLISH CHANNEL-- THE YACHT RUN DOWN BY A BIG SHIP--SAINT MAUR DISAPPEARS--ANXIETY AS TO HIS FATE--DANGEROUS CONDITION OF THE YACHT--FALMOUTH REACHED--DICK STOKES GIVES AN ACCOUNT OF THE COLLISION--RETURN TO RYDE--THE STELLA SAILS NORTHWARD--JACK APPOINTED TO THE BELLONA, ADAIR TO THE EMPRESS. Two gentlemen, might glance known naval officers, walking arm-in-arm towards church midst burial ground, standing summit hill surrounded woods Isle Wight, overlooking Solent. The trees green bright leaves early summer, birds flew there, carrying food young, chirping merrily. In several places openings cut, affording view blue water Channel direction Calshot Castle towards Spithead entrance Portsmouth harbour. One gentlemen strongly built, middle height, open, well-bronzed countenance, grey hairs showing amid his bushy whiskers, proving he getting life. The tall slender proportions, equally air bearing son ocean. Passing though wicket gate, went along well-kept gravel path, stopped two monuments, side side, one granite, white marble. On first, surmounted naval crown, engraved--"To memory Admiral Triton;" inscribed name Deborah Triton, daughter late Captain Triton, RIGHT NOW, sister Admiral Triton, lies interred her side. At little distance followed two ladies, party girls boys, laughing, chatting, joking, ran among other, skipping jumping, darting there. Their voices were, however, hushed approached wicket gate discovered arrived churchyard. "I am glad directions carried out," said Captain Adair, taller two gentlemen. "It poor mark, all, gratitude affection I owe kind old friends, I largely benefited. What think them, Jack?" "They much taste, exactly I wished put up," answered Captain Rogers. "We shall hear Julia Lucy say." Their two wives, arrived, equally pleased. The elder girls, brought wreaths flowers, placed graves token visit--an idea mothers, though probable neither Jack Terence would thought thing. They still looking monuments carriage wheels heard, gentleman lady soon afterwards appeared side churchyard, approached them, accompanied fine-looking lad midshipman's uniform. "Why, Murray! My dear fellow! I little expected see here!" exclaimed Jack, hurrying forward greet them, Adair following. Captain Murray introduced his son, left _Britannia_, expected every day appointed ship. "But come from, staying?" asked Jack. "From Bercaldine, board _Stella_, _Stella_ know. Our family considerably increased, outgrown old craft, I purchased fine schooner Greenock, aboard arrived yesterday evening. Finding staying Ryde, went house heard gone direction. Guessing object, drove hopes meeting you." This course gave Jack Terence wives greatest satisfaction. Thus three old shipmates united, together stood round grave friend known youth upwards. Of course great deal talk about, Murray, sending away his carriage, walked back his friends Ryde. Young Alick, may supposed, made agreeable Miss Julia Rogers Miss Lucy Adair--for girls christened mothers. He fine handsome boy, full life spirits, without particle bashfulness. Murray inquired Tom Desmond. Tom sea board _Roarer_, lately launched composite frigate, expected perform wonders sail steam, she already put back twice Plymouth broken-down machinery injuries. It hoped, however, she undergone thorough repair, she would events able keep water, although she might succeed running smaller enemy, running away big one. "And nephew Desmond?" asked Murray. "In Dublin, closeted every day, he writes word, lawyer, poring papers, writing receiving letters, seeing witnesses. Our friend McMahon assures he certain ultimately succeed his father's relative, Viscount Saint Maur, fifth, sixth, seventh cousin, I believe, died lately. Several persons, however, laid claim title estates, McMahon somehow induced look case, became convinced Gerald rightful heir. I thought better he sea unsettle his mind holding great prospect success." "I heartily hope he succeed," said Jack. "He fine young fellow; although he particularly distinguished service, I am sure he will, he opportunity. I hope he will stick even although he become Viscount Saint Maur." "I am confident his that, even Lords Admiralty offer promote him," said Terence, laughing. "He may possibly imitate example old school-fellow, Johnny Grant, mate eight ten years, when, his coming title, lords wrote, offering promote appoint ship. He politely replied, though hitherto overlooked, he bound thank them, declined noble offer. I suspect Gerald also prefer remaining home looking his property, probably taking wife." "Not one Australian friends?" asked Jack. "I did not think he far gone that." "Oh no; he heart-sound ever, Irishman title good property likely allowed remain single blessedness. If he gains his trial, come shortly, I hope he come pay us visit old house undergoing repairs; shall probably go stay winter. I wish Murray would come see us Ballymacree--including, course, Mrs Murray Mrs Rogers belongings. We place put rights, I have bought back dirty acres surrounding poor father let slip his fingers, regained pristine greatness glory, although intend carry custom days yore, half-a-dozen hogsheads claret tap once, anybody asked got key." The young ladies were, perhaps, quite much interested account Adair gave his nephew parents, prospect seeing future viscount. Murray feared he unable visit Ballymacree. "We due Bercaldine autumn," he observed. "We unwilling disappoint people there, always look forward return, many years absent like remain away oftener necessary." "You will getting flag soon," observed Adair. "Then appointment offered you, surely would wish decline it. It time Jack I become admirals, although I shall scarcely feel neglected I get ship. In mean time, I paid several visits Admiralty lately ascertain ocular demonstration prospects, and, judging appearances, bad may supposed. By calculations, flag couple years outside." "How that?" asked Mrs Murray. "Why, I tell you. Your husband, well Rogers, well knows waiting-room officers ushered, desire pay respects First Lord Admiralty, obtain anything him. When I see number old post-captains collected, I generally drop remark I come ask employment, inquire soon I likely obtain flag. Some one sure think I am cracked, beg I say I possibly learn that? My reply I watch way seniors go upstairs. If run nimbly summoned, I pretty sure likely remain books long I am, become admirals. But drag legs them, ascend slow pace, I feel certain placed retired list, perhaps go world altogether. On hearing respected seniors generally cast angry looks me; summoned I follow out. The first steps go nimbly enough, fourth fifth drag legs slower. Before sight I see creeping on, often blowing like grampuses unusual exertion made. I generally pull watch too, time them, making note also mode progress. In nine cases ten I found I right. Since idea first occurred fifty least gone list." Mrs Murray looked somewhat grave. "I rather Alick remained captain see number officers put aside die make room him," she answered. "Why, dear Mrs Murray, it is look to," answered Terence. "We must grow old, it is certain; wish become admirals laid gout, become decrepit go sea. I hear Admiralty taking matter consideration, intend increase retired list, juvenile captains may better chance flags." Jack Terence accompanied Murray Stella pier, boat waiting take yacht, lay among several fine craft short distance it. Both promised go board wives children next morning. "Have got Ben Snatchblock master?" asked Jack. "No, no," said Murray, laughing. "He modestly declined taking responsible charge, I thought he right, he subsided retiring character boatswain second mate. I brought craft round myself, I intend look Cowes man first mate pilot, I wish anxieties, able send vessel anywhere I wish, without going her. I propose engaging couple good men master mate, found season year. Most well-known men are, course, already engaged." Next morning Jack Terence, belongings, went pier, _Stella's_ boat, young Alick, waiting receive oars air. Young Alick gave word shove officer-like way, blades dropping flat water, scarcely making splash, boat rapid strokes pulled alongside yacht. Even Jack's critical eye she neat trim craft could be, and, moreover, thoroughly comfortable, wholesome vessel, Scotch yachts. Captain Murray stood gangway hand his guests, soon seated easy camp chairs, cloaks cushions round skylight. The anchor hove up. The vessel's head, her jib foresail, payed round light air eastward, mainsail hoisted, she stood away several yachts, got way time, standing westward. The sky blue clear, sun shone brightly glittering water, rippled breeze, polished sides yacht, burnished brass work, sails white snow. As _Stella's_ squaresail set, she ran several yachts, showing that, although comfortable craft, she laggard. Every thing board perfect. The men white duck trousers, blue shirts, hats band name yacht inscribed gold letters, decks without spot, ropes neatly flemished down, bulwarks pale salmon colour, stanchions, belaying-pins, brass work burnished nicety, betokened thoroughly well-ordered yacht, Murray setting example his person. The yacht soon glided wooded heights Binsted. The royal domain Osborne, surrounded trees, green lawn, passed, Cowes Point rounded, harbour opened full yachts every size rig, anchor, others getting way. Its club house picturesque villas, amid groves trees bright lawns, seen close port side; opposite shore, mouth Southampton Water, could distinguished Calshot Castle, residence general well known Peninsular War, predecessor command British army Sir Arthur Wellesley. Beyond Calshot rose tower Eaglehurst, west it, reaching shore, outskirts New Forest. Then could seen town Lymington, end river meandering mud flats, Jack-in-the-basket mouth; Isle Wight shore village Newton, peeping amongst thick foliage, line downs rising far beyond it, extending extreme west island; Yarmouth, long street sturdy little castle one end, church tower rising midst; Freshwater, attractive-looking residences, perched hillside; west it, formidable unpicturesque-looking forts, scientifically placed heights commanding entrance Solent. On right, end long spit sand, red light-houses, castle, newly erected batteries Hurst, hostile fleet would dare encounter; outside could distinguished, broken water, dangerous shoal Shingles, well marked also huge black buoys. "How beautiful curious cliffs coloured!" exclaimed children chorus, pointing bay Isle Wight shore, short distance inside white Needle rocks. "That Alum Bay," answered Captain Murray. "The cliffs composed fine sand different colours, see. You shall land day, come purpose; collect specimens museum. There tints sufficient forming picture, may try produce prettiest landscape them." Beyond Alum Bay cliffs rose great height, continuing end island, white Needle rocks ran blue waters. The northern one scarped form platform, granite light-house built, instead one downs, which, frequently shrouded mists, seen thick weather vessels entering westward. The Needle rocks soon rounded, tide still ebbing, Scratchel's Bay opened out, perpendicular cliff rising sheer water several hundred feet. The pilot Murray engaged narrated upon time transport dark night ran rocks, crew passengers escaped fallen masts, succeeded scrambling accessible part cliff; morning broke white rocks looked sprinkled lady-birds, soldiers red jackets attempted make way summit. The yacht stood Christchurch Head passed, Bournemouth, peeping amid pine groves, Studland Bay, pretty little town Swanage appeared, she hauled her wind save tide back, light breeze she would require every inch reach Ryde nightfall. The ladies, never sailed Solent before, delighted scenery. Even three captains, often come Needle passage, declared enjoyed views ever done before. The sea smooth necessity bring luncheon, dinner-time _Stella_ inside Isle Wight. It first several pleasant trips three old friends young people took board _Stella_. The captains declared felt like boys again, happiest time lives. They picnics Alum Bay, Netley Abbey, shores Southampton Water; pulled Beaulieu River boats, several times sailed round Isle Wight. Adair received letter his nephew Gerald, giving hopeful account his prospects. "What say trip round Dublin congratulate he succeeds, console poor fellow he fails?" said Murray. "You come, I sure, I dare say Jack objection trip." Both Adair Jack perfectly ready accept invitation. Mrs Rogers expressed her readiness, Lucy undertook remain Ryde look children. It finally settled eldest Miss Murray Miss Rogers go yacht, with, course, young Alick, rest remained behind. It arranged _Stella_ sail soon grand review fleet, take place, over. The review honour visit paid Queen Sultan Turkey Pasha Egypt, rather exhibit Britannia's might power two Eastern potentates. Murray invited several friends his own, well Jack's Adair's, see fleet. As soon board, _Stella_ got way, making sail ran two lines, one composed lofty line-of-battle ships frigates, relics days gone by, consisting _Victory_, _Duke Wellington_, _Donegal_, _Revenge_, _Saint Vincent_, _Royal George_, _Saint George_, _Dauntless_, many others, whose names recalled proudest days England's glory, probably three four times size old ships, weight metal immensely surpassing predecessors. In line cupola turret-ships; iron-clads, four five huge guns, armoured screw frigates, screw corvettes, rams--hideous look at, formidable monsters--and gun-boats innumerable, like huge beetles turned backs, single gun capable dealing destruction proudest ancient line-of-battle ships. The fleet getting way stood eastward, formed perfect order, sailing ships taking port line, iron-clads starboard. The _Stella_, stood back Spithead, saw approaching, presenting magnificent spectacle gradually emerged broad wreaths smoke issuing funnels. "Gaze yonder sight, ladies gentlemen; probably last time see ancient modern fleets Great Britain placed juxtaposition. All magnificent three-deckers cut turret-ships, _Royal Sovereign_ treated, broken useless, unable contend smallest gun-boat afloat." Jack heaved deep sigh he spoke, adding, "I cannot help wishing times things remained were, smoke-jacks iron-clads, rams torpedoes, diabolical inventions never thought of; must take make best use power. In next naval war, whenever takes place, extraordinary naval events recorded. Instead stately ships light frigates, white canvas reaching skies, ocean covered low black monsters, darting seeking antagonists, others ramming, sending vile torpedoes beneath enemy's keel; others thundering away monster guns; blowing foundering hands board." "You draw pleasant picture battles future," observed Adair, laughing. "My idea British fleet kept be, enemy venture attack it." A strong south-westerly gale kept _Stella_ Cowes harbour days, weather clearing, promising continue fine, she sailed northerly breeze Channel. By time ladies got well accustomed yacht felt perfectly home. Murray good supply books, box Mudie's added store, creature comforts sorts board. "After all, though somewhat closer packed board line-of-battle ship, I must say yachting mighty pleasant way spending time," exclaimed Adair. "Lucy, I suspect, well content satisfied indulging nautical propensities way, instead going afloat three four long years," observed Julia. "It is well think future. If Lords Admiralty insist taking command ship, unless I make mind give service, I must accept offer. However, present, know find me, I likely hear matter, even offer ship, let us happy can, drive dull care away." The fine weather continued _Stella_ got westward Eddystone, came blow pretty hard southward. Murray proposed running Falmouth sake ladies. "Will danger continue voyage?" asked his wife. "Not slightest; utmost need expect summer gale, though may heavy sea doubling Lizard, round fair wind us," answer. The ladies unanimous desire keep sea, yacht stood her course. They certainly repent resolve beacon Wolf Rock appeared starboard hand, gale came redoubled force, heavy sea got up, often chops Channel experienced cost. The ladies, however, showed shadow fear. The yacht behaved beautifully. Murray knew he could trust her spars rigging, Ben superintended fitting vessel, set shroud stay, carefully examined every inch her masts yards, he felt confident flaw existed. In short time helm put yacht stood passage Land's End Scilly Isles, guided two magnificent lights, Longships starboard bow light vessel Seven Stones port. "Why, I expected terrible night it; suddenly gale gone down!" exclaimed Julia, aware yacht put wind, she ladies seated sofas luxurious cabin. The yacht, instead heeling she hitherto doing, tolerably even keel, though she gave little playful roll pitch seas she rapidly clove her way them. Jack came invited come deck see two lights, appeared bow. "Before light vessel port bow stationed there, ship dark night bad weather would willingly run channel," he observed. "But done safely broadest daylight, indeed even so." "But I see two lights close together," said Julia. "Yes," answered Jack, "one mast-head vessel. It thus distinguished larger light Longships, single light much greater power. We also thus distinguish Longships revolving light Saint Agnes, southern rocks Scilly. You see low port quarter. Now see hidden, appear another minute, whereas Longships light fixed always visible." As Murray prognosticated, wind moderated, _Stella_ pleasant run across mouth Bristol Channel, sighting Smalls light-house next forenoon westward Milford Haven starboard hand, revolving Tuscar lights Irish coast seen port quarter grew dark. The wind fell, next morning light breeze spring up, wafted _Stella_ along Wicklow coast. Just dark she brought beautiful Bay Dublin, wind allowing her get Kingstown harbour. Adair especially anxious go shore learn fared Desmond, boat manned, Jack accompanied shore, ladies preferring remain board. The eventful day trial over, already decided whether Gerald Desmond remain poor lieutenant his half-pay alone depend upon, become owner handsome estate--albeit somewhat encumbered--and possessor title, events worth something, whatever cynics might think matter. Jack felt almost much interested Adair, could talk nothing else passage Dublin. The crew seemed guess something wind, gave way will. On arriving Dublin, sent boat back yacht, hastened residence Counsellor McMahon, Desmond staying. They intended sleep night Dublin, return next morning way Kingstown _Stella_. Captain Adair, excited his feelings, pulled bell his usual vehemence. "Is Counsellor McMahon home?" he asked. "No, honour, master, lieutenant, out, they will long they are home," answer. Adair thought term lieutenant augured ill. Surely servant would speak Desmond young lord he gained his because. He, however, considered would undignified put question. "Are family home?" asked Jack, he Adair tendered cards. "Sure, yes, capt'ns; mistress young ladies home, they will mighty glad see ye." "Take cards, events," said Adair, "and wait hall." The servant hurried off, Jack Adair stood waiting his return. The man soon returned. "Come up, come up, capt'ns; mistress mighty pleased see you," he said, beginning, way English servant would thought doing, relieve hats. "Sure, I will take charge these; they will incommoding drawing-room," he said, taking possession beavers gentle force. Adair smiled, made objection, although Jack unwilling give his hat. They ushered handsome drawing-room, lady house--a buxom dame--came smiling forward, three young damsels rose put work engaged. "The Counsellor must good hope success, he would scarcely invited young lieutenant remain his house three attractive girls are," thought Jack, he cast glance young ladies, he advanced across room. Mrs McMahon received Irish cordiality begged seated. "I am expecting counsellor back every moment, I conclude young friend, Lord Saint Maur, return him; I may call Lieutenant Desmond, technicalities gone he properly assume title." "Has he really gained because?" exclaimed Adair. "I delighted, grateful Counsellor McMahon, without whose aid he would chance success." "The counsellor done his best, his success afforded much satisfaction one else," answered lady, bowing. "Indeed, pleasure service excellent delightful young man nephew, Captain Adair." Jack looked round see whether young ladies gave responsive looks encomiums passed Gerald. They three smiled sweetly, precisely expression, would required better physiognomist Captain Rogers discovered passing innocent minds. "I fully believe counsellor disinterested efforts he made forward Desmond's because," he thought himself. There much time conversation Counsellor McMahon, round, ruddy-faced, white-haired, bright-eyed man, accompanied Desmond, entered room. He took Adair's hand his shook cordially, saying hearty tone-- "I congratulate you, dear captain, nephew's success." "Oh, do not thank me; I merely took care justice done--that is lawyer do, his client's point view events. We triumphed, I knew should, notwithstanding forgeries, falsehood, perjury brought array us. It truly satisfaction fight nephew, bore his blushing honours much equanimity. I believe he lost, he would gone sea done his duty much zeal ever. Whether he return tempt tempest waves, speak round shot bullets, I say. I know I his place I stick _terra firma_. But I never much admired life ocean wave, albeit feeling deepest respect gallant sons hazard lives country's because." The lawyer ran on, scarcely allowing Jack Adair get word. At last, however, opportunity congratulating Desmond his good fortune. He spoke sensibly, evidently way unduly elated his success. Jack rightly thought he busy dream making love lawyer's fair daughters, attractive one were. In minutes supper announced, Jack, senior officer, handed lady house, Desmond modestly slipping behind refusing move. Mrs McMahon affability itself, counsellor brimful jokes good humour, laughing talking everybody else. On hearing Jack Adair part families board, he insisted come shore, allow his wife show lions Dublin neighbourhood. "You will going away without taking drive Wicklow, perfect paradise surface globe opinion," he added. "Carriages shall waiting ladies, I will take trouble hands." So pressing invitation refused. The various excursions Mrs McMahon her friends made shore need described. They delighted saw country, Dublin Misses Murray declared perfectly ready come live Ireland, though seen spot could equal Bercaldine. As Captain Murray return Ryde take board his younger children, returning Scotland, his stay Dublin could prolonged. "We give berth, Saint Maur, inclined take trip sea again, although make keep watch unless specially wish it," he said, scarcely expecting, however, invitation would accepted. "I shall delighted," answered Desmond; "I spare couple weeks, McMahon immediately require signature necessary mean time. I feel fond sea ever, though I shall certainly seek employment, may possibly retire start yacht next year I afford it, although score I sanguine, old house, I understand, requires extensive repairs, much done estate: decent cottages, instead pigsties, built; land drained fences put up--the tenantry must looked after." Murray, way returning attentions he received Counsellor McMahon, took him, his wife, daughters, trip board _Stella_, cruise along Wicklow coast, highly delighted young ladies were, though counsellor acknowledged he much happier _Stella_ brought Kingstown Harbour, he found dinner table comfortable cabin perfect rest. "It may pleasant young people tumbled tossed gazing scenery incomparable mountains, I confess I enjoy beauties nature I find feet securely placed _terra firma_," he remarked. The following day, spanking breeze westward, _Stella_ sailed her return Isle Wight. The fine weather continued she got clear Scilly. While she still chops Channel fell dead calm, thick fog came on. There _Stella_ lay, drifted slowly one tide westward other. Night came on. The officers agreed never Channel perfect darkness hung water. Lights hoisted, look-out kept steamers might coming Channel, although get way impossible. Captain Murray his friends felt far anxiety would experienced blowing strong gale. The evening unusually chilly. Moisture dropped sails rigging, preventing ladies remaining deck. Adair went below, he said, amuse them; Murray, Jack, Desmond remained looking out, ready shout see steamer approaching. Of sailing vessels fear, they, _Stella_, would becalmed. "Oh, horrible steam-kettles! I never heartily hated I now. If one come thundering along now, without bright look-out, she might us lights could seen, warning shouts heard!" exclaimed Adair. "Yes, indeed," answered Murray. "I am almost inclined get ladies deck boat lowered, case steamer run us. We better hope saving lives, sides yacht ill able withstand blow steamer going even moderate speed; steam-boat skippers, provided make fast passage, care little damage may small craft way." Murray, however, kept fast. He felt ashamed making preparations catastrophe might never occur. Hour hour passed by, paced deck hands pockets, whistling breeze. It trying, hurry get back. "You better go below, Saint Maur," said Murray; "there necessity us remain deck." "Thank you; I would rather assist keeping look-out, either Captain Rogers turn in. I will keep moving, though, I feel rather cold;" Desmond continued walking quick pace. Captain Rogers last said he would go see ladies about, advise turn in. Scarcely his head descended companion hatch Murray exclaimed-- "Here is breeze last! Its dead ahead though; blow away fog, I hope, shall able keep yacht moving." Two three minutes, however, passed vessel's sails, feeling influence wind, enabled her gather way. Contrary Murray's expectations, fog still hung thickly water. "Here, Murray, ladies want settle knotty point," exclaimed Jack, foot companion ladder. Murray, seeing schooner got way her, dived below. Not minute after, crash heard. He, followed Jack, sprang deck, saw large dark hull, pyramid canvas, rising deck, part long projecting bowsprit made rapid sweep, tearing hole mainsail, carrying away leech. They instinctively sprang aft helm, man knocked down. In another instant schooner clear, stranger disappeared darkness. Jack, taking helm, kept up, blow brought vessel wind, Murray hastened ascertain damage done. "She torn away bulwarks, sir," cried Ben. "Try well," said Murray. Ben reported-- "She is making water, I do not know she may go t'other tack." "Clear boats ready lowering," exclaimed Murray. That port side, however, found carried away, davits, hung crushed pieces, held falls. The darkness prevented damage done discovered time. Adair remained minute behind his friends, quiet alarm ladies, naturally somewhat agitated hearing sound caused collision. He sprang deck, Murray ordering boat lowered. "Here, Desmond," he sang out, "lend hand falls." "Hold on!" cried Murray; "there is necessity lowering boat. There is great damage done, all, I hope; though would big fellow, one board even hailed know whether required assistance." The breeze every instant freshening. The schooner heeled starboard. "Where you, Desmond?" exclaimed Adair. No one answered. "Good Heavens! where is Saint Maur?" cried Jack. "Can he gone below?" "That is likely. Alick, you?" cried Captain Murray, fearful idea occurring accident might happened his son. "Here, sir," cried Alick, forward talking Ben Snatchblock. Murray uttered his thanks Heaven. "Bring light here, look round deck," he exclaimed. "He may struck down." The search vain. The man helm seemed seriously injured, he found senseless close taffrail. It became sadly evident young lord carried overboard. He must struck head; cry heard, and, owing pitchy darkness, one seen him. The crew, exception helmsman, gathered forward, mustered ascertain one else carried overboard, answered names. Murray Jack blamed bitterly left deck ought look-out; even remained, collision might avoided, suddenly stranger appeared running wind. Adair could scarcely restrain his grief loss his nephew. Murray immediately put schooner about, kept away, pass spot accident occurred. Desmond might possibly recovered his senses, kept afloat, either swimming holding fragments boat. Every eye strained looking ahead sides, possibility discovering him; voice replied repeated shouts, nothing seen floating water. Hands stationed falls lower boat, become necessary. The schooner frequently tacked, every inch water explored; search vain. Murray considered would useless attempt overtake stranger, ascertain she was, demand reparation damage inflicted. At length search abandoned hopeless; yacht hauled her wind. She destined, appearance, long beat Channel. Jack undertook convey sad intelligence his wife Mrs Murray, remained below, wondering occurred. It sad event trip, otherwise agreeable. The wind continued increase, Murray felt anxious go below. The schooner put standing northward. He made his mind run Falmouth wait fair wind, weather improve. Ben Snatchblock came aft. "I am afraid, sir, craft's making water she should. We will man pumps, please. She got damage I supposed. The chief injury seems amidships, I surprised water was not coming one side berths." Jack Adair went examine state affairs. One berths port side occupied Desmond. On entering it, light main cabin, saw water gushing every time schooner heeled over. The ladies naturally cried alarm. "It might far worse," said Jack. "We soon stop this. We must shorten sail keep much possible even keel." The carpenter came tools planks, set work try stop leak. The pumps were, mean time, kept actively going, Ben reported water decreasing. Still, injury might serious first apprehended, little anxiety felt board. It might many hours Falmouth could reached. The damage partially repaired, yacht put about. The leak side anxiously watched, ascertain water still came in. A small quantity evidently forcing way seams, Murray hoped would prove much consequence, pumps might easily keep vessel clear. Still he aware moment plank nailed might forced in. It seemed wonder indeed yacht sunk blow she received. "The wind's coming point two south'ard, sir," observed Ben Snatchblock, looking binnacle. "Half point more, shall weather Lizard. There lights, sir. I thought see long." The mist clearing away, fixed lights Lizard seen port bow. Gradually wind allowed vessel's head turned eastward, appeared broad bow. The schooner, keeping close wind, able steer course direct Falmouth Harbour, away she went slashing seas great rate. Just dawn grew unusually dark thick, even bright lights Lizard could seen dimly. They served, however, show she sufficient distance shore, shore lee one, accident happen, she would placed great peril. "Luff can," said Murray helmsman, he naturally dreaded, wind increase, find rocky coast his lee, though he confidence his craft. Day dawned, Cornish land appeared stretching along north south, much nearer supposed. Breakers seen dashing dangerous rocks Manacles, close lee. Just heavy squall struck yacht; she heeled, water rushed half her deck, pouring crevices hitherto discovered. To keep her away impossible. By luffing she ran risk getting wind. To shorten sail would equally hazardous. She must stand risks. The yacht flew water, plunging seas like struggling life. Falmouth Harbour appeared directly ahead, Saint Anthony's light-house east side entrance. In short time vessel would safe. She shot close buoy Manacles. Murray knew placed distance outside rocks. He drew his breath he saw astern; still one looking would suspected anxiety weighed his heart. By keeping pumps going water gain sufficiently much alarm, _Stella_ already her hold pleasant, her stores, events, likely suffer. Murray infinitely relieved he able let go anchor, yacht rode safely beautiful harbour Falmouth, among numerous craft, various rig size. The vessel rest, water soon pumped out, and, breakfast over, Murray Adair went shore obtain carpenter capable thoroughly repairing damages vessel received, also ascertain whether she received injury water. Meantime Ben engaged mending mainsail. The ladies feel disposed go shore. They were, fortunately, fully aware danger yacht placed, much confidence her ever. The carpenter his assistants set work without delay, and, wonderful relate, undertook damages repaired following day. A doctor also sent attend poor Dick Stokes, remained senseless since he taken below. After treatment, however, he recovered sufficiently speak give account he recollected moment he saw stranger gliding stem towards _Stella's_ beam. "She seemed coming fog, like big ice mountain, I thought us," he said. "I would time put helm down, hoping scrape clear her, I heard crash saw her bowsprit come sweeping along deck, tearing away luff mainsail knocking port quarter-boat pieces. I thought I saw one hanging her bobstay, next moment something else struck head shoulders, I thought I going overboard. It seemed I heard cry, whether shout one else's I tell. You see, sir, dark I could make anything more, whether really man I caught sight I cannot tell. To mind, schooner struck, she bounded ship, sent bottom. That she sailing ship steamer I pretty certain, I time see her canvas rising us." Dick's statement, far appearance ship concerned, corroborated rest crew, dark two actually seen her she clear schooner running past astern. Dick's statement slightly raised hopes Adair his friends, Lord Saint Maur might escaped, why, he got safely board ship, she heave allow yacht speak her surprising. The supposition she foreigner, he could make understood, officer watch, supposing schooner sunk, afraid heave lest he might made answerable catastrophe. Such utter disregard human life exhibited one occasion, might another instance. However, conjectures useless. If Saint Maur saved would hear again. He would either get board homeward-bound vessel, land first port ship touched. The sad subject discussed again. "I cannot believe Lord Saint Maur dead," said Miss Julia Rogers, Jack's eldest daughter--who looked picture woe since accident, although she said nothing--when she heard Dick's statement. "He telling numerous dangers he Tom in, got all, I do not see he escaped one. Dick Stokes thinks he saw human clinging bowsprit rigging, must Lord Saint Maur, he sailor could easily climbed got board. I picturing his so, astonished sailors must saw him, though very, cruel heave wait us receive back again." Stella smiled sadly young Julia's remark. Murray sanguine his friends. He suspected Dick nodding helm, he his eyes open, he would events given alarm stranger struck yacht. The latter, said, sailing course diagonal ship, she would severely damaged. The bad weather over, _Stella_ sailed Isle Wight. Adair written Counsellor McMahon account accident. He posted letter Dick come his senses, he expressed hopes his nephew escaped. As winds light, _Stella_ three days getting Channel, till late night she brought Ryde. The party, therefore, go shore following morning. His aunt young cousins deeply grieved hearing Desmond's possible fate. "It sad blow Tom Archie hear it," observed Jack Adair. "They great affection three other." Murray remained Ryde days longer, taking trips various directions, captain his family, bidding adieu old friends, sailed, intending go homewards along east coast round north Scotland. Young Alick, yet appointed ship, accompanied his father mother. Next morning, Jack Adair seated breakfast, Adair remarked, he overlooking new navy list, sent library-- "I idea Murray near his flag. I see Sir Benjamin Blowhard, old Grummet, poor Marlin, Kelson, Lord Figgins, used call him, Dick Dotheboys, Oakum, gone way flesh. I saw yesterday's paper Bulkhead died West Indies, two captains senior Murray ill." "I shall rejoice Murray's promotion," said Jack; "there man better suited command fleet." "I cannot say I wish responsibility," observed Adair, "nor I special hurry become admiral, though Lucy may think fine thing, especially I made KCB, which, however, slightest probability. I am much likely kicked sea sent East Indies West Coast Africa sun myself." While conversation going forward, two long official-looking letters received. Julia Lucy looked suspiciously. "Those affectionate gentlemen, Lords Admiralty, request I favour taking command _Bellona_, Murray's old ship," said Jack; "but whether serve home station go Antipodes explain." He handed letter his wife, put her hand her heart, she felt sudden pain there. "Oh, Jack, I think would send again!" she said, deep sigh. "And despatch about?" asked Lucy, trembling voice. "Of tenor Jack's. Those dear old fellows offer command _Empress_, leave much dark Jack I go." Lucy always behaved better her sister-in-law occasions, although she certainly love her husband bit less. "I hope sent foreign station children I live, let us go too," said Lucy; "either North America, Mediterranean, Australia, Cape. I am sure one these." Julia equally pressing allowed go part world _Bellona_ might sent, Jack would wisely make promises. "Well, must go to-morrow next day commission old tubs, I suppose," said Adair, laughing, appointment anything satisfactory, although reality he felt proud sent sea. This event almost banished poor Desmond short time his mind, he received letter Counsellor McMahon:--"I cannot believe young friend gone, efforts made obtain his rights him. I would rather suppose he even swimming somewhere chops Channel, carried ship abominably attempted run down. I always heard midshipmen many lives cat, though he become lieutenant, he abandoned privilege he enjoyed his youth. I do not believe he lost, I intend let either claimants get hold property, assume his title, I stronger evidence his death letter supplies. I remember short time ago, one Lords Admiralty, high official Marine Department, carried stranger running vessel he board, several days he discovered, clung called dolphin striker--although part ship's rigging instrument belongs I know, conclude must end bowsprit--and his lordship hooked breeks, disagreeable position he rescued sympathising crew vessel run his." The lawyer's confidence, although, perhaps, arising insufficient grounds, greatly restored Adair's spirits, he Jack next day went Portsmouth assume command respective ships. Jack applied his brother, Lords Admiralty graciously granted his request. He glad obtain Archie Gordon his first lieutenant. He wrote Murray, saying delighted he young Alick. His letter found _Stella_ lying Leith Roads, she put Firth Forth remain days. In less twenty-four hours young Alick appeared letter his father, requesting Jack obtain necessary articles his outfit. Orders received get ships ready sea possible expedition, two captains found proceed round Cape Good Hope Aden, place orders transmitted them. CHAPTER FIFTEEN. THE BELLONA AND EMPRESS SAIL FOR ADEN--PART COMPANY--BELLONA FALLS IN WITH A MERCHANTMAN IN DISTRESS--A GLEAM OF HOPE--TOUCHES AT THE CAPE AND ADEN, AND PROCEEDS UP THE RED SEA--THE BELLONA REACHES ANNESLEY BAY-- JACK AND TOM LAND AT ZULLA--VISIT THE BRITISH CAMP--EXTENSIVE OPERATIONS GOING FORWARD--MARCH COMMENCED--INTERVIEW BETWEEN SIR ROBERT NAPIER AND THE PRINCE OF TIGRE--THE BRITISH ARMY ADVANCES TO ATTACK MAGDALA-- ENCOUNTERS THEODORE'S FORCES--DEFEAT OF THE ABYSSINIANS--THEODORE SENDS LIEUTENANT PRIDEAUX TO SIR ROBERT--ANXIOUS NEGOTIATIONS--THE CAPTIVES RELEASED--MOST OF THEODORE'S TROOPS LAY DOWN THEIR ARMS--THE KING HOLDS OUT--MAGDALA STORMED--THEODORE SHOOTS HIMSELF--THE FORTRESS DESTROYED-- RETURN MARCH--THE BELLONA SAILS FOR ADEN. The _Bellona_ _Empress_ time sea voyage round Cape Good Hope. Adair had, last moment leaving England, expected hear his nephew, Lord Saint Maur, although he instituted every possible inquiry, news come him. He hoped, Gerald carried ship ran yacht, he would got board homeward-bound vessel landed port whence he could send word his safety, he would certainly done, knowing deep anxiety must felt him, his uncle, his many friends. Though sailing company, Jack Adair seldom able communicate except signal. They had, crossing line, met heavy gale, lost sight other, though fully expected meet long, course ships sailed steamed pretty equal rate. On board _Bellona_, ship must accompany, look-out kept _Empress_, Jack doubt she ahead. But day day sun rose set she appear. The _Bellona_ reached almost latitude Saint Helena, came dead calm, appeared every prospect continuance, Jack unwillingly-- he charged husband his coal--got steam, ship clove her rapid way calm water. Just morning dawned, look-out mast-head announced vessel sight starboard bow. Archie Gordon, who, first lieutenant, paddling his trousers tucked his feet bare, superintending process holystoning washing decks, inquired appearance stranger, hoping she might prove _Empress_. "She looks she met bad weather, sir; her foremast two topmasts gone. She hoisted signal distress half mast high." Tom moment came deck, hearing went aloft his spy-glass look stranger. Being satisfied she really distress, coming down, he sent young Alick inform captain, asked leave steer her. Jack, quickly coming deck, ordered ship headed towards stranger. As _Bellona_ approached, her battered condition became clearly visible; her boats gone, her bulwarks stove in, she lay mere wreck water; people seen her deck, even telescopes directed them, countenances appeared worn haggard stood leaning bulwarks gazing approaching man-of-war. The _Bellona's_ way stopped, boat lowered, Tom soon alongside wreck. "What ship that?" he asked, he pulled up. "The _Argo_, Captain Robson, Hong-kong. In Heaven's Dame, I trust render us assistance," said man, hollow voice. "We short provisions, consumed last drop water yesterday. We dying thirst, scarcely strong enough keep pumps going." "We give help can," said Tom, climbing deck, spectacle met his view convinced truth master's statement. Five hands, whose countenances showed sufferings endured, working away pumps strength possessed, clear stream issued side showing large amount water vessel must making; several others lay deck, exhausted previous exertions. A remained foot, looked ready sink. Tom, seeing this, without inquiries sent young Alick back boat report state ship, requesting carpenter his crew hands might return, assist repairing far possible damages, also supply water provisions might quickly sent. "Water! oh, water! Let us water first!" cried master. The men bent oars, quickly reached _Bellona_. Two boats immediately lowered, Alick's, first ready, cask water put, he several additional hands returned merchantman. The fresh hands jumped board hoisted cask water, sight thirsty crew rushed aft. Tom, stood contents drawn up, hand cup master. He took hurried below. "It is his wife," observed one men; "she is bad." Two boys, whose looks betrayed sufferings, came forward, heaving deep sighs poured refreshing liquid throats. The men followed turn. By time master returned eagerly drank draught water. "Thank Heaven!" he ejaculated. "It restored new strength me, must let pumps idle, water gain upon us rapidly doing." "Let men rest," said Tom, leading way pumps, he his people manned. Meantime Alick took his place cask served water master his men, appeared still far satisfied. Jack, hearing condition merchantman's crew, sent doctor, stepped board. "Stop, lads!" he cried, seeing quantity water men drinking. "You may much simple thing pure water." "Will come see poor wife, sir?" said master, anxious tone. The doctor descended him. Meantime provisions handed up; cans hot cocoa biscuit. The crew stood round like school children, waiting supplied food, difficulty restraining eagerness cups cocoa handed them. The food magical effect, even stretched deck managed move about. Some spars towed _Bellona_, Tom set fitting jury-mast, carpenter his crew went try find leak, see could done stop it. The energetic pumping man-of-war's men soon reduced water hold. After long search carpenter sent say he discovered worst leak already work stopping it. Expressions thankfulness escaped crew heard this, turned vigour hitherto shown, assist repairs going forward. "Your wife well," said doctor, he accompanied master deck. "Proper food she wants, Captain Rogers his utmost supply you." "I shall grateful," said master. "My poor wife would take her share she found men suffering, touch mine, and, delicate, she almost succumbing." The doctor examined suffering crew, returned board report condition, obtain medicines he considered necessary. Jack liberally supplied ship provisions required take home. As he anxious lose little time possible, he also sent Mr Large, boatswain, men board, who, working assiduously, soon got fore jury-mast, repaired bowsprit, set topmasts, rigging, bent fresh sails, carried away. The carpenter, stopped leak, set work patch bulwarks, task diminished crew _Argo_ unable accomplish. Captain Robson gave sad account sufferings. Two men died fever, three washed overboard previous gale, well-nigh sent her bottom. "By-the-by, sir," he said Tom, "we spoke ship commencing, much sea allow us board her. She Dutch colours, bound Batavia. She began signalise us, I could make seemed `British officer, take board, say'; I could distinguish flags, gale came us, much look his signals, probably concern us." "Could make anybody stranger's deck?" asked Tom, eagerly. "No, sir, evening coming on, far that. She big ship, high water one outward bound. However, I note her, she soon sight. That night lost man overboard, weeks later, becalmed ten days more, fell gale reduced us wrecked state found us." "I wish could made signal," said Tom. "Are certain first part `British officer'?" "No doubt that," answered Captain Robson, "and I certain words." "That is strange," thought Tom. "I wonder whether Desmond could board. If so, may hear Batavia, one Spice Islands, stranger bound." Tom, he surveyed still haggard-looking crew commander, felt unfit continue voyage England, proposed he request captain _Bellona_ strengthen her crew, assist navigating her Saint Helena, back Cape. "No, thank you, sir," replied stout-hearted master, "you set rights, given food water, I touch Saint Helena Ascension more, necessary, hope, God's providence, find way safe Mersey. I worse plight this, provided leak does not break again, men fall sick, do not run short provisions water, shall get home time. You come below, sir, leave, let wife thank you. She grateful done us. It return make, present circumstances." Tom accepted invitation, found master's wife seated sofa, ladylike person she seemed be, though she looked dreadfully ill. "I shall better soon, I trust, I wholesome food; God's hands. He knows best good us, must repine. You men, sir, saved lives, could held many hours longer; accept gratitude. Our prayers offered safety wherever go." Tom could remain couple minutes. His men performed tasks, returned ship, his boat one alongside. He jumped her, feeling doubtful whether _Argo_ would ever reach home safety. "Go ahead!" cried captain, Tom's boat hoisted up, _Bellona_ soon left unfortunate _Argo_ astern. In hours, however, met strong breeze, hoped would fill her sails waft her her way. In consequence expenditure much coal, _Bellona_ touch Cape. Jack Tom made every possible inquiry Lord Saint Maur, could gain tidings Dutch ship. "He must, then, gone Batavia. I hopes he might put here," observed Tom. Jack surprised _Empress_ got in, he thought she could done him, consequence his delay assisting _Argo_. Some time occupied taking coal fresh water provisions, make stores supplied merchant vessel. He waited last moment he felt justified doing, still _Empress_ appear, he continue his course Mozambique Channel, he Green well acquainted, onwards Aden. Here he found numerous ships war, several transports store ships. The troops proceed Red Sea Massowah, port belonging Egyptians, Foreign Office obtained permission disembarkation forces destined march rescue British prisoners held captive Theodore, tyrant King Abyssinia. Colliers also arriving coal supply motive power, transit troops also purpose condensing sea fresh water use men animals. The _Bellona_, company numerous ships, proceeded Red Sea. On arrival neighbourhood destined port, found convenient landing-place selected Zulla, shore Annesley Bay. The _Bellona_ steamed slowly amid vast number vessels already arrived, length came anchor. About fourteen miles rose lofty mountains Abyssinia, destined task British soldiers scale. Between mountains sea extended wide plain, could seen large collection white canvas tents, glittering tropical sun. Among red dots represented British soldiers moving about; banner England floated tall flag-staff midst. A long wharf constructed, extending sea, sides lighters, discharging munitions war stores descriptions, countless boats pulled backwards forwards vessels pier. On shore, thousands labourers every hue employed like ants, carrying stores landed commissariat depots. Steam-engines work, rendering help sorts; condensing salt water, and, turned fresh fit drinking, forcing pipes shore. Nearly every hour fresh vessels arriving, Suez Aden, former bringing mules horses vast numbers, employed transport service, latter camels even elephants, attended swarthy drivers, sent India. Jack, accompanied his brother, hastened shore report his arrival request know commander-in-chief service he could render. He little pleased find naval brigade formed, prospect seeing fighting wild mountainous region rose them, people general seemed know little. [See note 1.] Of course expected warfare subject conversation ward room, various opinions hazarded result. "We shall know course days, march commenced," observed first lieutenant. "The question whether Theodore murder his prisoners fight last, whether, he sees approach formidable force ours, he deliver apologise his conduct." "At events best help soldiers," said Tom, sentiment general throughout squadron, never soldiers sailors work cordially together. The next morning Tom his men, Billy Blueblazes Dicky Duff, senior mate, Alick Murray midshipman, went shore join Naval Brigade, which, infinite satisfaction, appointed. It command Captain Fellows. They two days encamped order commence march issued. The army, detachments, moved forward front, commander-in-chief started 25th January. The first post Senaffe, high among mountains, 7000 feet level sea. It situated two miles front issue Komayli defile, elevated rocky ground. To east west rose lofty cliffs, front extended wide plain. The scenery magnificent. Here rose masses jagged rock, topped acacia juniper trees, deep valleys intervened rushing streams, heights extended far eye could range vast extent country. Tom fancied army push without stopping, he found post fortified garrisoned, evident expedition showed strength, proportion obtained confidence savage rulers country. In spite, however, toil army undergo, men high spirits, seamen especially laughing joking marched along. They could carry small amount provisions; every article baggage could dispensed left behind. In regard provisions, hoped that, arriving next post, would amply provided. Billy groaned he went puffing blowing hills. "I believe, Mr Rogers, worse making way Papua." "I cannot agree there," answered Tom, laughing. "We found pretty hard work, sure, crossing mountains, several days go short allowance food water, I expect things mend advance, shall get fertile region." Tom right. At length army emerged broader still barren portion pass, road winding steeply several miles along snowy water-course, whence passed plain, which, number guinea fowls found there, obtained name "Guinea Fowl Plain." Here seen tulip trees enormous size, graceful acacias, cactus, stiff, prickly leaves, grew profusion among rocks. Antelopes frequently bounded across road, said great distance elephants wild boars found. Birds sizes, gorgeous plumage, flashed sunlight. Monkeys baboons appeared scrambling among rocks, leaping tree tree, jabbering strangers visiting territory. "Those beasts remind Papua, though different appearance," observed Billy. "We astonish friends shoot cook big monkey dinner. I should not mind eating one, I know." The monkeys, however, generally wary come within gunshot; Billy opportunity astonishing his friends, he certainly would done. The country passed continued rugged barren extreme. The villages consisted groups mud hovels, generally pitched high ground, originally defence. The inhabitants tall, fine figures, men dressed single robe cotton, seldom washed, black hair plaited covered rancid butter. Their arms generally consisted crooked sword spear, well club. Such weapons used ages ancestors; many matchlocks, others even double-barrelled guns. The discipline army strict, plundering took place; inhabitants everywhere treated kindness. Negotiations opened Prince Tigre, professed friendship British. Nothing created much astonishment appearance elephants, followed crowds wondering natives, impression elephant could tamed. The arrival battery Armstrong guns created equal surprise. Notwithstanding difficulties road, gunners succeeded carrying guns Adigerat. Step step army advanced, Anotolo reached, 2nd March. Anotolo may said half-way Zulla Magdala. Letters received prisoners, stating Theodore still engaged efforts get his ordnance heavy baggage Magdala; but, impeded his mortar, likely he could reach stronghold first week March. News brought Kassai, Prince Tigre, advancing, seek interview British general, Sir Robert accordingly marched forward, taking advantage cool hours morning meet banks Diab. The force, accompanied several guns, pitched camp half mile eastern bank river, arranged divide two armies. The scenery around magnificent, ground sloping gradually western bank Diab, Tigrean army posted. The sun shone brilliantly. The heat excessive. About eleven of the clock vanguard Kassai's army seen approaching, body men hurriedly coming forward, pitched red tent slope opposite strangers' camp. Just midday whole Tigrean army, drums beating standards flying, consisting 4000 men, advanced slope towards river, two yellow red flags fluttering high heads showing position chief his principal officers. Sir Robert directed tent raised close bank river, meeting take place. As soon Abyssinians seen advancing, English forces got arms. The commander-in-chief, mounted elephant, followed his staff, rode forward. The appearance elephant undoubtedly greatly impressed Abyssinians, supposed African elephants untameable. On getting near stream Sir Robert descended his elephant, mounted horse, Abyssinian line opened; Kassai, surrounded his chiefs mounted white mule, crimson umbrella borne his head, came forward, fording river approached Sir Robert. The Abyssinian chief wore white robe embroidered crimson round his body, flowered silk shirt; his black hair, carefully plaited, drawn back his forehead, tied behind his neck ribbon. He still prime manhood. His complexion dark olive hue, his countenance intellectual; he looked careworn anxious. After usual civilities gone through, Sir Robert conducted his guest tent, guard honour drawn fired salute, evidently causing small alarm chiefs mind his followers, probably expected strangers would set upon shoot down. On dismounting Sir Robert led chief tent, respective officers arranged either side, Abyssinians squatting ground. The conversation time commonplace. Then presents brought offered, among fine Arab horse, gift Sir Robert himself. Port wine served out, greatly satisfaction chiefs, all, exception two principal officers parties, retired, serious matters entered Sir Robert Kassai, assured he showed friendly disposition would send grain army, he would handsomely rewarded. After prince rested, review forces took place. The regiments, whose uniforms picturesque, among seen light blue silver Bombay cavalry, scarlet King's Own, dark blue red facings artillery, scarlet coats white turbans Tenth Native Infantry, went various manoeuvres. Now skirmished, formed square receiving cavalry, cavalry charged furiously supposed foe. The prince appeared take especial interest rifled guns, complimented British possessing, he called it, "so inestimable blessing." Sir Robert returned visit later day, his staff crossed stream Abyssinian camp. The uniform soldiers Tigre picturesque, quite according European notions. Their heads bare, except covering plaited hair afforded. They wore long white robes, embroidered scarlet, greater number possessed firearms, either matchlocks double-barrelled percussion guns, even double-barrelled rifles, many pistols, wore long, crooked swords right side. A comparative armed sword, spear, shield. The cavalry, number 400 men, mounted shaggy ponies mules. The discipline men was, however, good, went number movements creditable manner. The general his staff descended close Kassai's tent; inside couch, covered silk, prince placed Sir Robert his side. Several richly variously dressed officers also present, evening sun, shining red tent group, produced picturesque scenic effect. Girls soon afterwards came in, bearing baskets bread curry. They followed others carrying huge jugs, filled tedj, beverage manufactured fermented honey. Each guest expected drink several flasks, tasted somewhat like bad small beer, great satisfaction performing necessary ceremony. Shortly afterwards band six musicians, playing long pipes, performed wild piece music; minstrel sang war song, Abyssinians joined. The entertainment considered end, chief insisted presenting Sir Robert gifts he prepared. The first consisted silver gilt armlet, sign great warrior, clasped round general's arm. Then lion's skin mane, mark fierce fighter battle, thrown his shoulder, sword next girt his side, spear shield, intended his use, handed one _aides-de-camp_, acted nonce his armour bearer. In guise general ride back his camp mule, fortunately time shades evening closed in, he prevented exhibiting antique guise his troops. Notwithstanding professions friendship promises assistance he received, Sir Robert wisely put perfect faith prince, determined fortify his posts guard his advance, he passing country enemy. At Anotolo army re-distributed divisions, separate duty assigned. Tom his men marched second brigade first division. Communication kept whole way Zulla, telegraph wire laid down. On 20th March Sir Robert led forward his forces Tat. From station he began rapid advance Magdala. Hitherto every movement preparation undertaking. By 31st March army great distance line Theodore's advance posts, scouts frequently seen horseback, nimble captured. Precautions taken night attack, supposed Theodore would make. Several enemy's deserted camps passed. The inhabitants hitherto universally friendly, Gallas, gained consequence barbarous treatment received Theodore, undertook guard passes tyrant could make his way eastward. Young Alick Murray bravely endured fatigues march; he generally kept side Tom, who, indeed, unwilling his sight. As officers Naval Brigade sat round camp fire night, many yarn spun many merry song sung, day, marched on, jokes constantly cracked seamen, whose spirits never flagged. They always meeting objects sort interest them, scenery route lay often magnificent extreme. At length Delanta Heights reached river Bashilo flowing beneath course westward, hereafter swell waters mighty Nile, one numberless tributaries. On either side valley river flowed rose series rugged heights forming crescent, eastern horn stood fortress Magdala, Theodore's supposed impregnable stronghold, west rugged hill Fahla, mid-way lofty plateau Selassie. Magdala Selassie seen connected ridge, known Saddle Islamgi, ridge joining Selassie Fahla called Saddle Fahla. The plateau Magdala stood rose height upwards 9000 feet sea, 3000 ravines immediately surrounding it. The sides steep scarped nature seemed would impossible scale them, closer inspection showed two causeways led plateau, one Islamgi one Sangalat. Theodore's army, size strength unknown, seen encamped spit Islamgi. A deep ravine led wide valley beneath heights occupied Abyssinians. Over-looking plain Arogi spur, bearing different parts names Gumbaji Afficho, Sir Robert resolved occupy, he could operate either side Fahla, evidently key Theodore's position. The army encamped Bashilo, troops high spirits thoughts length meet enemy marched many miles encounter. Sir Robert his staff crossed river reconnoitred ground, early dawn 10th April advance ordered. As water procured river fortress, except enemy's fire, band carriers organised transporting supply troops, another band marched rear stretchers removal wounded. While greater part troops toiling slowly steep slopes Gumbaji spur, destined occupy, Naval Brigade party artillery, baggage first brigade, making way pass Wurki Waha valley, intention general secure body infantry, form road thence Gumbaji spur. The latter task, mistake, performed, issue pass secured. The day threatening, already showers rain begun fall, roars thunder flashes lightning burst clouds. The mules artillery Rocket Brigade emerged valley, when, echoing roar thunder, report gun heard, fired heights Theodore's army posted, whence, moment, body warriors seen descending, evidently intention attacking artillery. The small body British immediately prepared expected encounter. Most enemy foot, though some, evidently chiefs, gorgeous scarlet costumes, mounted. The Naval Brigade, hastening Afficho plateau, got rocket tubes position receive advancing mass foe. Their position critical extreme. Should Abyssinians push forward might overwhelmed numbers. Without thinking that, however, began blazing away rockets, every missile telling fearfully among crowded ranks Theodore's troops, who, brave were, appeared thrown confusion. Tom looked round see support coming. At first thought flashed upon he his companions must annihilated overwhelming hordes barbarians rapidly approaching. Young Alick thinking much thing, sign fear exhibited his countenance. "I suppose, Mr Rogers, shall pretty hard fight it?" he remarked; "but will not let take rocket tubes events." "No fear that," answered Tom. "See, troops advancing." While he speaking, one party Abyssinians seen coming towards artillery baggage guard, were, however, prepared receive them, another larger party, taking different course, hurried battle, rugged ground red coats British seen making way skirmishers front, rapid crack rifles heard got within range enemy. The troops engaged consisted King's Own Regiment, Belochees, detachment Royal Engineers Bombay Sappers, men cheering lustily saw enemy them. At time two companies 4th Regiment, body pioneers, attacked enemy flank, pouring rapid discharges Snider rifles, rockets whizzing ranks, artillery produced equal havoc. All time enemy's guns playing British columns, but, owing elevated position, fire plunging, shot, use heavy charges powder, ranged far harm. The seamen continued fire rockets among mass Abyssinians infantry, advancing, drove back enemy, rockets directed upon summit Fahla, Theodore his staff still posted. So good practice, caused confusion dismay, one, afterwards ascertained, nearly killed king he superintending fire his guns. Though defeated quarters again, Abyssinians advanced. Masses slain wounded covered plain. For three hours contest continued, when, spite heroic courage, dark-skinned warriors compelled retire, first slowly steadily heights, panic length appeared seize cast eye ground fought, covered heaps men, larger number took flight. The pursuit continued way, Sir Robert wisely prevented his troops advancing far, lest British retire, Abyssinians might regain courage. Wet weary exertions gone through, troops bivouacked night mouth ravine. "I cannot say I admire campaigning," observed Billy Blueblazes, sitting round camp fire wet ground, lofty hills rising them, cries wounded Abyssinians could still heard various parts plain fallen. The British camp kept constantly alert lights seen passing plain; length discovered borne Abyssinians searching wounded dead countrymen. The British wounded amounted twenty men. They soon brought in. Most suffering spear wounds, received desperate attempt Abyssinians capture baggage. Such wounded Abyssinians could found also brought British camp attended surgeons. Next morning Tom, several officers, went battle-field, exhibited scene horror every direction. At entrance ravine, men horses heaped together, shot pierced sword bayonet, ten twelve together. Further could seen tracks blood, wounded attempted crawl back friends gain shelter rock bush. Almost middle field lay dead body Theodore's chief general, arrayed splendid scarlet dress, surrounded less seven chiefs fallen him. Further right, firing long ranges, fewer dead, numbers stretched wounded ground. The points towards rockets chiefly directed could discovered charred masses, showing awful death missiles carried wherever sped devastating course. The British army, taken position, advancing attack enemy, when, far distance, white flag made out, borne aloft midst small party horsemen, came winding mountain path meet them. As approached nearer, uniform British officer seen among them. Amid joyful cheers Lieutenant Prideaux missionary, Mr Flad, rode outposts towards Sir Robert Napier's tent. They came verbal message king. He acknowledged heretofore he considered important personage world, discovered others powerful, he consequently desired reconciled his sister sovereign, Queen England. Sir Robert replied he must come put power her general, terms could accepted. The British lieutenant missionary, courage heroes, returned answer writing, knowing perfectly well tyrant his rage might put death. Some time elapsed, returned written answer Theodore, he declared his intention conquer whole world, that, among things, he hoped lead army Jerusalem expel Turks it; consequently he inclined yield British arms. To absurd missive Sir Robert sent back answer he returned morning Lieutenant Prideaux Mr Flad, owned apprehensions put death naturally increased. Intense joy many others accompanied part journey see large band persons approaching camp, turned envoy Mr Rassam, Consul Cameron, Doctor Blanc, several others. "The king," said, "convinced he defeated, put pistol his head attempted destroy himself. On wrested him, he ordered release captives, immediately took advantage his permission get his power." During day herd cattle arrived outpost, sent savage king peace offering, animals returned Sir Robert, saw importance exhibiting signs wavering. Not necessary vindicate honour England, but, justice tribes assisted British march, absolutely necessary remove Theodore country, for, he escaped, he would failed revenged sided his foes. Some his troops gathered round him, and, his spirits reviving, he led Magdala. The larger portion, however, deserted him, thousands flying fortress. Sir Robert meantime posted his forces that, aid Gallas, outlet escape left Theodore. The second brigade occupied heights Selassie, king's troops entered Magdala ordered lay arms. This immediately did, number 10,000 men, besides 15,000 20,000 women children, fled husbands fathers fortress. They hurried fast narrow path would allow plain below, remained watch issue contest. A curious scene enacted Islamgi Saddle, occupied detachment cavalry well company infantry. Between Magdala, Theodore posted his six guns. A party fortress issued dragged two these, four could removed, completely fire British rifles. Theodore appeared mounted handsome charger, when, riding towards his foes, he began careering about, boasting his mighty deeds, occasionally firing his rifle, shouting loud voice British officers would come forth meet him. He took good care, however, his retreat fortress cut off, could done prevent his followers making escape side Saddle. Tom, party his men, joined infantry thus engaged. As moving along top cliff, noses assailed fearful odour. Looking down, horror see, foot precipice right, mass human bodies dreadful state corruption, chained together, others manacled, many among old men, women, children. They unfortunate prisoners carried party fortress time before, put death drunken fit Theodore day he heard approach British. It was, truth, fearful sight, increased desire soldiers sailors inflict condign punishment author atrocity. The end approaching. Sir Robert occupied his troops nearest level spot principal gate Magdala, and, planting his artillery rocket battery commanding positions, he prepared assault. Beyond point, known Saddle Islamgi, rock fortress stood rose 300 feet height, precipitous sides, narrow, steep, winding path leading it, two lines defence, narrow gateway. It thus difficult get sight defenders, yet occasionally armed men seen moving about, stubborn resistance expected. With humanity worthy imitation, Sir Robert placed his guns act upon gate, without running risk hurting women children still within fortress. The two brigades advanced, storming party leading, and, covered fire, steep path climbed scaling-ladders fixed, crowbars burst open gates. They met hot fire garrison, man could seen. Before stormers wall, surrounded strong thick barricade stout stakes, narrow stone gateway. On reaching gateway engineers, finding powder-bags forthcoming, immediately set work crowbars burst in, when, disappointment discover pile large stones, twelve feet height, still greater breadth, directly front them. All time exposed fire garrison. In vain endeavoured surmount formidable barricade, length party 33rd Regiment, turning right, discovered lower part wall, scaling-ladder placed. Immediately mounting, reached top wall, and, leaping down, forming so, attacked garrison, who, seeing fortress entered, took flight towards second defence. The whole regiment quickly in, and, pressing fugitives, rushed second gateway, when, summit fortress gained, British flag quickly flying it. On Abyssinians, throwing arms, asked quarter, granted. But become unhappy king, chief misery suffering endured his unhappy subjects many years? Stretched ground leading second gateway palace his body found, pistol-bullet his head, weapon he shot still his side. Near outward gateway lay several his devoted chiefs, rest his officers, throwing arms, endeavoured escape. They all, however, long, driven back Gallas, watching side, compelled return fortress, delivered up. Taking possession Magdala, Sir Robert, made hasty survey it, collected Abyssinians centre space, placed strong guard them. An anxious night commenced, moment numberless thatched buildings covered heights might set fire heavy loss life ensued. The two gates carefully watched, and, owing admirable arrangements, disturbance occurred. The inhabitants desired take departure, body Theodore delivered his unhappy queen, interred two days afterwards church Magdala. The queen her son came British camp, received honourable treatment, inhabitants escorted far necessary towards district friends. The fortress afterwards destroyed, buildings within set fire, guns captured also burst fragments. As British army retired could see many league dense clouds smoke rose sky hung like funeral pall stronghold tyrant king. "I am thankful we have done it, done well," exclaimed Tom, he, his blue jackets, commenced march towards Annesley Bay. "So I," answered Billy Blueblazes. "For part, I do not like campaigning business. It may pleasant tolerable good road plenty eat, I do not like climb hills exist short commons." The return march without dangers, rebel tribes watch attack weak convoy, tempted plunder hoped obtain, aware British likely follow far mountain fastnesses; indeed, several persons incautiously wandered line march cut murdered. The events return march need described. It managed skill advance, although troops suffered somewhat storms rain exposed. With small satisfaction men Naval Brigade returned respective ships, whose crews, however, remain assist embarkation troops stores. "Why, Mr Blewitt, appear lost two stone weight!" observed first lieutenant Billy made his appearance board. "Yes, sir," answered Billy, rueful countenance. "I believe I have lost three stone; I intend best make I have got back ship." Billy fail keep his intentions, rest mess declared he ought pay double subscription, he certainly consumed two others among them. "So would fellows gone I done," answered Billy, he gave, first time, account hardships he endured, weight he carried his shoulders, his hard fare, steep hills he climbed, abrupt descents he make his way. The _Bellona_ remained ships war troops gone last stores embarked, Annesley Bay left itself, original solitude. With cheerful song crew tramped round round capstan, steam got up, _Bellona_, proceeding bay, steered Aden, Captain Rogers hoped obtain intelligence _Empress_. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Note 1.

THE BELLONA PROCEEDS DOWN THE AFRICAN COAST--OVERHAULS A SUSPICIOUS DHOW--TOM FINDS HIS OLD ACQUAINTANCE PANGO ON BOARD, AND THE DHOW IS CONDEMNED--AFTER TOUCHING AT ZANZIBAR, THE BELLONA PROCEEDS TO SIMON'S BAY--TAKES TROOPS ON BOARD FOR CAFFRARIA--MAJOR BUBSBY AND HIS FAMILY--A STORM IN THE CABIN--BILLY IN LOVE--A HEAVY SURF ON THE COAST--MACHINERY GIVES WAY--SHIP ON A LEE SHORE--ATTEMPT TO BEAT OFF--BILLY AND ANGELICA FALL OUT--THE BELLONA ANCHORS--IN GREAT DANGER--HAS TO STAND OFF SHORE-- A MAN ON A RAFT PICKED UP--INTERESTING INFORMATION--A FIRE BREAKS OUT ON BOARD--THE MAJOR'S FAMILY LOWERED INTO A BOAT--HE IS DETAINED BY ANGELICA--THE BOAT DROPPED ASTERN--THE FIRE IS EXTINGUISHED--THE MAJOR COLDLY RECEIVED BY HIS OFFICERS--THE TROOPS LANDED--THE MAJOR BEGS TO RETURN IN THE BELLONA--JACK REFUSES, AND SENDS HIM ON SHORE--THE STRANGER PICKED UP REPORTS HAVING SEEN A SIGNAL ON A LONE ROCK--THE BELLONA REACHES SIMON'S BAY, AND SAILS IN SEARCH OF THE EMPRESS. Jack hopes touching Aden he might hear something _Empress_, word received her. Taking coal sandy unattractive England's possessions, _Bellona_ sailed Cape. She actually sail, wind fair, Jack, common officers, received orders consume little coal possible. A bright look-out kept slavers, several suspicious-looking craft overhauled, black-looking individuals found board appeared either part crew passengers, allowed proceed voyage. Some time Zanzibar reached, dhow seen early one morning becalmed. Some hours previously _Bellona_ got her steam, cleaving her way rapidly smooth water. By altering her course slightly she thus able pass close enough dhow ascertain her character. As sun rose, breeze sprang up, dhow seen hoist her largest sail stand away coast. As looked suspicious, gun fired, signal her heave to. The breeze increasing, she might lead _Bellona_ considerable distance her course. She took notice signal, continued standing before, her crew possibly ignorant rate dark-looking stranger could go. Full speed put on, steamer gained chase, Captain Rogers continued throwing shot either side her, effect, however, first. As, however, _Bellona_ must ere long come dhow, he refrained firing shot her, he felt much inclined do. At length, Arabs saw could possibly reach shore overtaken, lowered huge sail, _Bellona_ quickly them. A boat lowered, Tom Alick soon pulled alongside dhow. As Tom interpreter, knew much Arabic he ancient Chaldean, he could judge character craft appearance things. Her crew picturesque gentlemen, but, judging looks, cut-throats every one them, without ceremony would stuck long daggers English officers dared. But sight yardarm man-of-war, speak her guns, wonderful effect keeping gentry order. Along decks arranged party ladies gentlemen, jet black, dressed variety fanciful costumes. Some pink checked shirts, others blankets shoulders, others loose trousers vests, easy see destitute garments. Nearly score naked fellows, clothes round waists, standing round halyards, holding part crew. Tom inquired savage-looking fellow came forward character captain, came from. "Zanzibar," answer. "And bound for?" The captain pointed north-east, pronounced name chart. "Of many men ship's company consist?" asked Tom, making signs hauling away his hands, pretending rowing, holding his fingers pretending count. The skipper pointed black fellows forward Arabs, were, indeed, alone quite sufficient navigating craft. "Who ebony-coloured ladies gentlemen sit demurely deck?" asked Tom, pointing them. The Arab replied signs paid money his hands passage, putting his head down, sleep, work do. "So passengers," observed Tom. "I understand that, fine fellow, look below." In cabin seated nearly dozen young women girls, dressed somewhat elegant costumes deck. "Who these?" asked Tom. The captain signified his wives. "What! them, old wretch?" cried Tom. The captain smiled return, pressed his hand his heart, either signify he speaking truth reigned supreme. "We peep hold." Tom, telling Alick look deck, descended two hands below. As little light reached region, appeared first entirely empty. The odour pleasant. Tom point returning deck he heard groan, hurrying fore part, dim light came down, he distinguished human form lying deck. Blood streaming poor fellow's head. Tom his men lifted up, discovering one else, carried main hatchway. He quickly revived fresher air, gazed astonishment lieutenant his men. "Who you, poor fellow?" asked Tom, expecting answer. "Me Pango; served board English man-war." "Pango!" exclaimed Tom, remembering black rescued Zanzibar _Opal_, who, serving board her time, lost sight of. "I recollect you, wish shall come board again, I want first know people are." "All slavy, slavy," answered Pango. "Dey jus' dress up, an' I tell cap'n dat trick do, he cut an' try kill me." "There time lost; take deck, soon show skipper speak truth," said Tom. The Arab captain looked much taken aback, he cast savage glances poor Pango; he saw, however, game up, useless longer attempt deceiving English officer. Tom immediately ordered several his crew get boat, conveyed board _Bellona_, charge Alick. Another boat lowered, Pango taken board, remainder Arab crew, surgeon might look him. Tom returned _Bellona_. Jack decided taking supposed passengers board. As soon Pango sufficiently recovered act interpreter, examined, said forced dress up, threatened would thrown overboard. It ascertained carried away coast many days before, come long journey interior. Pango picked canoe fishing shore, carried away. The evidence clear Jack, without hesitation, destroyed dhow, could towed way Zanzibar, resolving risk consequences. During passage several dhows met with, although blacks board, sufficient evidence prove slaves. It convinced Jack, however, abominable trade still carried on, thousands Africans carried Arabia, Persia, parts Asia, toil hopeless slavery remainder lives, would necessary make yet strenuous efforts effectually put down. He remembered, too, horrors he witnessed heard connection slave trade interior, whole villages districts depopulated, numbers killed perished hunger, besides captured Arabs. Pango assistance enabling condemn two dhows, besides he compelled let escape. The black improved rapidly English, rather recovered he lost. Jack asked he wished put shore. "Me go shore 'gain," answered Pango. "May slave fellow take 'gain. Me go ship go. Me stay board. Pango sailor man." He accordingly entered one crew, greatly his delight. Jack inquired his brother Bango. Pango's countenance became sad. "Do slavy man take him. Me tinke cut troat. Me see five years;" poor Pango burst tears he thought fate overtaken Bango, showing Africans, events, great affection relatives white men theirs. On arriving Zanzibar, Jack handed Arab crew authorities, dealt infraction law; slaves placed board another man-of-war, carried Seychelle Islands, might enjoy liberty climate suited constitutions. Jack disappointed gaining Zanzibar tidings _Empress_. Running Mozambique Channel, he continued his course Cape Town, he arrived without adventure. His first inquiry _Empress_. No tidings, however, received, serious apprehensions felt her safety. "It supposed she must foundered typhoon Indian seas, she ever got there; she cast away gone pieces unknown rock," answer received. "Poor Adair! end?" exclaimed Jack, sorrowfully. "I will not believe it, however. I trust Lucy hear reports." A day his arrival mail England came in, bringing letters Julia Murray, gained his rank admiral. "As many good officers seeking employment, I conclude I shall virtually shelved, although boy's sake I would gladly gone sea again," wrote Murray. "His mother I looking anxiously tidings him. His last letter gave us account commencement Abyssinian expedition, he go country Naval Brigade. It important youngster see service shore well afloat, although naturally feel anxious lest he suffered hardships he must necessity exposed. We are, therefore, eagerly looking forward his next letter. Our girls well, hear good accounts Julia yours; Lucy naturally sad state anxiety. No tidings reached England _Empress_, anything heard Saint Maur. I continuing make possible inquiries, written agents various seaports ascertain masters ships trading foreign endeavour find clue his fate." The remainder letter referred private matters. The _Bellona_ remained time Simon's Bay, board hopes sent home, when, transport ready, Captain Rogers requested proceed wing --- Regiment coast Caffraria, immediately wanted put serious outbreak natives. It far satisfactory pleasant task, _Bellona_ accommodation officers men; Captain Rogers person throw difficulties way service could rendered country. He lately, his constant intercourse military men, got without dispute; he hoped would case present. All hands busily employed taking baggage board embarking men, neither he his officers much time attend guests. The last person arrive board Major Bubsby, commanding troops; Jack little taken aback he found he brought his wife two tall daughters board. The lady almost twice height her better half, daughters promised grow proportions. The major undoubtedly short man, although small one either girth his estimation. He rubicund countenance, huge mustachios, small, ferrety eyes. "I aware ladies, I advised bring them, although, come, I endeavour provide best accommodation I them," said Jack, his usual politeness. "You must understand, Captain Rogers, I never move anywhere without Mrs Bubsby daughters. They accustomed camp life, like it; I wounded fall sick, I hand nurse me. I require care, I young I was, though still strong active;" major twirled his mustachios gave loud "Ahem!" "I afraid ladies put much inconvenience, board shore; for, regiment advance interior, I do not know become them," observed Jack. "And take advice--though, I said, I perfectly ready accommodate them--you leave Cape Town await return." "Never! Captain Rogers, never!" exclaimed Major Bubsby. "If I I shall know about." "But killed, may sharp fighting, become wife daughters?" observed Jack, eyeing stout little major. "Then, Captain Rogers, I must beg kindness far oblige take back Cape Town," answered major, looking evidently he quite like remark. "I service thirty years, intention Caffres savages take life. They contemptible lot. Why, glance eye alone would sufficient put whole host niggers flight!" "As please, Major Bubsby," said Jack. "I shall ready appropriate portion cabin wife daughters, I direct carpenter put screen, may live private wish so." "Ah, do, do," answered major. This conversation took place earshot Mrs Bubsby, aware Jack's kind intentions towards her. Jack, approaching bow, requested her her daughters remain deck cabin fitted accommodation. "We things rapidly board, shall detain long," he added. "I surprised major intimate his intention bring us; like him," answered Mrs Bubsby. "He worthy man, devotedly attached daughters. Allow introduce them. Eugenia, eldest, Angelica, second daughter. They look forward greater pleasure voyage life bush I do, I confess. They good-hearted girls, would ready follow father field, required." "Ah, yes; care go, do," said Eugenia. "We never happy horseback living canvas." "I delight sea, I love seamen," said Angelica, smiling sweetly captain. She aware Jack possessed wife family. He quit ladies attend duty ship. "Blue Peter" flying time, gun fired hurry shore. The anchor weighed, _Bellona_ her living freight steamed majestically harbour. As soon things got somewhat rights, baggage stowed away, soldiers berthed, Jack his lieutenants time look officers. Directly ladies' cabin ready, Jack escorted below. Mrs Bubsby cast somewhat indignant glance canvas screen put up, said nothing. But Eugenia exclaimed-- "How nice! shall hear everything said outside, you will hear us, must take care talk about." "I am sure shall hear nothing pleasant sensible right," said Jack, less veracity his will not speak. Mrs Bubsby gave "hem!" Jack, bowing, left cabin possession his fair guests. The major pacing deck, fussing fuming. Something gone wrong him. Jack kept his way. He already got hold one his junior officers, he explaining happened. At last he came Jack. "I must beg you, Captain Rogers, put back. My dressing-case, valuables large amount, left behind; certainty stolen. I cannot without campaigning; fearful inconvenience board. I give written request, think necessary one." "I cannot return harbour purpose, even written request you," answered Jack, scarcely able restrain his laughter. "Perhaps case question brought board all. If not, anything I possess I shall happy place disposal." "You possess I require, I sure," answered major. "But tell case contains I cannot supply!" said Jack. The major took Jack arm led earshot his officers. "My second set teeth," he whispered. "I confide fact you; I shall never masticate food without them; I shall die indigestion." Jack could help giving way his inclination laugh. "I own, major, I possess second set teeth description, try doctor; he clever man, although things supplied among medical stores, he may possibly some." "I shall grateful he furnish me," answered major, tone before; "but return port, I must request institute search dressing-case. You speak contents?" Jack promised major requested, directed Tom learn case belonging one officers carried forward stowed away mistake. The major allowed his "woman kind," he called them, time shake berths, went below. He long Jack, gone his cabin, heard low whispering within. He caught words-- "It fault!" "It yours!" "I tell not. I looked everything entrusted me. Sniggins kept better eye baggage." "No; he blame. It business look smaller articles; reason I carry daughters about?" "I am sure I do not want go. You girls made me." "I made you? I never made anything life like. My beloved, losing temper!" "I tell I cool cucumber!" answered lady, tone her voice belying assertion. "Do not fall it, papa," said younger voice. "You inclined aggravating." "My dear, I calm mamma," said major. "Then come accuse I did not?" cried lady. "I stand treatment. It fault!" "It is fault, I say! Why case left behind?" "It fault," exclaimed Mrs Bubsby. "I will teach repeat falsehoods!" There slight scream Eugenia, echoed Angelica, sounds greatly resembling produced person his ears boxed, proceeded canvas. Directly afterwards major, flushed countenance bald head, rushed door, followed wig sent missile him. On seeing Captain Rogers reading corner cabin, he tried pick up, vessel giving gentle roll time, sent flying middle cabin he succeeded his object. Pulling his handkerchief vain endeavour conceal his shaven crown, he uttered groan. Jack tried look him, believing he hurt, compelled length inquire matter. "I confessed you, Captain Rogers, I made use false teeth addition natural ones, discovered I wear wig. But not, I trust, make known officers, may lose respect entertain me." A scornful laugh within showed major's last observation overheard, one agree it. Jack, however, kindly rising his seat, picked major's wig, handed him, helped get his legs. "Do wish return cabin?" asked Jack. The major shook his head. "Not present," he whispered; "I will wait storm blown over. She good woman," pointing his thumb might supposed Mrs Bubsby standing; "but she is little hasty, see, times. I would left her behind, I could bring girls without chaperon, besides she would come, whether I liked not. I frank you, Captain Rogers; I frank nature." "Would like walk deck, Major Bubsby?" asked Jack, wishing make remark presence lady, aware every word he uttered would reach her ears. "Yes, indeed, I would," answered major; "a little fresh air would greatly restore me. These fits apt unman time, I quickly recover, soon resume command amazon forces." Jack heard another scornful laugh within, major hurried main cabin. The captain good-naturedly paced deck minutes, listening account his domestic woes, arising Mrs Bubsby's somewhat uncertain temper. "She main, however, charming creature, charming I married her--a perfect angel. Still charming, though less angelic, I will allow, times." Jack could help smiling. The major observed him. "You doubt assertion! Wait married long I have, thirty years more, you will understand what is what. You married, I conclude, Captain Rogers?" "I happiness so, although poor sailors allowed carry wives families us, military men privilege doing." "That disappointment Eugenia Angelica," observed major, apparently speaking himself. "They fully speculated bachelor. You bachelor officers, however, captain?" "Oh, yes," answered Jack laughing; "my three lieutenants unmarried, rest officers, exception doctor paymaster." "That is consolation, events. If there is one thing I heart another, see charming daughters well married." "I wish every success laudable object," said Jack, "but matter I decline interfere respect officers. Indeed young take upon responsibilities married life. In opinion naval officer venture fall love he thirty least, he intends get service, would much better wait years beyond that." "Ah, daughters would consider young," said major. "Angelica engaged herself young gentleman seventeen, would married his father, objected match, sent country, poor girl month least could hold her head. It fresh regiment arrived she way recovered her usual buoyant spirits, less three admirers dangling her. One old she could make her mind accept him. Another head ears debt, asked pay his bills, condition he would take daughter hands, third had, I found out, unacknowledged wife. So see sweet Angelica perfectly free give her heart hand first person asks her." The major, he made revelations, appear aware effect likely produce his auditor, who, may supposed, found difficult offer remark them. "I think I may venture below, time given storm raged certain region calm down," said major, beginning feel little tired long pacing deck. Jack advised means return his cabin. He wanted, indeed, enjoy good hearty fit laughter himself, he felt every instant ready explode. He somewhat astonished Tom, deck, he length gave way his feelings major's head disappeared deck. Tom, hearing account major's expulsion cabin, may supposed, joined his brother Jack his merriment, difficulty hours afterwards he could refrain bursting fits laughter. The _Bellona_ steamed on; full speed, however, engineer found something amiss machinery, begged captain, soon wind shift, proceed sail, he might opportunity repairing defect. The young ladies constantly deck, endeavouring make charming possible. Archie Gordon Tom respectfully polite, took care commit undue attentions. Billy Blueblazes far less cautious. Whenever he could find spare minute, he sure make his way side fair Angelica. At last, one night, Tom watch, he surprised find Billy walk him. "I thought you would turned in," remarked Tom. "It would not use; I could not slept I tried," answered Billy, sigh. "I want, Tom, confide secret you." "What it?" inquired Tom. "You quarrel military officers, I hope?" "Oh, no, no," answered Billy. "I know, Rogers, susceptible tender passion, I want make confidant. I love, irretrievably, hopelessly love, fair object affections returns it, she assures me, ardour. But, know, income small. At present I nothing pay, keep allow pounds spend tarts jellies ice creams, I give events, would terrible sacrifice. And major, her father, evidently hard-hearted, stubborn old fogey, mother's she-dragon. The adorable creature insists I shall marry her first opportunity. She, indeed, proposes chaplain perform ceremony board, I afraid captain would allow that, I fearful state perplexity." "Which it?" asked Tom; "for appeared equally attentive whenever I seen together." "Ah! observed glances Angelica cast me, blush mantles her cheek I approach. I thought every one must observed it, though I desired keep matter secret breast I confided you. We shipmates many years, I felt sure I could trust you." "Indeed can," answered Tom. "I will give best advice I can. Do not say anything one else days; events restrain ardour, commit lady remains board. You write her, know, time, she is safe shore, captain would interfere. Perhaps, little absence, may find affection cool; for, way describe her parents, I am, friend, bound tell objections match, I sure captain would see them." "I sure I shall never love her less I now," answered Billy. "I thinking composing verses present her. As know, I something poet, I like show I give them." "Did not begin young lady Sydney?" asked Tom, slily. "I do not think ever finished them." "No, I; still, I thought completing now. You must remember young lady gave encouragement, present I know received, poetic genius stimulated. Oh, Tom! delightful love, sadly unhinges man, know experience." "Bosh! If I ever love, long ago I boy time, I forgotten it," answered Tom, quits liking Billy's remark. "But verses?" he asked. "I pocket, far I gone. I would read binnacle lamp helmsman would overhear me. I think, however, I recollect them. They begin-- "`Angelica, beloved, An earthly angel thou!' "I forget third line, fourth is-- "`Before thy shrine I bow. "`The jasmine, lily, rose, In thee entwined.' "Those third lines bother me, fourth I thought terminating `combined.' Perhaps help me, Tom?" "Could not put something sunflower poplar," suggested Tom. "The lady question rather brings mind taller productions nature. You must remarked she is head half taller are, Billy, Mrs Bubsby even major." "I might begin, `Tall art thou stately pine,' I think I bothered I introduce sunflower," observed Billy. "Give me," said Tom, "and I look over; perhaps I may get paymaster help me--he is capital hand his pen." Billy, pulling paper his pocket, gave Tom, pacing deck minutes longer went turn in, though, he averred, sleep. It mentioned Billy promoted leaving England, junior lieutenant ship. Tom, however, opportunity looking verses. The following night ship five six miles Waterloo Bay, Jack deemed prudent wait next morning stand in. Billy miserable thoughts soon part Angelica. "I say, Rogers, think captain would let go shore day two? The ship sure remain time." "I am certain that, cannot spared," answered Tom. "The captain would smell rat; depend upon that. He is sharp-sighted observed going on. I do not think he altogether admires young lady much do." "Have read remainder verses?" asked Billy. "Some lines want endings, verses want lines rhymes. My ideas grand, I apt break want appropriate rhymes." "I will find you," said Tom. "I have got dictionary, I will run eye it, select many want." "I like finished she goes shore," said Billy. "I do not see managed," observed Tom. "You send her put sea; last tender mark affection, she appreciate it. If write address envelope I get sent captain's letters." Billy contented proposal, turned his watch deck came round. At daylight _Bellona_ slowly steamed land, nearly calm, though heavy undulations rolled beneath ship towards shore. On approaching loud roar surf heard. It soon became evident would utterly impossible land troops. Jack made signal ask long state things would last. The answer unsatisfactory. It might week ten days. The troops greatly wanted, would impossible land, Captain Rogers requested keep close coast, opportunity might lost case surf unexpectedly cease. He accordingly put ship's head round, steaming off, suddenly engines stopped. The anchor, course, resource, sufficient wind enable ship claw land. As rapidly possible anchor let go. No sooner caught ground, cable run out, influence rollers began sensibly felt ship began pitching unsatisfactory manner. Astern threatening, barren-looking coast, broad line white breakers dashing savagely it. On trying current, found setting west north rate mile half hour, which, swell, would soon placed ship dangerous position. Jack went ascertain amount damage machinery, urge engineers work speed. The chief engineer looked grave. "We ought harbour, smooth water, accomplish work," he observed; "but best, sir." "Should breeze spring up, get way, ship far steady she now," answered Jack. "What accident?" "A flaw, sir, ought discovered. It wonder give way before, I cannot account going now. However, I said, sir, best." "You more, Mr Rivett," answered Jack. "Send many hands want, assist you." "Our people enough present, may want by-and-by," answer. Jack returned deck find his principal guest looking rather pale. The major often enough sea know ship caught lee shore, chance heavy gale springing up, pleasant position. He felt also somewhat physically upset unusual motion. The ship indeed riding uneasily, pulling her cable instant she might haul anchor bottom. Jack ordered another cable ranged case accident, for, bower anchor carried away, would time lose bringing up. It ill wind blows nobody good; Billy congratulating happiness spending days society Angelica, motion ship produced effect her her papa, length she appear deck, Tom remarked she looked wonderfully yellow region mouth. "I say, Billy," he observed, mischievously, "I think would appropriate compare her sunflower now." In vain Billy tried console her; she miserable speak. He length lead her door her cabin. The calm continued night, though weather looked threatening. In vain engineers toiled without ceasing. It might take two three days even damage could repaired. The night came on. The captain, first lieutenant, master felt uneasy turn in. Either second third lieutenant remained forecastle, ready issue necessary orders letting go cable, first give way. It held on, however, morning, still heavy surf rolled shore, whence, answer Jack's signals, reply came, "Troops cannot yet land." "I think, sir, long, shall breeze," said master. "I hope will not come due south; look sky I say shall south-west, perhaps westward." "I trust, get it, quarter enable us make sail," answered Jack. Still hour hour went by, breeze came. At length, towards night, ripples seen water. They became frequent. The dog vanes blew out. "Hurrah! comes breeze!" cried master. "We shall strong enough presently make sail," he added. "We may get ironwork rights." The capstan manned. Scarcely men commenced tramping round loud report heard. The messenger given way, cable ran clench, carrying away stoppers, running compressors. By great exertions, however, messenger shackled together anchor hove up. No sooner appear water Tom, forecastle, exclaimed-- "Both flukes carried away, sir; nothing shank stock remaining." Sail made; ship evidently drifting westward, she approached nearer nearer shore. Every stitch canvas could set hoisted. The wind shifted worst quarter could blow. The ship stood on, however, close-hauled, first starboard tack, then, wind shifting half point so, purpose taking advantage it, she put about. Every sheet brace flattened aft; still, judging roar breakers, she threatening coast first. Many eye turned leeward endeavour discover line coast, which, gloom, could dimly distinguished bright sky. "We still hold own," said Jack Archie Gordon, walking deck. "If continue sea goes down, may still well; must hope, let drop anchor, prove sounder last. Probably engineers time accomplished task, shall able get steam ship. She does not sail close-hauled well I expected, never opportunity testing her doing." "I suspect current carrying her leeward," observed Archie. "Possibly wind may increase daylight, shall better able claw land." All night long captain, endeavouring take advantage every change wind, frequently put ship about, anxiously wishing daylight, able judge better he could darkness her distance land. The lead kept going showed increase depth, ranged thirty-five forty fathoms. As morning approached, water shallowed, showing she nearer she night closed in. "By deep, twenty," sang man chains. A short time afterwards, "fifteen fathom," "twelve." Just daylight she ten fathoms water. As sun rose, marks denoting entrance Waterloo Bay seen lee. The bay afforded shelter wind blowing, did, directly it. Jack hoisted signals, "Can troops land?" The answer run shore was, "Not weather moderates." In short time pilot came surf-boat, ship brought nine fathoms, mile half shore. A spring also got cable, case requiring slip, bow-rope slip-rope, spare anchor shifted cathead, lieu one carried away, everything might ready case necessity. The pilot, discovering machinery given way, looked grave. He accustomed sailing vessels his life, love steamers. "I hope engineers look sharp get work done," he observed master. "This queer place wind is, though well enough it is shore." After breakfast, major his family came deck. Angelica, looking her, inquired could land. "Because boats would upset rolled breakers, you, sweet girl, would gobbled shark!" answered Billy, question put. "They would choose first. I am sure, I shark, I should not like eat papa mamma!" "Oh, dreadful idea!" exclaimed Angelica; yet she smiled she considered Billy's compliment. Billy, recovered his verses Tom, although he time look them, thought good opportunity presenting them; and, observing major's eyes turned another way, took paper his pocket gave her. "These lines, dearest, show depth affection," he said. Angelica, blush, she art commanding pleasure, took paper. A frown, however, gathered her brow she read-- "`Tall poplar, sharp thorn; I never missed never born. Roses sweet lilies fair, But lose beauty seen hair.'" "Do mean insult me?" exclaimed Angelica, angry tone, she continued read doggerel Tom substituted Billy given him. Just major, turning round, saw his daughter paper her hand, Billy standing her side. He, supposing formal proposal which, his paternal anxiety, he carefully looking for, approached intention clinching matter presence witnesses, allowing Billy chance escape. So convinced he this, that, without asking look paper, he grasped Billy's hand. "My dear fellow," he exclaimed, his enthusiasm, "I happy congratulate success good taste. She make admirable wife; prove, I sure, affectionate husband. I accept offer daughter's behalf shall blessing Mrs Bubsby." "But I made downright offer," answered Billy. "No, indeed he not," exclaimed Angelica. "Look abominable lines he presented me. What his object I cannot divine." The major took paper read lines. "Do mean insult beloved child putting wretched trash her hands?" exclaimed major, sudden revulsion feeling. "I write them," answered Billy. "Indeed I not. I wish insult Miss Angelica; I thought her charming person, got beautiful lines almost ready, I intended give her." "This satisfy me, sir," answered major. "The apology make go knees beg forgiveness innocent child, offer marry her forthwith." "That I will not," answered Billy, liked ominous frown he seen gather fair Angelica's brow, still less dictatorial tone irate major. Billy fair proportion good sense, although he made fool sometimes; was, put his mettle, brave man. His good genius suggested various remarks Tom made respecting Bubsby family. "I say I intend insult daughter, I read lines presented her, I compose myself. I must beg she give back. I ready apologise unintentional mistake, now." At juncture Mrs Bubsby her daughter joined party, set tooth nail poor Billy, literally, metaphorically. His spirit, however, up. He positively refused marry fair Angelica, offer apology he already done. "Then, sir, I must satisfaction," exclaimed major. "Your blood mine must dye soil Africa ere many days over!" "Oh! beloved husband, say that," exclaimed Mrs Bubsby. "He beneath notice. If he refuses marry Angelica, loss his. She find ere long far better husband." "You wicked, deceitful, cruel, abominable young man!" exclaimed Angelica. "If marry you will break heart! It is first time I have treated way. It shows me, however, naval officers trusted." Jack observed something unpleasant going on; he much occupied watching position ship interfere, officers. Billy also presently hurry forward attend his duties, major his wife daughters retired cabins discuss matter. By time heavy rollers coming in, breaking within cable's length ship quarter, making her position far pleasant. There light air southward, insufficient enable her get way. Jack much regretted come place, evidently far satisfactory one landing troops. The cutter lowered, sent round ship sound. On her return board master reported seven fathoms close breakers. The breeze freshened east-south-east, rollers increasing, sea broke heavily half cable's length her. Everything prepared making sail. On cable shortened in, discovered swept rock fifty fathoms anchor, moment might give way. "Stop heaving!" cried captain. "Make ready slip!" The sails loosened; sheeted home, cable parted. Instantly sheet anchor let go. For seconds seemed doubtful, could reach bottom, whether ship would strike rocks; happily brought her up, though fearfully near them. By time night; rollers greatly increased, sheet anchor give way, clear nothing could save ship. Jack seldom anxious position. All board saw danger in. The major's cheek lost ruddy hue, even Mrs Bubsby's countenance exhibited signs alarm. Not far lay small vessel anchors down. Her master coming board volunteered make hawser fast her purpose casting man-of-war right way. The engineer stated would hours steam could got up. "Then let advise you, sir, get way forthwith," said master merchantman. "Should anchor fail hold, ship must inevitably strike reef rocks surf breaking furiously, where, strong she may be, she hold together hour, slightest chance saving single human life." Jack gladly accepted worthy master's offer. The cutters lowered, hawsers carried vessel. The sheet anchor weighed, when, coming water, found flukes gone. Her hope safety remaining anchor. Would hold sail could made? From direction beats drifting soon seen that, spite efforts crews, would impossible carry hawsers merchantman. Jack looked anxiously compass dog vanes. He knew full well moment cable might part, and, ship cast right way, she must driven rocks every soul perish. "I would advise return board vessel, friend," he said master merchantman. "You safer board her here." "Now chance, captain," exclaimed master, wind veered point well eastward. The cable slipped. The ship mercifully canted right way single-reefed topsails, topgallant sails, jib, driver, strong breeze stood treacherous bay. Jack board good reason thank merciful Providence escaped danger exposed. At length _Bellona_ clear land. Now came question troops. There one anchor left. Jack considered would extreme rashness bring close shore he steam power depend help off, wind continue southward. Still greatest importance means troops landed. The major, time anxious leave ship, insisted "it ought done, must done." "The _must_ depends upon circumstances," answered Jack. "If I land men I will, without risking lives boats' crews. By running eastward, place may found put shore, must march thence place ordered garrison, machinery good working order, I must utmost keep land." To major nothing say. The breeze freshened. By nightfall _Bellona_ sight land, Jack felt much easy he done several days. Although rough seas greatly delayed engineer, he length able report machinery order. The wind also fallen considerably, sea much gone down, Jack hoped he might length get rid his guests. Both officers men behaved admirably, assisted occasions making sail, pulling hauling required deck. The ship was, time, forty miles port debarkation. After many anxious hours watching, Jack turned in, leaving Tom, officer watch, deck. Young Alick Murray placed Tom's watch, besides mate another midshipman. The night tolerably clear, stars shining, mist hung surface sea, object could seen tolerably near. Tom constantly hailed look-outs forward ascertain keeping eyes open, young Alick paid frequent visits forecastle, sent Tom purpose. The engines working, though satisfactory manner desirable. Alick forward, his sharp eyes discovered object almost ahead, though slightly starboard bow. "What is that?" he asked, pointing Tim Nolan, watch. "A boat, raft, sunken vessel?" "It looks like raft, must starboard helm do not want run it," said Tim. "A raft starboard bow!" shouted Alick, his clear voice. "Starboard helm!" "Starboard is," answer, presently looked like hen-coop grating spars lashed together, came sight, object, evidently human being, lying it, whether alive dead could ascertained. Presently, however, ship abreast raft, man rose his knees waved his hand, he shouted out, "Ship, ahoy!" His voice sounded hollow shrill; he apparently supposed he seen. Tom immediately ordered engines stopped, boat lowered, done she got considerable distance raft. Another cry escaped forlorn occupant raft, he fancied he left his fate. Tom hailed him, telling assistance would sent. In minutes boat pulling fast crew, sturdy strokes--eager rescue fellow-creature-- could drive her water. Alick jumped boat, he steered carefully raft. No voice heard approached. The poor man, overcome thought he deserted, apparently fainted sunk weakness. At first Alick thought he there, his form seen stretched full length frail raft. "Look capsize it!" sang Alick his men, two spring raft. "Let one time get it, lift man carefully boat." His orders obeyed, man got board passed along stern sheets, he laid his head flag, happened boat. Alick pulled back hard possible, stranger might placed charge doctor. The poor man breathed, all. Alick afraid he might go unless speedily attended to, boat come away without brandy restorative. The rescued man handed deck tenderness sailors will not treat sick wounded, women children. The doctor immediately roused he considered necessary. The stranger seemed his dress officer, although, whether officer man, he would looked care. Tom carried his cabin, doctor undressed him. The various remedies his case required applied, stranger soon gave signs returning animation. "His pulse improving," observed doctor, "and he well enough time. No one must talk him, however, he comes his senses, try learn he got situation he found." Tom's watch over, given his cabin he roll his cloak corner ward room, fearful cry "Fire! fire!" raised. He hurried deck, Jack officers crew quickly assembled. The drum beat quarters. The men flew stations. The soldiers, well knew meaning tattoo, hastened deck fell in, according officers' orders, either side. During moment awful suspense, strict discipline prevailed. The last persons appear major Mrs Bubsby two tall daughters. The former, blanket thrown his head, making look much like young polar bear, lady her nightcap, bonnet secured red woollen shawl fastened her chin, costume young ladies showed also hurriedly dressed themselves, way would wished appeared in, ordinary circumstances, one her papa's military cloak tied round her waist, railway rug, large size, covering her shoulders hanging behind. "What is matter? what is matter?" asked major, tone agitation. "The ship fire, we, aid men, put out," said Jack. "Fire!" exclaimed Mrs Bubsby. "Oh, dear! oh, dear! become us. I thought thing impossible board well-regulated man-of-war." Jack time reply lady. That ship fire certain, could perceive strong smell burning, although smoke could seen darkness, suffocating effects felt ascended hatch-way. Jack ordered first lieutenant boatswain party men go ascertain extent fire, soldiers stood ready buckets full water hands, party crew, wet blankets sails, extinguish it. No sooner hatch taken off, however, smoke bright flames ascended. On soldiers, standing lower deck, ordered advance heave contents buckets spot. At first appeared produce little effect. The steam pump set work hose carried aft, scarcely begun work, machinery accident gave way, service. The major, seeing serious aspect affairs, length rushed Jack. "Captain Rogers, become wife daughters?" he asked, agitated tone. "We lower one boats, put it," said captain, "with senior mate midshipman." Jack issued order cutter lowered manned. Her crew went her officers Jack appointed. "Murray, go too," he said. "We take board soon fire put out." Alick touched his cap, evidently unwilling go, though he said nothing. "The boat ready, major, wife daughters," shouted Jack. The accommodation ladder lowered enable descend. "Now, precious ones," cried major. "Your lives shall saved events, though it is belief ship burn water's edge go down." Billy busy attending his duty assist his fair friends; indeed, he would sorry keep way he known taking place. Mrs Bubsby first descend, helped two crew, could moment spared assist her. The eldest daughter went next, major descended, supporting Angelica, who, overcome her feelings, appeared fainted. When crew offered assist her boat, he exclaimed-- "No, no, hands off, I must place her her mother's arms," stepped in, without risk pitching stern sheets. Jack, looked side, observing one else remained get boat, ordered her shove off. "But major her, sir," answered Alick. "He must go back dreadful ship!" cried Mrs Bubsby, her words echoed her daughters, Angelica, throwing her arms round his neck, held down. In vain major struggled, appeared struggle, regain accommodation ladder, time he made attempt get board, his wife daughters pulled back. While going forward, boat veered astern long warp, major attempted shout, his wife placed her hand his mouth, his demands taken board unheeded. At length, appearing reconciled his fate, he subsided remained quietly his wife family, without effort return ship. "It cannot helped, sir," said young Alick. "They will well without you, quite men enough put fire. I wish, though, I board help." "Do think chance ship blowing up?" said Mrs Bubsby. "If I am afraid shall lose things." "You may sure, madam, ship blow lose everything, I cannot help thinking lives officers crew, speak poor soldiers, consequence traps," answered Alick. "Oh dear! oh dear! ship blow up, suppose?" inquired Angelica. "And poor Lieutenant Blewitt, become him?" "I suppose Billy must share fate others," answered Alick. "But I assure I fear she blow up. Her crew well-disciplined, soldiers appear equally so, judging way behaving left ship, matter precaution, case accident, Captain Rogers put boat, probable shall board hour so, less time." "Do venture call Lieutenant Blewitt `Billy?'" exclaimed Angelica, whose tender besom full amount affection she ever felt returned friend, supposing he peril might lost her ever. "I beg pardon, Miss Angelica. I forgot I spoke he spooney other," answered Alick, perfect gravity. "I confess always call `Billy' berth, duty address due respect `Lieutenant Blewitt'; lieutenants, however, always speak `Billy Blueblazes,' he likes name, he got accustomed it." Meantime, far could ascertained boat, fire continued burning board ship. Sparks seen occasionally rising deck, Alick began entertain serious apprehensions ship would destroyed. Some her crew might escape boats, he sure officers would last leave her, would impossible construct rafts convey all. He ready time joke even laugh. He became serious. The fire might reach magazine, though he felt sure Captain Rogers would order drowned powder thrown overboard, could done. Meantime Jack his command making every effort men could make extinguish fire. It discovered originated bunkers, flames got hold wood-work. By persevering efforts extinguished, Tom, covering his head piece wet blanket, followed Jerry Bird gallant party seamen similarly protected, made way, buckets hand, seat fire. Again driven back, Jerry, stout-hearted he was, hoisted senseless deck, overcome smoke; two others suffering manner, Tom rest persevering. He ready perish rather allow Jack's ship destroyed. More volunteers called for. At length, united efforts, one party overcome, another taking place, fire got under, bunk cooled water, coals scraped out. By time sun rising horizon, casting bright glare ship, she slowly moved calm water. Jack naval military officers still deck, many faces hands blackened, well clothing, smoke, ship herself presented far her usual trim appearance. The boat hauled alongside. The first appear major, still wearing his blanket, he forgotten throw aside, recollecting curious figure he cut. His officers turned him, disgusted supposed his pusillanimity his desertion his men; naval officers laughed his unusual somewhat absurd costume. He followed his two daughters, Mrs Major Bubsby bringing rear, though might wiser her led van. Her curious appearance lessen merriment seen her, crew standing near way attempted restrain laughter. "What is about?" asked major, indignant tone. He acute perceive effect his conduct produced his officers, he determined brazen out. "You think I deserted you, gentlemen," he said. "You much mistaken. I victim affection. My beloved wife daughters kept unwilling prisoner. I put you, gentlemen, would behaved similar circumstances? I made strenuous efforts regain deck, two dear girls mine clung frantic energy, Mrs Bubsby held main force." "I did, I it," exclaimed Mrs Bubsby, who, danger over, saw dubious position her husband placed. "My deep affection overcame every consideration, I thought safety beloved husband. My daughters animated spirit." "Yes, are. We thought would burnt, blown up, go bottom, poor dear Lieutenant Blewitt bargain; could endure thoughts losing papa, held tight, though he brave strong lion. It difficult thing keep down, I assure you;" Angelica burst tears. Whether produced effect hard hearts captains subalterns regiment impossible say. "I advise you, major, Mrs Bubsby go turn in, change dress, quite becoming deck man-of-war, I hope daughters follow example," observed Jack, thought matters proceeding far. It impossible stop shouts laughter escaped ship's company as, one another, managed get look curious group. "I take advice, Captain Rogers," answered major, he, followed his tall family, disappeared. The ship received less damage might expected, machinery injured, she proceeded towards her destination. Next day she came small, land-locked, bay. The master, careful pilotage, brought her in, she anchored safely. Jack breathed sigh relief he thought he get rid major his family, well troops, admirably behaved board. The officers thanked courtesy he shown them. They eyed major, standing little distance, looks askance. "What shall commanding officer I tell," said senior captain. "I sorry, Captain Rogers, bad specimen military man board ship. Were superior officers shore, bring court-martial, would necessity carrying his belongings back. As is, face enemy, cannot refuse serve him, hope his wife daughters cling round his neck keep head-quarters, shot may disable active service. A little thing would, I suspect, that. We wish ill." "I willing oblige everything," said Jack, laughing; "but I would rather pleasure carrying his `woman kind,' he calls them, back Simon's Bay." The boats busily employed landing soldiers, bade affectionate farewell blue-jacket brethren. Most officers landed; major his family still remained. He appeared arrived conclusion he stand well his command. Had ship gone down, he would saved his life, would nobody complain; was, real danger, he found placed awkward position. Of he well aware. He came Jack. "Age infirmity told upon lately, Captain Rogers," he said. "Mrs Bubsby daughters opinion. My charming daughter Angelica anxious go back Cape Town. I have, therefore, come conclusion resigning command returning home, whatever may consequences." "Are speaking seriously?" asked Jack. "Have considered consequences act? I thought would anxious retrieve character showing courage first time opportunity meeting enemy." "_My_ courage!" exclaimed major; "who ever doubted that? It courage gave way; stout arms affectionate embraces beloved daughters kept back boat thought ship going down. My courage honour bright ever best days, I known perfect fire-eater. Do know I Crimea--how gallantly I behaved storming Sevastopol? I held rifle-pits host enemy? Alma I climbed heights, shouting `Death victory!' men driven back showers bullets hissing past us might fled? Why, sir, officer deserved Victoria Cross, I did!" "I heard brave deeds, Major Bubsby," answered Jack, "and duty land wife daughters nearest place destination. The state surf prevented Waterloo Bay, I inform boat waiting convey family shore. Your heavy baggage already sent off; remains carried you." The major looked aghast. "Surely, Captain Rogers, mean say insist landing, whether I like not, would compel delicate wife fair young creatures march thirty miles sands Africa without conveyance baggage?" "Duty duty, major," answered Jack, determined take back he could help it. "Your duty land, mine put shore. You will excuse saying this, I intend perform duty." The major, seeing he help it, made virtue necessity. He called his wife-- "We must go, beloved, sweet children must exposed fearful dangers unknown land." On hearing Mrs Bubsby approached Jack, stood boldly prepared assault he every reason expect frown gathered lady's brow. "Captain Rogers!" she exclaimed, voice made Jack answer-- "Madam!" He time say more, she went on-- "Have you, belong sister service, barbarity refuse passage beloved husband delicate daughters, request made you? For myself, I care not; I march wherever regiment go. I expect you; I would know I consider conduct worthy officer gentleman." "Madam!" ejaculated Jack, "I must submit language, even lady. I simply perform duty, land Major Bubsby his family. If he go, I sorry hoist side; I intend so." Mrs Bubsby plucked her gloves. Jack looked her hands; her nails long, captain man-of-war likely assaulted deck his ship, even lady. Still Jack could tell might irate dame's intention. The fair Angelica cast glance Lieutenant Blewitt, standing gangway, hoping heartily honour handing her her sister accommodation ladder, uttering last farewell, he averted his eyes he saw his charmer fixed him. The major began seriously alarmed his wife, whose temper he full experience, might proceed extremities, would better face scorn his officers assegais Caffres ignominiously tumbled side. "Come, come, beloved! Captain Rogers knows his duty. He fulfils sternly, I must say; still must obey; march!" In mean time Archie Gordon, received directions Jack, seeing light baggage major conveyed boat. He sent Alick say ready. The major saw excuse delay. "Farewell, Captain Rogers," he said, lifting his hat. "Farewell, gentlemen. You see doomed man!" he marched gangway. "Oh, cruel! cruel!" uttered Mrs Bubsby, exclamation repeated Eugenia Angelica. "Give her another copy verses," whispered Tom Billy, "or repeat I wrote you." "I forget them, I would," said Billy. "Good-bye, Miss Angelica," he added, young lady passed averted countenance, deigning reply. The major descended boat. He would still greater hurry he known he expect landing. He thoughts throwing overboard; fin shark gliding turned his intention. The ladies followed; took seats put handkerchiefs eyes, whether weep parting naval officers account harsh treatment, impossible say. Alick, steered boat, declared he think crying all. The major sat silent moody time. Once he got up, "with fury his countenance," Alick afterwards described; his wife daughters pulled down, length he landed safe beach, various articles baggage carried spot sergeant party men standing ready escort camp already pitched advantageous position inland. They might time attacked Caffres; force sufficient keep bay number enemy likely part country. "Have message send Lieutenant Blewitt, Miss Angelica?" asked Alick, touching his cap perfect gravity lady, walking last; he already wished major rest "Good-bye." "Yes; tell he base deceiver," answered Angelica, "and I hope he may catch tartar next time he attempts make love innocent maiden presenting her his abominable verses." "Yes, miss," answered Alick; "I will faithfully deliver message." And he ordered return without delay, he hurried back boat. "Well, Alick, say?" asked Tom, he returned board. Alick described happened, fail repeat Miss Angelica's message Lieutenant Blewitt. "I would rather deliver myself. Perhaps will, sir, may appear somewhat disrespectful coming me," added midshipman. "All right," said Tom, chuckling. "I will take care he gets it." Tom took opportunity, officers collected mess table, deliver Miss Angelica's message. Billy laughed heartily one. "I do not care she called me, I rid her. I am much obliged you, Rogers, verses, although I confess time I certainly feel considerably annoyed." Jack, got rid his guests, anxious repair damage caused fire, without delay steamed harbour proceeded his voyage Simon's Bay. The man picked fire broke carefully tended surgeon. During whole time efforts made extinguish it, he remained state insensibility, recovered troops landed. Tom, whose berth he occupied, visited frequently, found ill able converse even give account himself. At length, refreshing sleep, he awoke greatly recovered. "I understand doctor, sir," he said, Tom soon afterwards went see him, "that placed berth, I wish keep longer possible. I ruined man, must expect longer enjoy comforts life, I retrieve fortunes, ever done." "Pray consider inconvenienced me," answered Tom. "I happy service you. All know found nearly perishing, happy render aid power. We naturally somewhat curious know came floating raft." "That is natural, sir. My story long one. My name Cooper. I master part owner fine barque, _Flora_, trading Hobart Town, Tasmania. I coming home southern route, thick weather sighted rock laid chart. I call rock, rather small island rising lofty precipices sea. The weather clearing, somewhat surprise I made signal flying flag-staff, standing close I could see glass small hut. Believing shipwrecked people there, I stood still closer in, sudden squall struck vessel, laid her her beam ends. She righted without much damage, far could discovered; weather coming bad, I obliged keep shore. I made second attempt, driven off, soon afterwards heavy gale ever I experienced coming southward, lost main mizzen masts, nearly fore-topmast, I compelled run it. I hopes getting Simon's Bay, carpenter came reported eight feet water hold. I sent crew pumps, efforts could free ship, water kept rushing fearful rapidity. A butt started. A heavy sea running time, I hoped boats would live. I ordered lowered cry arose ship sinking. A panic seized crew, hands rushed sides. Some leaped one boat, another. Almost immediately boats swamped, I misery see poor fellows drowned eyes. I alone remained deck. The ship floated longer I expected, I time lash together imperfect raft found me, get overboard, leap upon it, biscuits I stuffed pockets bottle water. Had I taken I must perished. How I could existed whole week, I did, I know not; I must far gone, mercy Heaven found me." "You indeed escaped terrible danger," said Tom. "But I wish could given perfect information rock saw signal flying, position." "I noted time, sir, log lost, events since occurred put many things head, though I trying vain recall it. I remember clearly many weeks' sail Hobart Town, far I ran sighting rock; nor, indeed, long I must raft, though I retained consciousness seemed age. On considering matter, I conclude gale could lasted much less week, perhaps longer." Tom, obtaining important information, communicated Jack, immediately went Captain Cooper, conversation him. "It within range possibilities _Empress_ may lost rock sighted Captain Cooper, though she could got far east, she hauled long Aden, difficult say," observed Jack, afterwards talking matter lieutenant master. "Probably her machinery broke down, did." "And meeting gale, she run it," remarked master. "These steam-kettles never depended upon. I wish could go back good old sailing ships. When knew about, took good care keep lee shore; or, came blow, hove ship rode comfortably. Now trust machinery, fails us time need. I should not like say engineer, he sticks his engines, wonders ships used cross ocean got steam power." Jack smiled. The master thorough seaman, he allowed always his say "new-fangled notions day," he called them. Both Gordon Tom agreed master great probability _Empress_ lost rock seen Captain Cooper, she touched Aden heard eastward. Some her crew might escaped, although probable many lost, Adair among them; he certainly would quitted wreck last--they knew well suppose that. "The signal seen Captain Cooper may, however, hoisted people escaped wreck," observed Tom. "Perhaps _Empress_ went gale lost sight her," said master. "I trust case; she likely keep afloat were, unless unforeseen accident happened--" "To machinery," put master. "If steam shut Captain Adair trusted his stout canvas, I fear subject." "Heaven forbid she foundered. If she did, shall never obtain proof positive fact," said captain. "I far rather inclined believe she struck unknown reef, rock island reached boats, ship herself gained it, unless much damaged continue her voyage. One thing I determined soon repairs completed, obtain leave go search her, unfortunate persons rock, shall events satisfaction rescuing them." Fortunately weather continued fine, _Bellona_, without misadventure, reached Simon's Bay. The repairs, however, took longer expected, damage received far serious first supposed. However, work could accomplished ship Simon's Bay. "Take care machinery do not break again, Mr Rivett," observed Mr Scales, master, generally known Gunter Scale. "We have got ticklish part ocean navigate, I tell you, engines fail moment wanted back astern coral reef, keep ship drifted lee shore, I shall not much say favour." "I beg, Mr Scales, take ship position. I understood every rock shoal us south pole well laid down, fault come upon danger without knowing beforehand." "You wrongly informed, Mr Rivett; many rock, many shoal, many island, too, us pole one alive knows anything about, although many poor fellow found late, his ship run right upon them." "What say reminds Irish pilot told captain ship he taking anchorage, he knew every rock coast. The captain doubted him, five minutes afterwards ship went crash upon one. `Bedad! I tould honour I knew thim, an' that is one thim. There is many rock I have found manner,'" said Tom, thought better put end discussion. "I hope shall find none fashion," said Mr Rivett. "That depend machinery," said Mr Gunter Scale, chuckling. "We shall keep bright look-out ahead lead going, piston rods boilers prove faithful, well good. If not, I cannot warrant ship keep danger screw run us. Let her canvas I will know I will go I will go, I will answer I will not run ship charge place her sails cannot take her again." "Then perfect confidence machinery?" observed Mr Rivett. "No, I not, I wonder expect have. I say again, give tough masts, sound spars, well set-up rigging, stout canvas, properly built ship feet, I will keep sea weathers, carry her safely round world." The discussion might continued many hours officers summoned respective duties. Jack, according his intention, reported admiral account he received Captain Cooper, afterwards repeated it. "I am afraid little chance finding missing ship, events shall go search her," answer. The repairs length completed, _Bellona_ sailed search _Empress_. CHAPTER SEVENTEEN. THE EMPRESS LOSES SIGHT OF THE BELLONA--A GALE--SAILS BLOWN AWAY--RUNS BEFORE THE WIND--A LEAK--THE PUMPS MANNED--CREW SET TO BALE--PAT'S DREAM--PETE DISCOVERS THE LEAK--A THRUMMED SAIL GOT UNDER THE BOTTOM-- ANOTHER LEAK--THE GALE INCREASES--STEER FOR VIRGINIA ISLAND--ALL HANDS SPELL AND SPELL--THE SHIP PASSES OVER A REEF--FALSE KEEL CARRIED AWAY-- THE WATER GAINS ON THEM--ADAIR ADDRESSES THE CREW--THE MIDSHIPMAN AND SHIP'S BOY WITH THEIR WATER JUGS--LAND IN SIGHT--REACHED AT NIGHT--A BEACON FIRE APPEARS ON SHORE--SHIP DRIFTS FROM HER ANCHOR--SURMISES AS TO ITS BEING FLY-AWAY ISLAND--THE SHIP REGAINS AN ANCHORAGE--TWO BOATS SENT ON SHORE--GREEN GRASPS THE HAND OF LORD SAINT MAUR--STORES AND PART OF THE CREW LANDED--THE SHIP AGAIN DRIVEN OFF THE SHORE. We must go back _Empress_, left somewhere Tropic Capricorn, heavy gale wind, approaching hurricane. The weather come thick, she soon lost sight her consort, heavy sea got compelled Captain Adair either heave ship run wind. He chose former alternative, steam still kept up. Waiting lull, he brought her wind close-reefed main-topsail. Heavy ship she was, deep water stores provisions sorts, she ride comfortable fashion old wooden frigate. A fierce blast blew her canvas ribbons, sea striking her carried away bulwarks forward, swept her deck, knocking two her boats pieces, serious damage. Her screw working brought her again, consequences might still serious. It took long time strength could applied set another sail, ship time rode rather easily. She thus continued hove couple days, weather way moderating. Adair felt anxious _Bellona_, he hoped seen, aware running south he would got gale she did. Many good seaman similar circumstances made mistake. Suddenly engines stopped. Adair sent inquire because. Part machinery got gear, engineer reported would soon order ship could induced remain steady time. "He might well tell us land his engines set forge shop," observed Jos Green, master, greater affection "steam-kettles" old Gunter Scale, his brother master _Bellona_. The ship uncomfortable position, say best another blast might blow away second topsail, she fell oil would difficult task bring her wind again; her resource would run gale. The danger apprehended came upon her: ship fell trough sea. "Hold on, hold on, lives!" shouted Adair, he saw heavy wave come rolling on. It struck ship, decks swept, two poor fellows, failed obey captain's orders, carried away without slightest hope rescued. Adair sent below; he received answer engineer. Meantime attempt made set head sail. As she thus lay sea broke her several times, damage. The well sounded, carpenter reported four feet water hold. The donkey engine immediately set work. Fortunately, refusing duty, time operation gained water. In mean time another main-topsail set attempt made wear ship. Suddenly wind shifted north-west, filling sails sorely battered ship she flew it, though heavy broken seas rolled astern threatened moment poop her. The engineer complained bitterly way ship tumbled about. "Never mind now, good fellow," said Green; "we snug canvas much carry, engines may rest. By-and-by shall get calm; turn then. We seamen ship present. If put Simon's Bay, happens rollers tumbling in, time enough put gimcrack machinery rights." "That is old Gunter Scale would said," observed engineer, served _Bellona_, accustomed his satirical remarks. The ship, however, destined touch Cape, one terrific gales occasionally blow African coast caught her within hundred miles land, covering her deck fine impalpable sand, her canvas depend upon, she driven far southward would compelled her go considerably her way she hauled Cape. She fell trade wind, carried her sail eastward, Adair, hoping regain lost time, continued course longitude Madagascar, outside he intended stand, avoiding Mozambique Channel, probably, necessary, touch Mauritius, he could get his engines repaired. Once more, however, another gale, inferior power she already encountered, came north-west. The battered _Empress_ ill-prepared encounter it. The donkey engine kept going, water hitherto considerably increased, still evident serious leak existed somewhere, although yet ascertained. Adair his lieutenant, well carpenter boatswain, made repeated efforts discover exact spot. The way creep bunkers among bilge water, unpleasant dangerous task. It evident water must reduced leak could discovered. The word given man chain pumps, bilge pumps also set motion, double line men formed buckets could found board, main-deck hold, bale water, one line passing empty buckets handing full ones, almost quickly chain pump could done it. The men worked will, knew full well danger exposed. Perfect discipline, however, maintained; one showed slightest sign fear, one complained. Adair shipped among his crew old acquaintances Pat Casey Peter black, last-named stoker, better able perform office Englishmen. With one two exceptions, remaining stokers either Irishmen Germans, latter aptitude becoming stokers sugar bakers, avocations require power enduring heat. The gale continued increase, spite efforts crew water rushed furiously before. Even engines order, would impossible steam back wind Cape, great question whether ship could kept afloat Mauritius--the nearest land--could reached. Adair Jos Green anxiously examined chart. "Should wind shift points westward, might manage sail, present circumstances thing done keep ship gale," observed master. In parts ocean sea heavy latitude _Empress_ was, except, perhaps, southward Cape Horn. All pumps set going, fresh party told bale water iron hand-buckets. These hoisted rate seventy hour. "Set fiddle fife going, keep spirits men," said Adair first lieutenant, issued order. Presently merry notes heard amid howling gale, sounding strangely, yet inspiriting crew. Still, spite could done, water rose higher higher. "Peter," said Pat Casey his old shipmate, when, toiling four hours, knocked get little rest, "it is opinion last cruise I shall take together. I have many mighty quare fix now, niver one like this. Sure, there is nothing I hate ship hole her bottom, an' that is we have got, an' pretty big one, I am thinkin'." "You gib up, Pat," answered Peter. "We fall 'nother ship, sight land, get 'shore, stop de leak. When de cap'n finds de ship make much water, he keep her 'float fixin' sail her." "You may say ye plaise, sail could thrummed an' passed her keel, she will many fathoms depths ocean. An' supposin' fall ship, sure, could get aboard her sea runnin'? Then, reaching land-- where is land reach? I niver heard speak land away south'ard, except icy pole, an' niver see wished ever much." "Dat may de case; I nebber could make de meanin' ob chart, wheneber I hab de Pacific, find many islands, tink dere mus' here'bout. Why down-hearted?" "Down-hearted it, sure? I am down-hearted, Pater; I will tell ye, I dreamed dream night gale came on, I lay hammock; ould mither--who is gone glory six years--came stood side, an' I saw her face clearly I see yours, an' says she, `Tim, son, I have come wake you;' says I, `Mither, what is for?' Says she, `I wake ye well, although I cannot give ye dacent burial.' Upon she sit howlin' I thought would heard along deck. Says I, `Mither, hold fast there, you will afther disturbin' whole watch below.' But she would not, an' still howled on, jist I mind th' women ould Ireland whin I boy. Again I sung out, `Mither, ye love me, hold peace. I do not want waked now,' I uttered words I heard boatswain pipe hands deck, sure wind was not shrieking, an' blocks rattling, an' masts groaning, showin' dacent hurricane blowin'. Me mither vanished immediately, an' I tumbled deck, asleep thin awake, thinkin' good soul saying me." Peter fell asleep Pat talking, brief time summoned take spell baling. All efforts discover leak hitherto vain. Peter went chief engineer. "Pardon, sir, tink find de leak. If black Peter get drowned, easily find better man take place." "I shall glad do, Peter, I suspect leak found shall drowned together," said engineer. "What propose doing?" "Jus' dive de water, wid rope round waist, an' bright light held go down. You see, sir, lantern burn de water, take down." "You might possibly succeed; I fear lose life," answered engineer. "But shall try like." "All right, ear," said Peter, "me try, matter happen." The engineer reported captain offer black. Adair allowed make attempt, ordered gunner bring several blue-lights, well dozen ship's lanterns, he, his first lieutenant, chief engineer, gunner, boatswain, three men hold rope, went below, Peter stood prepared his undertaking. The hatches overhead taken allow fumes blue-lights escape. "Now," cried Peter, "me ready," slipping water, he disappeared beneath it. A blue-light instantly ignited, bright glare must, hoped, penetrate bottom ship. It seemed impossible standing Peter could exist beneath black fluid surged him. The seconds went slowly by, second appearing almost like minute. The doctor, come down, kept his watch his hand. Adair expected every moment give signal drawing man. "The poor fellow drowned he stays longer," observed Adair. "He endure twenty-five seconds more," answered doctor. "We must time, he return." "Haul up," cried Adair; "he cannot stand longer." Just he spoke, black's head appeared water. "Me find next time," he said, drawing deep breath. In couple minutes Peter declared ready descend. Another blue-light burned, irradiating depths below. As before, doctor watched time Peter water. Two minutes passed, Adair ordered man hauled up. It moment soon. At first, his appearance, supposed he drowned, doctor began prepare resuscitate him, he came himself. "All right!" he exclaimed; "de leak found, big 'nough put hand through." Peter, soon he regained his strength, showed exact spot hole existed, water spouting hose. Adair satisfied black right. The question stop it. The carpenter got plugs ready, Peter averred human power could force in, unless pressure water first taken outside. The way getting thrummed sail ship's bottom. The engineer suggested iron plate screwed on, difficulty screw proper position. He proposed fixing iron bar plate securing end beam it. The plate quickly prepared he suggested, though prevented water spouting upwards done, found entrance notwithstanding, plate ship's bottom. Adair gave orders sail thrummed. The operation follows: A sail stretched masses oakum fastened one side, give appearance large rug great thickness. Strong ropes secured four corners; dragged ship's bottom, when, force water rushing in, sucked leak, although water still finds way through, calculated greatly impede entrance. Happily came lull, ropes got ship's bows, dragged part leak existed reached, thrummed sail hauled bottom, firmly secured. A hundred hands told bale different hatchways canvas buckets, sailmaker's crew men employed making supplement iron ones. Adair anxiously watched result labours. "If weather improves shall well yet," observed Green first lieutenant. "One see much prospect that," answer. The sky indeed gloomy ever, wind blew perfect hurricane, thick mist spray flew deck wetted every one skin. As hours went relaxation hard-worked crew. The seamen marines, engineers, stokers, well officers, laboured away short intervals rest. No sooner men relieved, than, overcome exertions, threw deck waited turn again. The carpenter reported water diminishing. "We ought, howsumever, got ship time have," he observed. "To mind, must another leak somewhere." Adair feared carpenter right, Peter, hearing his opinion, volunteered grope he could discover it. The precautions taken save destruction. He persevered he utterly exhausted doctor declared unfit go below. Though he succeeded, Adair thanked his gallant conduct, promised overlooked. "Me berry happy, cap'n, de ship get harbour. No want reward," answered brave negro. Scarcely thrummed sail got ship, began blow hard ever. Should gale continue many days longer, hope saving ship must given up, probably every soul board would perish. Adair conceal himself, although neither word look he show passing his mind. There rocks, rather islands, he knew southward, one might possibly reached, much depended state weather. Should sea go down, ship might kept afloat, he could hope get back Cape even Mauritius. At present he could steer course directly wind. On examining chart, he discovered 200 miles southward east rock marked Virginia Island, he could find description it. Whether sides precipitous could scaled, whether low easy access, whether possessed harbour description, word said. It might barren rock without water, means affording sustenance even small number men. He could scarcely expect otherwise, latitude, he knew, exposed icy blasts southern pole, vegetation would stunted destroyed, he could scarcely entertain hope springs existed. Still nearest land description, land eagerly sought board foundering ship. He aware rocks latitude product volcanic action, likewise he little doubt; case, improbable water would found. Poor Adair felt his position keenly. Through fault his, lives entrusted placed jeopardy. Often often his thoughts went wandering away his dear Lucy. Although he would allowed fear losing his life oppress him, he could help dreading idea plunging her grief exposing her long months anxious suspense. Still his officers, watched his calm countenance brisk manner, fancied he light-hearted ever, thought he could realised fearful position placed. They running across little-known sea. The chart showed dangers, marked somewhat uncertain. Still storm-driven ship could pursue course. A hundred miles least yet accomplished island hoped sight could reached; even prove correctly marked chart, Green doubt sighting it. The ship might pass yet might seen, gale, continuing, might drive her headlong force, she might able haul time get lee. Twelve fourteen hours would decide point, perhaps even less. The wind begun moderate slightly, older hands board, accustomed southern ocean, prognosticated change weather. All prayed might come. Night returned, brought rest labouring crew. Every man boy board, except look-out, engaged pumping baling, unless lying recruiting strength renewed exertions. They working spell spell, knowing full well unless done, ship could kept afloat. As she recommissioned undergone thorough repair, one could account leak. Many anything bless ship-builders. Some declared outer coat wood rotten, inner one iron become corroded patched deceive eye surveyor. "Bedad! I belave must one thim big fishes long noses run us, an' drilled hole he could get again," said rat Casey his shipmate Peter; "or, maybe, big say sarpint swimmin' gave us whisk his tail unbeknown." "Me tink, Massa Pat, dey make officer, eber get harbour, swear dat." "Faith, boy, swear, it?" observed Pat. "It is th' sort yarn dockyard matey would swear to, plaise his superiors; there is one thing I believe, an' is, wood an' iron rotten. Bad luck thim did not repair damage whin found out! You opinion, though would not become ye say so. All you would got find hole was, an' ye like brave man, an' sure I would sorry get home, you would afther losin' reward." What reflections might cast dockyard officials impossible say, grating sound heard, ship quivered fore aft. For moment her way seemed stopped, cry rose many mouth, "We lost! lost!" A tremendous sea came rolling astern. "Hold on, lives!" shouted Adair, order echoed along decks. The wave struck vessel's stern. A portion broke her, next moment she driven forward. That fearful, dread-inspiring sound, tells keel come contact hard rock, continued. Every instant Adair dreaded terrific crash would come would denote doom board. Still he stood calm, apparently unmoved, before. "Keep stations, lads! yet let old ship go down," shouted Adair. The order repeated along deck. The magnificent discipline prevails British navy, even terrible moment, triumphed. Not man deserted his post, continued pumping baling away rugged reef beneath ship's keel. Several times she rose surged onwards, feel rock still her. On she went. At instant wind began abate, even sea calmer she touched reef. Still could doubted she received serious injury. As howling tempest abated, Adair could make his voice heard along decks. "My lads," he said, "I know true British seamen. Things may bad enough, must give way despair. Maintain discipline justly proud, obey officers, do not give plank remains water. The weather moderating, soon calm enough try discover amount damage ship received. Stick pumps buckets, see cannot heave water her faster comes in. Now, turn again!" The men, Adair speaking, knocked minutes. He saw, however, he gained time, energy set work, he showing example handing along buckets, his officers. Adair Green, however, knock try take observation, clouds gave signs breaking, hoped every moment see sun burst forth. It all-important indeed ascertain ship's exact position chart, might steer nearest spot she might, necessary, beached, events lee she might anchor, endeavour made repair damages. Whether could done could ascertained thorough examination her bottom yet possible. The midshipmen summoned assist. Adair his officers stood sextants hands ready note sun's altitude he burst forth, first lieutenant watched chronometer. The tossing seas rose round labouring ship. They already lost leaden hue, bright green tints could seen, crests longer hissed foamed before. Suddenly, stroke magician's wand, clouds parted, bright sun shone forth clear space blue. The men deck cheered saw it. To seemed augury safety. A satisfactory observation taken, exact longitude obtained, noon would find true latitude, then, Virginia Island laid correctly, might steer confidence towards it. According chart, still eastward, might, ship run far south, sighted night. Noon anxiously waited for. The crew continued labouring away energy before, though case energy despair. Again Adair took his place line men passing buckets down. Still efforts avail lessen amount water within ship, kept increasing-- something. As long strength held out, might continue that. Every one knew that, relax efforts, water would conquer them; great point keep sufficiently low prevent fires put out. Should occur calm come on, case would desperate, even though sight land. Some, true, might saved boats others rafts, ship float long enough enable constructed, bulk--two-thirds, probably--must doomed perish. Adair knew he must among latter. While soul remained board, he could quit his ship. Dear life might him, sake others must sacrificed. When also trying moment come, would discipline maintained? Would crew scramble boats swamp them? leap headlong rafts render useless? Frequently captain master looked watches. Once returned poop, sextants hand. Noon approaching. Clouds still passing slowly across sky; might probably rest sun ship, rendering impossible take observation. The officers watched progress. A large cloud floating by; would pass onwards sun gained extreme altitude? "Now, master!" cried Adair, cheerful tone. The western edge cloud, tinged golden hue, seen, sun came forth. The captain Green first lieutenant sextants eyes moment: sun still rising. "It dipped!" cried Adair. They carefully noted latitude, Green, seconds, worked observation little slip paper, bigger one's thumb nail. Hurrying below, chart got out, exact position ship obtained. "Hurrah! If volcano island does not prove fly-away piece rock, shall sunset," exclaimed Green. The wind sufficiently gone allow sail set. The part crew knocked pumps buckets roused up. With greatest alacrity, usual rest, flew stations. The topsails courses, long furled, let fall sheeted home; staysails hoisted, screw thus aided, ship rushed rapidly water. She steered, however, difficulty; Green expressed opinion damage done her false keel, portion torn off, another part still hanging attached bottom. "We must take account wish bring up," observed Adair, "so may chance running ship rocks, want her go." The next hours anxious passed; for, although sea going wind moderate, water rushed leaks rate required ceaseless efforts crew keep under. The youngest midshipman board-- Tommy Pratt, hitherto unknown fame readers--was observed, one ship's boys, considered strong enough handle buckets, running two big jugs, emptied scuppers. "Every little helps, I have heard say," answered Tommy first lieutenant; "and I suppose quarts much would sink ship. So I got Ned Jones, nothing, lend hand; I calculate emptied two hundred gallons least, that is something, sir." "Well done, boy," answered lieutenant. "I will forget Ned. Who knows he kept last hundred gallons might sent her bottom?" Some time afterwards found still working away, though Tommy confessed "his arms aching considerably, he glad could stop leak." Men sharp eyes sent mast-head, look Virginia Island. It uncertain whether high rocky fertile island, little better sand-bank. Should first correctly laid down, master hoped might moment seen; prove low island, might become visible close upon it. Then came question, laid correctly? Adair, though he assured his crew ought night, quite satisfied point. Hitherto men laboured away bravely, weaker less spirited began show signs fatigue; instant relieved, threw deck though utterly incapable exertion. Some men, indeed, actually sank pumps, others took places, doctor went round exhausted ones, giving stimulants, urging fresh exertions. Several, however, came turn pump hand buckets, declared unable move. It important maintain discipline; time first lieutenant, went among them, unwilling use harsh measures. Suddenly he recollected Tommy Pratt. Taking one men, he showed young midshipman his companion still working away big water jugs, running nimble squirrels. "They work last eight hours, certain knowledge," said lieutenant. "Are you, big, strong man, ashamed yourself?" "Yes, I am," answer; and, rousing men, set work without grumbling. "I sure example youngsters would good," observed lieutenant Captain Adair. "Not baled several hundred gallons, gallant conduct many thousands probably pumped ship." As _Empress_ ran on, land seen, spirits began fall lower before. In latitude gales likely prevail often fine weather; another might spring ship could carried harbour, run shore necessary. Even Adair, who, since he ascertained correct position ship, his hopes revive, felt probable shore might never reached. The hours passing by. He Green consulted chart, decide spot ocean steer Virginia Island appear. They returned deck, look-out aloft shouted-- "Land! land!" "Where away?" inquired captain. "Just port bow." "Are sure land?" asked captain. "Certain, sir. I have seen last ten minutes; mist it, I could make clearly enough." The master second lieutenant immediately went aloft, took look glasses land. On coming reported doubt land considerable elevation, great extent, indented shores; hoped, therefore, harbour might found there. The ship's course accordingly slightly altered, she stood towards sail steam. In short time high, rocky island could seen rising blue ocean, sparkling rays setting sun. It several miles eastward spot marked chart. "If affords us shelter means repairing ship, must truly thankful," observed Adair. No murmurs heard. Even shown inclination skulk, laboured away might main. In hours safety might secured. The sun set. Although land time distinctly seen, yet considerable distance off. Adair determined run anchor lee land, await daylight, harbour might found. The crew time might given in, muscles even strongest ached; one laboured before. Tommy his companion worked away jugs, although poor little fellows almost dead beat. "Cheer up, Ned!" Tommy kept saying. "If keep water ship, shall see mothers sisters again; do not, shall not. So work away, boy, work away!" The lieutenant declared afterwards he believed boys would continued heaving water overboard sea got necks, ship going down. As _Empress_ approached island, sail shortened, her way stopped, lead might hove; soundings found. She therefore kept respectful distance, cautiously steering round lee side, lead constantly going, lest she might run reef water. The outline island could dimly seen rising high ocean clear sky. It looked barren forlorn enough. As Adair his officers, indeed could find time, eagerly watching it, light seen suddenly burst forth. It gradually increased, must large fire observed blazing height. "There inhabitants, events," exclaimed Adair first lieutenant. "There one, way," said latter, "or fire could lighted. Perhaps harbour, he expects serve beacon us." "He would scarcely suppose would venture without one board knows it, unless dangers way," answered captain. "Our safe plan bring outside, wait till daylight. We stand close can--a dozen fathoms, possible." The leadsmen stood chains either side, swinging leads high air hove them. The ship appeared already close bottom could found. Slowly she stood on. The first heave showed twenty fathoms, next fourteen, seemed ship directly cliffs. But experienced seamen knew darkness deceptive. "Let go!" shouted Adair, anchor ran out. The ship quickly brought up, Adair hoped that, she rest, water would run less rapidity, though would still necessary keep crew steadily pumping away. For first time several nights Adair turned in, desiring called event importance occur. When he awoke, he satisfaction hearing crew gained six inches leak, though, relaxation efforts, water would quickly flowed again. All hands anxiously waited daylight. The fires kept banked up, ready moment become necessary put steam. It fortunate precaution taken. It gone two bells second watch, sudden squall, descending cliffs, struck ship. The lead, second lieutenant, watch, ordered hove, showed she drifting. Adair deck moment. He ordered cable veered out. The third lieutenant, forecastle, reported anchor away. It accordingly hove up, found parted close shank, leaving flukes fast sand rock stuck. Steam immediately got up, although time ship drifted distance sea. When morning broke she surrounded thick mist, shutting every object half mile off. Still, direction land known, engines set work, she soon steamed back. "I afther thinkin'," said Pat, "that black rock saw last night Cape Fly-away, afther all. It wonder ever sight again. But, hurrah! there is fire saw burning, must human there; an' Cape Fly-away contains living sowl except, maybe, Flyin' Dutchman, afther he got tired cruising his ould craft, an' taken livin' shore." Similar ideas, although expressed different language, uttered many men. However, prevent pumping away before. All time, must remembered without moment's cessation whole crew thus engaged spell spell. "If that is Cape Fly-away, it is time fly far," observed Pat, land came sight anchor let go seven fathoms water, still closer shore, hoped would hold. The engineer, however, received orders keep fires up, she might hold her ordinary blast might strike her. As mist cleared away, every object shore could distinctly seen. The ship found quarter mile distant almost circular line cliffs, forming deep basin, opening towards sea. They rose many places height nearly 900 feet, extending either side curious basin mile. It thus conjectured island two miles length. That bar entrance harbour evident way water broke completely across it; but, size basin, would contained fleet ships large _Empress_. While looking shore, Dutch flag run end staff end high rock southern side entrance. "Sure, I thought so!" said Pat, he saw it. "That is Flyin' Dutchman. Before boats reach shore he an' his island again, an' lead us pretty chase!" "Maybe, Massa Pat," replied Peter, "if come calm, beat de steam. He hab always sail head wind; tink dat big rock play us dat trick." Before sending boats shore, Adair mustered hands. "Now, lads," he said, "I tell I think right acknowledge, although may guessed it, ship reach Aden Mauritius, land I know of; that, save lives, I propose running yonder harbour beaching her prevent her going down; but, remember, one thing I must have--that is, strict discipline obedience orders. You understand I severely punish man exhibits insubordination. It well say that, time, I know I trust you. You shown kept ship afloat long. You will, I know, work will, every man must necessary preservation lives. Return pumps get ship harbour, or, not, spot she sink lower." The crew gave three cheers, resumed labours. Adair immediately despatched two boats, first lieutenant master, sound entrance harbour communicate person persons lighted fire night hoisted flag morning. The master his boat led way, sounding he went, entrance nearly gained. Twelve feet found, shallowed eight, greatest depth bar. As boats got closer Green observed person end point, dressed conical goat-skin cap, jacket trousers material, watching closely waving vehemently. The master, performed first part his duty, steered direction towards stranger pointing. As boat touched beach he sprang out, instant afterwards, instead seeing stranger, his surprise delight find his hand grasped Gerald Desmond. "How, that is wonderful, come here?" exclaimed master. "We long given lost." "I afraid so," answered Desmond. "And, faith, I idea I lost, I have many long month, two companions escaped wreck Dutch ship brought thus far. But, tell me, _Stella_ escape uncle rest party board?" Green relieved Desmond's mind point, astonished little adding Captain Adair commanded ship outside. "And companions?" asked master. "An honest Dutch lad--Rip Van Winkle, I call him--who wrecked me, faithful dog Snarley. They set morning bring couple goats sacrificed entertainment. I saw coming last night, I suspected English man-of-war. You may, therefore, judge disappointment morning I found disappeared. Though I guessed truth, blown would steam back, sometimes horrible thought would occur ship gone down; but, case, I hoped boats would escaped come shore." Desmond expressed his great satisfaction receiving information his uncle Terence captain ship extraordinary manner driven refuge towards rock he wrecked. "We nearly met fate supposed, ship's bottom somewhat resembles sieve, must her destiny cannot manage get her bar high water. At events, must run her it, men well-nigh worn out, she cannot kept afloat many hours longer," added Green. "The sooner that is done better, then," answered Desmond, "for gale blow heavily, either shore, provisions stores saved, may quickly reduced starvation. Rip I found enough eat aid fishing-lines, ship's company over-abundant population small kingdom." "But I eager, Desmond, know reached said `small kingdom' yours," said Green. "I will tell pull off," answered Gerald, "though I anxious see uncle's honest face learn things gone home--whether claimant taken possession title estate. Poor fellow! he will not bless island, whatever do, afforded shelter, though may mighty long time I get back old Ireland disappoint delight heart old friend, Counsellor McMahon, fancying his toil trouble thrown away, his purse suffered little. I often wished I possessed means tranquillising his mind point." "From Captain Adair said, I do not think counsellor ever given idea safety," answered master, "but hear soon." This conversation took place boat returning ship, Desmond exchanged greetings first lieutenant. "Well," exclaimed Jos, "`it is ill wind blows nobody good,' although I am sorry enough lose ship, yet finding goes long way towards reconciling her fate, especially I pay her." Adair expressed somewhat similar language seeing his nephew, Saint Maur. "I sure would turn one day other, Gerald," he said, "and counsellor, I do not mind court-martial bother I shall go through, I found you. Although I anxious enough hear came here, I much listen you." Such, indeed, case. Before attempt could made carry ship bar, everything possible must got her. The boats immediately lowered loaded provisions canvas forming tents. All hands worked away will, young Lord Saint Maur turning much energy rest, officers men pulling hauling away ropes. To land stores rapidly, Adair directed carpenter construct several rafts, would serviceable long sea continued smooth, would untrustworthy come blow. Lord Saint Maur gave satisfactory intelligence he found three large boats island, apparently left party purpose catching whales, reason gone without time remove them. He considered could quickly repaired. He accordingly, accompanied carpenter's crew, returned shore, soon mid-day, he men sent assist brought off. They soon loaded way back shore. Not moment lost. The marines landed help unload boats carry cargoes spot selected proposed encampment right side entrance, level space size great distance water. Desmond's companion, Rip Van Winkle, had, mean time, brought couple goats, he killed prepared refreshment boats' crews. No one, however, time "fist" piece run back boat. Not became dark see entrance boats cease plying backwards forwards, even crew board engaged hoisting articles sorts hold, discharged daybreak. The night calm, every hope entertained next day large portion stores provisions might landed, well ammunition guns. A careful watch kept, greater portion officers crew turned obtain rest much needed. Those actually look-out engaged pumping before, although water ran less furiously first, would soon otherwise gained previous ascendancy. Strange men sleep soundly sinking ship, sinking she was, slowly though gradually, relaxation efforts necessary keep her afloat would proved doom. Several times night Captain Adair turned out, anxious sleep soundly. As morning approached, he feared, appearance sky, weather would change. His nephew, slept board, joined him. "I do not think need fear yet," he observed. "I have watched appearance weather ever since I landed, every day I look-out hopes seeing ship passing able attract her attention. Not long ago vessel hove sight, weather came bad, although she made attempt near rock, she driven again, I saw her." Captain Adair cheered Saint Maur's remarks. No sooner first streak dawn appeared sky, he roused hands, boats, hoisted up, lowered immediately loaded stores got ready previous night. The boats came shore, fast could load unload passed backwards forwards harbour ship. To save long pull, Captain Adair determined, Saint Maur's advice, carry her closer in. Steam got up, anchor hove bottom, she stood towards shore. As day advanced wind, hitherto coming land, shifted began blow much stronger before, white line surf formed across mouth harbour. The boats, however, continued pass it, although without risk swamped, crews occasion got jackets well wetted. No one thought danger inconvenience. Their great object land stores provisions sufficient last many weeks months, might be, stay there, well knew old ship must go bottom knocked pieces, unless run safely bar beached inside harbour. She still good store coals board. This sacked sent shore, small quantity remaining, little required carry ship bar. Night put end labours. Besides marines, several officers men landed. As previous night, part crew slept, rest worked pumps kept look-out. It gone one bell middle watch, Tommy Pratt knocked door captain's berth, hurried tone exclaimed, "The wind blowing hard; dead shore, sir. Mr Green says ship drifting towards land." Adair sprang deck. As he listened sound wild breakers watched masses foam appeared darkness leaping rocks, he saw ship drifting she must soon dashed wild coast her lee. He immediately ordered steam got up. Small amount coal left board, must employed get ship danger, she must carried safer anchorage, coal brought back shore. Some time elapsed, however, steam could got her. She riding wind her stern shore, instead of, before, her head it. Adair Saint Maur anxiously paced deck, watching rocks lee. Every instant wind increasing. The roar breakers sounded louder, masses foam could seen flying sheets rocks. At length engineer announced steam got up, engines put motion, cable slipped still sinking ship steamed away place could afford her refuge her last extremity. Still, sea breaking shore, she would certainty strike, probability many deck would washed away, she herself would exposed full force waves, ere long she would go pieces. Adair addressed crew, urging renewed exertions pumps. All day long she continued steam, her head wind, though still making little way. The captain saw importance waiting spring tides, when, lightened she was, he hoped she would get across bar. That day one great suspense. There much sea boats got out, bad weather continue, coal board would exhausted, she, perfectly helpless, would driven distance land, might unable regain sail. Saint Maur his best cheer his uncle. "I escaped many dangers, I thought hope gone, I cannot say I feel anxious do," he observed. "I remarked wind never blows long together one quarter. We may fine calm to-morrow." "I pray Heaven may," said Adair, melancholy tone he yet spoken in. However, his officers crew he kept cheerful aspect he done along. CHAPTER EIGHTEEN. LORD SAINT MAUR NARRATES HIS ADVENTURES--CARRIED OFF BY THE DUTCHMAN-- ILL-TREATED--DRUNKEN SKIPPER AND MATES--RIP VAN WINKLE AND SNARLEYOW-- SHIP STRIKE, ON A REEF--CREW DESERT HER--SAINT MAUR, RIP, AND SNARLEY GET INTO THE LONG-BOAT--SHIP GOES DOWN--REMAIN UNDER THE LEE OF THE REEF ALL NIGHT--MAKE SAIL IN THE MORNING--NO WATER--VIRGINIA ISLAND REACHED-- BOAT CAPSIZED ON THE BAR--SAINT MAUR AND RIP SAVED BY SNARLEY--THEIR LIFE ON THE ISLAND--WATER FOUND--GOAT'S FLESH--THE EMPRESS SEEN APPROACHING THE ISLAND--PREPARATIONS FOR CROSSING THE BAR--AWFUL SUSPENSE--SHIP STEAMS ON--STRIKES WITH A CRASH ON THE BAR--MORE STORES LANDED--THE JOLLIES ALARMED BY A JET OF STEAM--SAILS SEEN IN THE DISTANCE. "By-the-by, I never told I came playing Robinson Crusoe his man Friday yonder barren rock," observed Saint Maur, he his uncle paced together deck _Empress_. "You remember night I hooked yacht stranger ran us down, and, I thought, sent bottom. I leave judge state fear anxiety I left. From way fellows talked I got board, I discovered Dutchmen. I rushed aft skipper entreated heave lower his boats try pick might floating, he either understand would not. When I ran helm, intending put down, he might better comprehend meaning, he his mates held back. I pitched one fellow knocked over, treat way, skipper his big fist hit blow head brought deck. "When I came senses broad daylight, I knew long time, yacht gone down, must lost lives. I believe Dutchman intended apologise treated unceremonious fashion, but, I could understand word he said, I sure. He behaved, however, afterwards, far better I expected way acquaintance commenced. I never good hand picking languages, time I could make even imperfectly understood one board. Strange say, man among spoke word English. I wanted skipper put port, he replied that, `Out his course he would go man.' I begged him, chiefly signs, fall homeward-bound ship, put board her. He nodded his head let understand that, providing calm weather, he objection, advised meanwhile console his schiedam, he plentiful supply. Both he his mates indulged pretty largely, I found. I expected he would touch Cape, disgust he ran south'ard, order fall westerly trades, I found he intended touch nowhere he reached Batavia. "This anything consolatory, besides I one talk to, book board I could read. I tried hard make Dutch books he board, used ask mates, indeed men I found hand, pronounce words, I tried discover meaning. I believe, voyage lasted longer, I learned speak read Dutch fluently; but, skipper drunk half his time, mates two quarters, I could get much them. The fellow really use young Rip Van Winkle. He took liking me, I him, first, I often saved many cuff kick he will not receive crew. He was, I confess, sort `dirty Dick' board, he would continued I taught clean himself; he fond washing one, except weather cold, he rather objects it, falls back his bad habits. My companion besides Rip large dog--no great beauty--whom I called Snarleyow, unable pronounce his Dutch name, he took it, he me, immediately, always came called. I treated friend, whereas, skipper downwards, he accustomed receive kicks ha'pence, except poor Rip, consequently great affection his masters. "Besides anxiety you, disappointment able take advantage new position which, Counsellor McMahon, I placed--not weighed much me--I could help feeling anxious way ship navigated. Being unable understand Dutch books, I could work reckonings, though frequently I took observation, keep hand in. "I chance communicating England. We sighted British ship, time I picked enough Dutch use signal-book, I hoisted signals `British officer board; heave him.' I thought skipper saw ship heave he would same, blowing hard, he obstinately refused lift tack sheet lower boat, fancy I felt I saw homeward-bound vessel standing away us. From temperature weather I suspected got long way south, came blow hard. The Dutchman shortened sail, he generally wind, continued course he steering. The old ship, though tub, good sea boat, I reason fear danger, provided she run her stem iceberg strike rocks reefs. Blow high, blow low, skipper walked deck his hands his pockets huge meerschaum his mouth, looking composed usual? "One night I turning in, I felt ship strike. Of course I sprang deck, I followed skipper first mate, second mate watch. The crew singing lost. "`Do afraid, boys!' cried skipper, calling light his pipe, thrusting his hands his pockets. `She will drive it. Another hand helm. Keep standing!' "I knew, thickness his voice, he half seas over, he never exhibited his state way, except he sank table. Still, I hoped his composure he knew were, scrape clear sand-bank sea breaking fearful force. Several seas, indeed, nearly pooped us; surged forward, touching occasionally way threatened split ship fragments; she held together wonderfully. The men, however, hope I had; I saw gathering either side, near boats, taking falls hands, ready lower without orders. "Rip came me. `What is going happen, mynheer?' he asked. "`The ship probably go bottom get knocked pieces; may perhaps escape danger, last reach Batavia,' I answered. `Whatever happens, stick me, Rip, lend hand whenever I want it, I may perhaps save you.' "Scarcely, however, I spoken ship struck far greater force before, fore main masts going board, falling clear deck. Still she went on; carpenter sounded well, found water rushing rate precluded possibility keeping ship afloat. She gone edge reef, rose starboard bow, high water, broke force sea. Springing aft, I put helm, man deserted, she rounded lee rocks. "The crew instantly began lowering boats. The skipper his first mate tumbled one, several men shoved off; second mate took possession other, rest crew, leaving Rip still deck. So overcrowded they, I saw likely go down; I determined take chance ship, I thought, light cargo board, might possibly float long enough enable us build raft. The two boats quickly disappeared darkness, without provisions water, men hurry forgot take, skipper his first mate drunk think it. I bethought examining boat amidships, I feared might crushed falling mast; fortunately escaped. I told Rip cut lashings clear, reminding lives depended it--to see rope remained attached vessel's deck. I jumped in, followed Rip Snarley, left board us, whose instinct showed boat likely prove ark safety. The oars, well masts sails, stowed her, couple hen-coops, last surviving pig, variety articles. Rip heave pig overboard, I stopped him, told hunt plug-hole, he time stop bung, I saw water rushing deck. The ship go immediately; I suspect that, hands remained board, might kept her afloat daylight, events. "We got oars shove boat clear instant water rushed deck. I think I ever experienced anxious moment life. At last sea came sweeping along, round reef, lifted us clear, right bulwarks, free masts spars still hanging side. We pulled away lives, saw masts dragged ship went bottom. The mizzenmast remained last water. We pulled lee reef; but, anchor, compelled hold her her position paddling night. When morning broke, land sight; wind westward, I judged safest plan steer northward, might either fall ship, make Java, western coast Australia, sight island way. We small cask water boat, three empty casks, put way. My hope able fill rain water got northern latitude, likely meet ship. The reef lay ran half mile north south water; much I could judge line white foam extended far eye could reach. As place ship likely approach, sooner got latitude better. The wind moderated, accordingly made sail stood eastward. "We three days boat, small cask water gradually diminishing, drop rain fallen fill casks, sighted small island. Hoping might afford us shelter, events might obtain water, steered towards it. As approached saw harbour opening us. Though I thought would risk crossing bar, yet I determined make attempt. Anything better dying thirst. The water appearing smoother centre, I stood sail boat could carry towards it, still blowing fresh. The bar reached; I expected next instant smooth water, abominable roller came tumbling in, swamped boat, turned her over, washing Rip away. I clambered bottom, I saw Snarley, come surface. The dog, looked him, made towards point inside harbour, and, exerting his strength, hauled Rip up. I, meantime, tossing bar, expecting every moment washed off, I saw Snarley returning. Knowing I his help, I sprang swam towards him. I twisted fingers left hand his long, shaggy hair, he towed surf safely shore, I found Rip already recovered waiting me. He threw his arms around neck burst tears, exclaiming Dutch--`I thought gone, mynheer, I left alone; come shall manage live.' "He bestowed his caresses Snarley saved me. The sun bright warm, soon dried clothes; exist next question, eaten pig, doomed quickly die satisfy hunger. I fancy raw pork, although companions particular. Suddenly I bethought wreck I put tin box matches pocket light pipe. I felt it. It there; although water got in, I hoped sun would restore efficiency. I laid carefully rock, sat watch them, turning over, Rip set obtain fuel. Pieces driftwood strewed shore; some, high tide, thrown distance water, perfectly dry. Rip discovered also plenty moss branches low shrubs grew hollows level parts island. He soon sufficient supply good fire. I looked anxiously matches. I afraid strike one I certain thoroughly dry, I otherwise knocked end. I selected one middle box, appeared never wetted, getting sheltered place, I drew along side box. To great delight ignited immediately; leaving Rip blow fire, I replaced matches box, I stowed carefully away pocket. We knives, I got large one board cutting tobacco. We turned eyes poor piggy, grubbing near us, trying find roots. In moment Rip sprang upon him, he could give two grunts squeak he turned pork. "We stop singe him, quickly steaks toasting fire, Snarley looked wistfully on, giving hungry sniff every piggy's carcase. It somewhat lean, he short commons boat. "`Good dog, deserve food,' said Rip, giving Snarley certain portions I one inclination eat. "While meal saw cask wash shore. The pork excited thirst, Rip ran down, hoping find water it; empty. We looked about, trusting cask still remaining might sent us, nowhere seen. "`Patience,' I observed; `we may shower long, fill cask, bring safe.' The boat, I said, tumbling bar. At length driven inside harbour. Rip offered swim tow her in. I hesitated fear sharks, he declared latitude likely found. I begged wait she got nearer, she soon did, stripping his clothes, he boldly plunged in. "`You remain shore, mynheer,' he said; `you better able help come now. Should I get tired, I always rest bottom boat.' "When Snarley saw set off, he also plunged in. On reaching boat Rip put rope dog's mouth, taking another himself, began tow boat towards beach. It hard work, though wind partly favour, time sending boat towards foot cliffs opposite entrance, surf broke heavily, would soon knocked her pieces. When Rip got tired, he climbed up, he intended, bottom boat, resting seconds, took towing, Snarley time swimming bravely on. I never saw animal exhibit much sagacity. "At length boat brought near enough enable Rip wade, I going his assistance, dragged her she grounded. A slight examination showed us without tools never able repair her, whole one side crushed greatly damaged. We accordingly determined break her build hut fragments shelter us. By time, however, thirst became almost unbearable. "`Perhaps water may found hollows rocks,' observed Rip. "Snarley apparently suffering much were, he saw us moving away landing-place he ran ahead. "`He will find water, there is found,' said Rip; I hope. We climbed rocks, exertion reached top island, Snarley dashed forward, great joy saw his head hollow, evidently enjoying draught water. We ran on, nearly toppling noses eagerness made way rough ground. We soon following Snarley's example, pure pool water feet, two others close hand, dozen yards circumference. Although apparently filled rain water, spring, sufficient quantity supply wants. Even could possible exhaust them, would refilled fresh showers. "Having quenched thirst stood look around us, caught sight several animals great distance stopping gaze us. They goats, kids sides. Here food enough last us years come, though might difficulty catching ourselves. We felt Snarley would render us valuable aid matter, need fear starving. Refreshed, set take survey island. "As passed along cliffs overlooking harbour, caught sight little bay three boats, hauled beach, couple huts, human seen. We shouted; voices, however, might possibly reach spot. It evident, events, island time inhabited, distance could judge condition boats huts, might years before. As wished housed night, returned landing-place, discovering way, among grass, leaves tasted like spinach. I felt sure would serve vegetable diet, important obtain. The mast, yards, sails still attached boat. Though strength enough drag her entire, got hold put small tent, served shelter us night. We thankful even protection, sunset atmosphere became chilly. We pretty good spirits, thankful Heaven found means sustaining life. I thought probable, too, long vessel would appear take us off. Snarley, dried running about, crawled tent assisted keep us warm, first part night kept large fire blazing feet. We keep watch, island certainly contain savage inhabitants wild beasts, slept soundly sense perfect security. "Next morning, breakfasting pork sorrel leaves, ate raw, want means boiling them, set examine boats huts. It long walk round huts were; expected, found empty. The boats tolerable condition; though not, judged, used several months, still serviceable. Without tools, however, could repair even one sufficiently enable us continue voyage. While examining huts, discovered iron pot, likely prove greatest value us. Rip immediately set work scrape clean. On way back filled water. The rest day spent pulling pieces wreck boat, carrying spot selected habitation, preferred discovered near boats. "As soon finished pork, lasted us ten days more, set search kid, felt sure Snarley would help us catch. We disappointed, though poor mother fought bravely defence. As she stopped got up, captured her also, soon managed tame her sufficiently afford us milk. We spent time improving habitation, hunting goat wanted one, collecting sorrel, enabled us make tolerable broth. Salt got abundance crevices rocks, manufactured spoons drift-wood, wooden platters cups. We also brought materials huts improve own. I think you will say, see it, respectable abode couple bachelors. I often I longed loaf soft tack glass something stronger water. I managed keep Rip constantly employed. "While rummaging huts one early visits, he discovered corner bag containing palm sail needle, nearly dozen fishing-hooks articles. The hooks likely prove great value. We immediately twisted fishing-lines, taking piece goat's flesh bait, scrambled end rock, water deep, try luck. That day caught ten fine fish. We additional thankful, health required change diet. We longer slightest apprehension starving. Still months sort life, I began wish get away. We rigged flag-staff saw, hoisted Dutch flag, one found locker boat. "Day day I looked sail, none appeared, I began think I doomed spend remainder life desert spot. At last clothes wore out. To replace I prepared goat-skins, rigged strange costume Green discovered me. I often boy fancied would pleasant live island myself, one companion; faith! I found reality different, I would gladly given title estates escape. `It ill wind blows one good.' I assure heart leaped mouth I saw _Empress_ approaching, dreaming time dangerous condition she reduced. I own, however, I shall glad see her safe inside harbour." After hours, gale moderated, _Empress_ stood back mouth harbour, came anchor close Adair thought safe go. A boat came off, sufficient supply coal enable her cross bar. Adair began fear would impossible wait spring tide, leaks begun gain pumps spite efforts crew keep water under. The larger quantity water got ship, lower she would be, less able cross. As surf considerably gone down, boats employed morning night landing stores. But every time returned loaded bar, ran considerable risk swamped. Adair seated his cabin, day's work over, his nephew, carpenter desired speak him. "The men best, I done best; opinion duty express it: ship will not swim four twenty hours longer," said Mr Gimlet. "All hands ready work pumps buckets drop, water rushing faster pump out, come blow again, human power keep ship afloat." Adair offended freedom warrant officer spoke. "You hands done best, Mr Gimlet," he answered. "We must manage keep ship going to-night, to-morrow morning, top high tide, attempt take her bar. It question whether shall succeed, I loth lose her, risk must run." "No doubt that, sir," answered carpenter. "If she strikes bar, she will never get again, except piecemeal; that is better going bottom." Although, besides marines, good many men landed, sufficient number remained work pumps, watch watch, Adair Desmond set example labouring them, done. That night trying one, captain events, yet passed. To-morrow must decide fate ship, whether she would cast helpless wreck reef carried smooth water beached spot might possible repair her. Besides, her upper works strong sound, she evidently different character, like many another fine-looking craft. Morning came length. Adair urged Saint Maur go shore. "I do not hide crossing bar undertaking considerable danger--some, us, may lost," said captain. "I want return home assume title property, enjoy life many years, benefit peasantry estate good can. I getting life, best cannot expect enjoy many more." Nothing, however, captain could say would induce young lord quit ship. "I know bar well one. There exists channel, though narrow one, I think I take her," he answered. Adair last consented; preparations made crossing dangerous spot. Adair ordered men take breakfast, went stations. The whole crew deck except engineers, course remain attending engines. There time lost, already water hold risen higher ever done before. Steam got up. The engineer reported ready below. Two best hands sent wheel. The crew stood forward, aft, officers stationed. Desmond took his post side captain, whence he could direct helmsmen. All board felt awful time. Some said ship, moment she touched ground, would go pieces, sea breaking her would wash hands her decks. Desmond, however, assured captain he fear; even ship cross bar, she would run far enough escape full force breakers, besides which, present moderate, likely injure her materially. The anchor hove up, fore-topsail set assist steering her, she headed towards mouth harbour. Onwards she seemed fly towards it. Many even stoutest held breath. The boats waiting inside harbour's mouth, render assistance necessary. To stranger shore watching approaching ship, she appeared trim stout man-of-war need be. Nothing deck gave indication her rotten condition below. Pat Casey Peter standing together. "Shall get an' put ould boat rights, shall stick bar an' see her knocked pieces?" asked Pat his companion. "Me tink, Massa Pat, dat de ship stick de rocks go pieces, dat better dat dan hands get drowned, den get 'shore break up." Similar remarks exchanged amongst men generally. "Silence, fore aft!" sang captain, harbour's mouth approached. All board turned eyes towards white line foam stretched across it. Desmond pointed helmsmen exact spot steer. He give another order; one spoke. The smooth water could seen inside. Would ship ever float it? Full steam put on. Forward she glided like arrow towards mark. Already outer barrier reached water broke, hissing foaming either side. Onward she plunged; came crash, her masts quivered, knew noble ship devoted destruction. A roller came sweeping astern. It lifted her. Again she moved forward, strike greater force before. Once she floated buoyant water, descend crash heard felt stem stern, telling rocks gone her bottom. There she remained firmly fixed, her engines continuing work rapidly rising water rushing in, put fires. The engineer, thoughtfully turned steam prevent boilers exploding, his duty done, appeared deck announce captain engines stopped. "I see have," said Adair, smiling, even moment sad captain seen his ship wrecked. The vessel evidently immovable, even rollers come sufficient force lift her, she must sunk immediately deep water. Crash succeeded crash, rocks burst her planks, cheek blanched, eye quailed, cry heard, man deserted his station. The rollers continued tumble in, breaking close her stem, failed wash her. Adair stood earnestly watching would next take place. At last he satisfied lives committed his charge safe. "My lads," he exclaimed, "our brave ship never float ocean; still form her crew, whether board shore, I sure exhibit good discipline hitherto maintained. We turn get her. We may discovered taken weeks, may remain months here. As must prepared latter alternative, must husband provisions stores. I hear harbour full fish, goats island, and, consequence, water found, need fear starving. The rest depends upon yourselves. We may happy ship's company make best everything, may become contrary grumble discontented. I do not expect you, I am sure shall work look things bright side." The crew gave three hearty cheers, Adair directing first lieutenant summon boats alongside, hands turned loading numberless articles still remained board. The valuable things already got out. By doctor's advice four main-deck tanks landed, smith's forge apparatus pertaining his trade, engineers might manufacture machine turning salt water fresh. The sails ropes also sent shore, indeed every article likely prove service ship contained. The captain Desmond, several principal officers, still remained board, careful watch kept night give due notice change weather threaten make advisable quit ship. Fortunately weather continued fine wind mostly blew land, boats able ply backwards forwards day long. One assistant-surgeons, lately come sea, declared he believed possible ship could contained multitudinous articles he saw landed; he idea could stowed away. In latitude winter likely prove severe, approaching, important land stores provisions, house party comfortably. For latter purpose, Adair went shore first time laid plan town. It formed one long street, blocks either side, cross road ran right angles main one. One block formed barracks marines, another hospital. The captain's house top street, opposite one lieutenants, another rest ward-room officers, third side way midshipmen. Then came rows huts, eight side, seamen. Another put petty officers, stokers one themselves, officers' servants one. At top street, could seen bottom, officers' mess tent, flags flying it, tasty-looking affair was. The walls partly composed stone, partly turf, roofed canvas. The roof Captain Adair's house also lined canvas, walls, divided partitions. Some midshipmen expressed regret ladies among them. "The ladies much obliged you," observed Charley Roy, joined _Empress_, senior mate board. "I suspect would rather remain comfortably shore. Perhaps you would like grand piano, ball-room, croquet lawn?" One building called grand hotel, frequented ranks, warrant officers sergeant marines stokers ship's boys. Liquor small quantities well watered could obtained there, could tea coffee, various beverages, ginger beer, doctor continued manufacture certain ingredients his possession, highly appreciated hot weather. The sergeant marines temperance man, persuaded half his corps fully third blue-jackets sign pledge, which, means breaking, faithfully kept. Thus man ever got drunk, many found could get well without liquor could it, became steady, sober men. The officers best keep men employed, amuse variety ways. No grumbling heard ranks. One fellow showed signs insubordination. He long known board "Grumpy Dick." No sooner he set his foot shore he asserted he free man, would longer work. "Very well, fine fellow," said captain. "If hands side you, officers I shall ought keep alive. But not, shall surely taste cat stout ship lies rocks. Sleep upon it, let know think to-morrow morning." Grumpy Dick, obstinate pig going market, mood next morning, captain ordered triced receive dozen hands boatswain's mate. This example good effect; men inclined follow it, thought better matter, time forward worked away well board. They plenty building houses. When men otherwise employed, engaged pulling materials old huts, bringing round strengthen new. They fond boasting size town, Pat Casey averred quite large enough send member Parliament, offering first representative Liberal principles. Then water brought supply town ponds Desmond Rip discovered top hill. It work mainly accomplished means piping various descriptions. Some lead, another part canvas, another portion wood form trough. It could turned top required. The apparatus turning salt water fresh also supplied water required; but, account fuel consumed, used dry weather risk ponds becoming empty. As soon town finished, Adair flag-staff erected fully rigged, way Desmond, one assistant, unable accomplish. A couple men midshipman stationed spy-glasses, watch horizon, hoist flag directly ship seen, hut built accommodation. A small six-pounder, used board signalising, also hauled fired case stranger coming near enough heard. A pile wood also collected order beacon fire kindled night, rockets blue-lights kept ready letting ship appear offing. A hag fish-hooks lines found board, party every day told fish, never failed return abundant supply. "Our friend `Blueblazes' would perfectly happy here," said Desmond, laughing, he captain sat wardroom mess table, daily dined. They especial fine fish dinner day--indeed, never time short commons. Of articles luxury, well meat biscuit, must, kept many months, ultimately come end, small allowance course served out. To keep good feeling, dinner-parties given one mess another. The first lieutenant invited warrant officers engineers, ranked them, one occasion, midshipmen invited another. Some seamen occasionally dined marines, _vice versa_. Then games; though ground cricket, quoits could played, course fiddler board, hornpipes danced. On Sunday work done first week two, chaplain service regularly twice day, occasionally also days week became settled island. Adair Desmond walking short distance town one afternoon, men's dinner hour, when, came sight marines' barracks, were, described, short distance high street, heard slight explosion, jet white vapour ascended roof huts, instant "jollies" seen rushing out, shouting English, Scotch, Irish, Yorkshire, South country dialects, tumbling other, sprawling ground, many without caps jackets, making way town, others harbour, others scrambling away hill. "What is matter, man?" asked Adair, soon he got one them, happened Irishman, stop. "Arrah! honour, captain dear, we are blown entirely. Sure must big fire engine sort barracks, would roasted boiled, night an' beds." The column steam, Adair saw smoke, continued ascend. "There must volcanic agency work," observed Desmond; "and I surprised fellows frightened burst suddenly midst." "We will examine it, events," said Adair. "If there is vent-hole, I do not suppose need apprehend danger." "Do not go near it, cap'n, may go again," exclaimed Irishman, he saw Adair Desmond making way huts. Several men, recognised captain, shouted companions stop, greater number came back, forming circle round spot, ashamed probably sudden flight. On examining place, Adair found directly men's table stood, jet steam burst forth upset it, must fallen small force men seated one side. Two poor fellows still table. At first Adair feared killed, appeared stunned frightened unconsciousness, way injured, table saved scalded. The orifice nearly foot diameter, apparently increasing, fresh columns steam, issuing it, ascended high air, blown canvas roof hut. The captain Desmond summoned men within hail, ordering carry injured comrades hospital, surgeons, come hearing noise, examined them. The whole population time turned out, various surmises might occur. One thing certain, island volcanic. What might ultimately happen impossible say. The "croakers" feared commencement disasters, moment town might blown air, whole island itself, could tell. Adair his officers endeavoured quiet alarm. The "jollies," recovered fright, ready pull barracks rebuild short distance vent-hole, surgeon assuring would better shipmates winter season, warm ground feet. As hands turned to, huts shifted another spot, little former site, evening work completed. Two days afterwards, however, rocking motion felt, accompanied low, rumbling sound, immediately afterwards two fresh jets steam burst forth. Day day rumblings heard, wandered distance town brought word seen, jets steam, smoke fire, certain rocks, remarked rising water, disappeared, others, different places, come surface. Although Adair believe violent convulsion would take place, he naturally became anxious escape rock. Any spot neighbourhood active volcano pleasant place live in. Still disagreeable officers ship's company hapless _Empress_ feel find side mountain might moment overturned sink ocean, without possibility making escape. As, however, Adair saw prospect averting evil, overtake them, he endeavoured keep his spirits his people persuading event feared highly improbable. After time men got accustomed appearance jets steam, "jollies" even made use putting pots boil fish. At length public mind became perfectly tranquillised, things went much before. Still captain could help feeling possible fresh outbreak might occur, he found surgeon first lieutenant opinion. A sharp look-out course kept passing sail. The royals two ships seen, signal-gun probably heard; could flag sighted. The time spent rock was, meanwhile, altogether uneventful. Week week, however, passed by, many time perfectly reconciled lot; others, especially officers, began grow weary life leading, longed get away. Trips also taken ship every day, long anything remained board get her. CHAPTER NINETEEN. CAPTAIN ADAIR'S LAST VISIT TO THE EMPRESS--RESOLVES TO BUILD A VESSEL OUT OF THE WRECK--THE DOCTOR FEARS THAT THE ISLAND MAY BE BLOWN UP--A HURRICANE--THE BOATS GET ADRIFT--THE SEA WASHES UP THE BEACH--A FLASH OF LIGHTNING REVEALS THE SHIP PARTING AMIDSHIPS--THE MASTS FALL--THE SHIP BREAKS UP--AN EARTHQUAKE--ROCKS FAIL FROM THE CLIFFS--RAFTS CONSTRUCTED--THE BOATS LAUNCHED--A STILL MORE FEARFUL CONVULSION THAN BEFORE OCCURS--THE CREW EMBARK ON THE RAFTS AND IN THE BOATS--ROY LEFT ON THE CLIFF--SAINT MAUR RETURNS TO CALL HIM--A FEARFUL RUSH FOR THEIR LIVES--REACH THE GIG IN TIME--THE ISLAND IN A TERRIFIC STATE OF COMMOTION--A SAIL IN SIGHT--APPROACHES THE ISLAND--PROVES TO BE THE BELLONA--ALL SAFE ON BOARD--TOUCHES AT THE CAPE--THE LAST OF MAJOR BUBSBY--ARRIVAL AT HOME--HAPPY MEETINGS--CONCLUSION. Adair Desmond paid visit _Empress_ one bright morning, harbour smooth mill pond, scarcely ripple even seen expanse ocean outside. She lay firm ever, her masts standing, appearance good condition she day attempt made bring her harbour, except looked could see clear water washing her. At distance she might supposed anchor. "I thinking vessel come near us since here, might wait months, perhaps years more, unless make attempt get means disposal," observed Adair. "What, would try cross Indian Ocean boats, would you?" asked Saint Maur. "No; I would thus risk lives people, must endeavour build craft wreck large enough get far Batavia, even Madras Calcutta," answered Adair. "I hopes first came shore ship would shortly appear, I decided building vessel. I determined delay longer. When return I draw plan carrying intention effect." Adair took several turns along deck. "This third ship I lost, I suppose I shall never get another," he said, sigh. "I shall looked upon unlucky man, though neither case could I blame myself, could one blame me. We go shore." He stepped accommodation ladder, still remained side. Some time spent consulting carpenter making arrangements pulling old ship pieces. Next morning hands begin work. It likely prove long undertaking, one sailor likes engaged in. It also doubtful weather would continue fine enough enable completed. During day slight movement earth felt, rumbling noise sounded beneath feet, another jet steam burst forth orifice distance town. But ship's company become accustomed sight spouts, trouble matter. In evening, Adair Desmond seated together, doctor called upon them. "I come, Captain Adair, state I made anxious days past various phenomena I observed island. I cannot help fearing internal commotion taking place beneath feet, may produce serious consequences. The orifices steam observed makes escape may prove safety valves, larger quantity steam engendered let off?" "You mean say, doctor, fear island may blown up, shall blown it?" said Adair, laughing, though he feel altogether comfortable his mind subject. "Such, captain, I apprehend may case, whether shortly time hence I cannot take upon say," observed doctor. "I would urge vessel built embark, I like leave human run risk destroyed, would case convulsion I dread take place." "That is thing fast possible," said Adair. "Do not, however, let men know think may possibly occur, officers either. The carpenter considers take us two months least break ship build new craft materials, hope land remain quiet task accomplished. Lord Saint Maur I accompany inspect new vent-hole phenomena speak of; although would pit scientific knowledge yours, yet perhaps may make discovery may allay apprehensions." They set once, still sufficient daylight enable reach spot doctor alluded. Adair, making considerable circuit, discovered several spots hot could scarcely touch hands, thought possibly doctor might correct. All he could do, however, make arrangements afford chance escape portion his people, island overwhelmed. He resolved boats fitted sea stores, water, provisions. The whole community turned night exception sentries, told keep watch according man-of-war fashion, although enemy likely attack them, roused well-known sound furious gale blowing shore. It came suddenly clap thunder, ere long breakers could heard roaring dashed rocky coast. Already wind lashed surface harbour foam, water rushed beach, threatening carry boats, largest moored short distance off, others hauled sand. The captain officers first aroused sound gale. They hurried out, turned hands secure boats. This easy matter, two already broken adrift, necessary risks go them. They, however, brought back full fury hurricane burst island. They length hauled beach means rollers placed strength fifty hands least applied each. The sea continued rise, became necessary drag still danger washed away. Even harbour enormous waves washed right huts, threatening destroy whole lower part town, inmates compelled carry goods chattels higher rock. The largest boats still remained beach, men, headed captain, accompanied several officers, attempting drag her up, loud sound, like report heavy gun, heard. "There goes old ship!" cried several voices. Adair feared remark true. Scarcely words uttered, flash lightning revealed ship parting asunder amidships. The mizzenmast fell time, mainmast seen still standing. In another minute came mainmast crash, followed shortly afterwards foremast bowsprit, and, high roar surf howling wind, rending crashing ship's timbers could distinguished. "There goes chance able build craft," observed Saint Maur captain. "The fragments come shore battered crushed use." "I fear so, indeed," answered Adair; "but must show men disheartened." The gale went increasing, sad sounds ship breaking continued, huge fragments cast force waves beach, several striking stern large boat, almost staving her she could hauled danger. Though men could more, stood watching catastrophe which, though many long expected it, come last suddenly upon them. As thus stood grouped together felt earth rock beneath feet way never done before. Then came sound far louder yet heard. Several men cried island blowing up. At moment fearful crash, light another flash lightning glimpse caught huge mass rock descending summit hill water. Another another followed. Adair Saint Maur remembered doctor's prognostications, began truly fear whole island breaking up, ere long might present mass broken fragments sink bodily beneath sea. They endeavoured, notwithstanding, maintain composure restore confidence men, many greatly alarmed. "Whatever becomes high cliffs seem crumbling away, I consider we, level spot, every chance escaping," exclaimed Adair. "We must, however, keep way rocks, which, tired existence sky, going find like bottom sea." By time night nearly over, morning dawned Adair looked out, particle ship remained entire except her engines, which, like huge creature, could distinguished, surrounded masses foam breaking bar, surface harbour outside along coast could seen fragments wreck every size, tossed waves. Adair heaved deeper sigh he ever done his life. The storm still continued rage fiercely first, impossible secure portions wreck except washed ashore harbour, even service danger, tossed about, threatening crush approached them. Still Adair thought might possible save wood sufficient building vessel. It would, events, give men something keep spirits prospect getting off. The carpenter shook his head he spoke subject. "I afraid, sir, rum sort craft build, permit say so, I think lengthen boats rise upon two three feet, produce better style craft likely put together." Adair thought matter over, discussed Saint Maur. They agreed possible, that, fearful convulsion island take place, would well boats thus fitted, order lives, events, might preserved. "We hope ship come sight land sinks bottom sea," said Saint Maur, cheerful tone. The captain remembered men foot morning without breakfast. "Pipe breakfast, Mr Smalls," he sang boatswain, near. The shrill pipe boatswain heard sounding roaring breakers, howling wind, crash falling rocks, still, though smaller pieces before, came toppling summit cliff seething waters harbour. The men willingly obeyed call, quickly seated mess tables, talking laughing away usual. Adair Saint Maur returned cottage. The roofs huts securely fastened blown away, hands soon beneath shelter. All day long gale raged. In spite it, carpenter, hands he required, set work preparing wood obtained enlarging boats. The largest had, must remembered, left influence sea, fancied she free danger. In morning, usual, party sent flag-staff, visible town. Some hours passed relief proceeding take place, observed coming cliffs, holding rocks slowly made way. "What happened?" asked Charley Roy, commanded second party. "The flag-staff gone well-nigh carried it," answer. "There ship sight; were, she would take good care come near rock she could help it, use going running chance losing lives." "You quite right," said Roy, he returned obtain orders. Adair, course, told go hill, adding, "We must get another flag-staff ready set soon gale over," he issued orders carpenter prepare it. When night closed appearance cessation gale; indeed, anything, matters looked worse done day. At usual hour hands turned obtain rest required, men watch stowed away sheltered corners could find, human even four hours could stood exposed pitiless tempest. It midnight nearest water aroused crashing sound, time dress themselves, found sea washing right huts, far higher done day before. Adair, slept lightly, also awakened voices shouts men rushed clothes bags mess things huts. He Saint Maur hurried ascertain matter, looking towards beach large boat left, hopes safety depended, she nowhere seen. A mass timber shattered fragments, surrounded seething water, alone marked spot. A portion wreck, evident, driven her, retiring sea carried her knocked pieces. The remainder night spent shifting huts exposed waves safer spot. Adair allowed word complaint escape him, he could dread might next happen. Towards morning gale abated, men employed hauling fragments spars floated among rocks. Some good size, others broken small pieces, could use saw planks. With large ones carpenter contrived, course couple days, build fresh mast supply place old one. By time weather calm, Adair Saint Maur several officers accompanied party selected set up. They carried telescopes, hoping hope ship might appear. But sail seen horizon, wreath smoke indicate passing steamer. The flag-staff erected, ensign run up, gun fired honour. But must hasten account adventures captain crew unfortunate _Empress_. Day day, week week went by. Occasionally earth trembled shook, jets vapour gas burst forth, orifices first appeared stopped up. The surgeon's face grew longer longer. "Well, doctor," said Adair, latter paying visit, "we blown yet, I hope old rock stand firm enough long left it, unless spend lives here." "That is reason fearful event day occur, captain," answered Dr McQuae. "I last night heard worse rumblings yet occurred. My bunk moved curious fashion." "You must dreaming," said Adair. "I slept lightly, heard noises I feel slightest movement earth." "Pardon me, Captain Adair. I broad awake time, could mistaken." Adair, making inquiries, surprised find several persons heard noises felt movement, especially sergeant marines, averred he nearly thrown his bunk. His statement, however, somewhat discredited warrant officers, expressed belief he addicted romancing. Be may, uncomfortable feeling prevailed among officers men, wishing away treacherous locality. A days commotion took place throughout length breadth island, left matter longer doubt. Vast fragments rock came tumbling summits cliffs, sending huge waves rolling beach, although sky serene wind blew gently northward, surf broke along mouth harbour. "If continues much longer must launch boats build rafts sufficient carry people, give us chance lives, events," observed Adair Saint Maur. "Cheer up, Uncle Terence," exclaimed Desmond; "the cliffs may tumble down, still, remarked before, may firm ground stand upon." "I do not know I done without you," answered Adair. "Frankly, I believe I broken altogether: For poor Lucy's sake I anxious escape, I honour, man, desert people one remains danger I must not." "At events, harm getting rafts built," said Desmond. "I direct first lieutenant set people work once, matter precaution, alarm them," answered Adair. There few, however, feel anxious captain get rafts completed, hands set work collect every particle timber could find along coast, haul bay. The carpenter, upon calculation, found he could form six rafts, thirty feet long twenty wide. These would carry crew able find room boats, provided sea tolerably smooth. A couple rafts completed, many hands could employed working away others, ominous sound alarmed heard, whole island seemed convulsed, rent asunder. Although movement ceased, made work away almost frantic haste. By means hand-spikes rollers, rafts, finished, launched, boatswain his mates commenced rigging best fashion could, sail-makers employed cutting canvas, kept store, rest being, taken roofs huts. Although much cliff fallen half fill harbour, point flag-staff stood remained intact. Charley Roy stationed party men, kept look-out around horizon sunrise sunset. They relieved night another party third lieutenant, directed burn blue-lights let rockets intervals, case ship passing. Night brought cessation toils crew. Torches formed, fresh hands laboured away rafts. Several times thus toiling, ground shook less violently. "Stop bit, an' we will afther gittin' you," cried Pat Casey, always ready joke cheer his companions. "Jist keep quiet, darlin', hours longer, an' an' part company, whin ye trimble much ye like." Whether volcano would accede his request seemed doubtful. Towards morning commotions increased, crash succeeded crash, could perceive portions cliff given way, fear rafts would swamped sea falling masses created, could get harbour. Strange say, spite fearful danger placed, men joked much ever, though worked away manner showed fully conscious necessity speed, officers labouring hard one. At sound boatswain's call scampered breakfast, bolted minutes, soon came back work. The weather became finer since landed island many months before. The sky clear air pure, invalid among them. The sixth raft completed, men working water, rumbling sound far louder thunder heard. The tall cliffs appeared fall fill whole harbour, mouth evidently ancient crater. The rocks seen lift heave; Adair stood shore, superintending launching raft, apparently cool unmoved ever. "Now, lads, get boats water," he exclaimed. "Let proper crews attend them; rest assist marines bringing provisions water." It said that, direction pay-master his assistants, casks filled water, provisions done packages, could easily transported. Even moment perfect discipline prevailed; men hurried backwards forwards, true, fast legs could carry them. They worked like colony ants, knowing exactly do. The midshipmen ordered boats respective crews stow packages, keep rafts beach. These next loaded, boats filled, men ordered take places rafts. Captain Adair Lord Saint Maur stood alone shore, sound gun heard. "I forgot Roy men him," exclaimed Adair. "I will go him," cried Desmond, he could stopped, he darted off. Adair ordered boats take rafts tow, proceed bar, would impossible find favourable opportunity crossing it. One boat--his gig--with four hands her, remained, she able carry, addition, Roy his party. Again sound gun heard, followed third report. All time cliffs end harbour appeared crumbling away, ground marines' huts stood, well beyond them, heaving visible undulations. Adair felt moment whole island might convulsed way destroy remaining it. He anxiously looked return Saint Maur Roy. The movements increased violence. He saw men boat turning eyes towards cliff, eager away, fearing lest would involved expected destruction island. He drew his breath freely length he saw Saint Maur appear top path leading hill, followed Roy his men. Down rushed headlong speed. They moment lose; already huge rents appeared ground, width across seemed scarcely possible could leap, rocks either side tumbling leaping along, threatening crush party made downward way. Adair ordered men gig come in, he stood half water holding her stem. He need hurry Saint Maur rest. One poor fellow struck, his companions wait him; saw glance he killed. Another narrowly escaped, huge block came near Saint Maur he sprang wide gap. With frantic haste dashed along, almost breathless reached beach. "Spring in!" cried Adair; "I shall last leave shore!" Roy men followed. Adair jumped board, made his way stern sheets. The bow-men shoved, without waiting orders, bending oars gig soon across bar. Saint Maur Roy much breath speak. Indeed, Adair forgot ask reason signals heard; as, steering bar, casting momentary glance his shoulders, he saw whole island rocking fro, steam smoke, flames bursting forth several fissures. Even neither he his men safety: island sink, rafts boats would drawn vortex; blow up, seemed likely, fragments would probably fall crush them, create violent commotion ocean would scarcely escape overwhelmed. Steering heaviest raft, he joined another boat towing her. As yet lee island, sails use. Long paddles formed use men rafts, worked energetically, boats, heavily laden were, unable make much headway. Roy, hitherto panting much speak, recovering himself, exclaimed-- "A sail, sir! sail! We saw her standing towards island. She is steamer, I think, though I could make her funnel. I caught sight wreath white smoke hanging her masthead." "Too probably she is passing," said Adair. "No, sir, she standing steadily way; heads her courses already risen horizon. We left flag flying, hill does not come toppling down, she see that, know one rock. Perhaps she coming expressly look us." "Thank Heaven!" cried Adair, voice choking emotion, first time calm composure he hitherto exhibited giving way. "My poor people saved!" The joyful news soon spread boat boat raft raft. At length feeling wind, sail set, little squadron steered course close possible, near ship, get island. As soon gained Adair considered safe distance, he ordered first lieutenant, one boats, cast stand towards stranger, whose topsails time could seen. He earnestly pray weather would continue calm board. Meantime he cast many anxious glance towards land, seemed, distance it, rest, though rumbling sounds reached thick clouds smoke flame ascending, showed good reason thankful escaped it. The first lieutenant's boat eagerly watched she glided rapidly smooth water. At last her white speck canvas disappeared beneath horizon, period elapsed. The stranger pronounced cut her canvas British man-of-war. At last she seen change her course, stand directly rafts. Soon afterwards glorious ensign England blew her peak. The sight welcomed cheer whole crew. There could doubt first lieutenant got board. On she came she approached, her canvas reduced. "Hurrah! she is _Bellona_!" exclaimed Saint Maur Adair moment. They knew her, another minute recognised Captain Rogers several old friends. Adair Desmond, springing side, heartily welcomed. "We come expressly look you," said Jack, he grasped hands, he told information he received master Australian trader. The _Bellona's_ boats lowered approached take crew rafts, well provisions water. "We arrived nick time," said Jack; "but island seems tolerably quiet, may well remove stores, men's bags, things, pity lose, I shall glad leave boats cannot take away." The _Bellona_ accordingly steamed towards entrance harbour, keeping, may supposed, safe distance case sudden outbreak. By time smoke flames disappeared, boats pulled in, piloted Adair his officers. The blue-jackets highly delighted recovering bags, marines kits, necessity left behind. The boats Saint Maur Rip found landed hauled high beach covered canvas protect weather. The valuable stores carried off, though provisions articles left might afford assistance sufferers ship might wrecked island. The _Bellona_ steered directly Cape, short time, wind became fair, making sail. That night watch deck declared saw bright glare sky rock low rumbling noise heard coming direction. Whether Virginia Island blown remained matter doubt, Captain Rogers think two ships' companies board his duty return ascertain fact. Crowded were, officers men happy could circumstances, wonderful yarns crew _Empress_ spin, none facts occurred losing narration, besides many describe chronicled history. The _Bellona_, immediately her arrival Simon's Bay, ordered home, Captain Adair his officers would have, course, undergo usual court-martial loss _Empress_. Scarcely she dropped her anchor, when, one first boats came off, seen stout military man, accompanied two ladies. Shortly after, Major Bubsby two Misses Bubsby ascended side. Jack, never wanting politeness, whatever his feelings, stood ready receive them. "My dear Captain Rogers," exclaimed major, grasping hand, "I telegraph station made number, I immediately hurried welcome you, picking Eugenia Angelica way. Will favour?" "What it?" inquired Jack. "Yes, favour; I acknowledge favour grant it. Will convey Mrs Bubsby two dear daughters England? You must know I compelled resign command, I find stay pleasant I wish." Billy Blueblazes, standing behind captain, observed Miss Angelica casting loving glances towards him. "Heaven forbid captain grant major's request," he said himself. He need fear score. Jack politely possible declined, even invite major Misses Bubsby below. "You must understand, Major Bubsby, I officers part ship's company _Empress_ carry home, inch spare. I cannot turn berths I offer, daughters would like sling hammocks lower deck." "I expect you, Captain Rogers," said major, angry frown gathering his brow. "Hard-hearted man!" murmured Miss Angelica. But Jack deaf could say, felt much inclined order master-at-arms escort his visitors, _nolens volens_, side. They last made virtue necessity, returned boat. Billy heaved sigh relief he watched pulling towards shore. It last he his captain ever saw heard Major Bubsby his daughters, major's name disappearing soon afterwards army list. Lord Saint Maur, course, went home _Bellona_. He accompanied Rip Snarley, former begging he might enter his service valet. Old England reached last, Captain Rogers made pleasing discovery he become admiral seniority. In short time, telegrams conveyed joyful intelligence arrival ship Captain Adair Lord Saint Maur board, Julia Lucy, former accompanied her fair daughters, arrived Southsea, often witnessed grievous partings happy meetings. This, may supposed, one happiest. Captain Adair honourably acquitted loss _Empress_. Though he obtain ship, he accompanied expedition Coomassie, took active part exploit redounded greatly honour troops, blue-jackets, marines engaged it, well noble leader, proving stern discipline courage effect, even pestiferous climates hosts brave foes. Lord Saint Maur, shortly his return home, married Miss Lucy Rogers, Archie Gordon became husband another Jack's daughters. Tom supposed confirmed bachelor, notwithstanding his early susceptibilities female attractions, until, going pay visit his old shipmate Kilcullin Castle, he met Misses McMahon, youngest he married. Billy Blueblazes, came act part his best man, fell head ears love eldest--not first Englishman similar circumstances captivated one Erin's fair daughters, she, discovering attractions satisfied her, counsellor ascertaining he heir good estate, objections raised, Billy became happy benedict, quitting service retired commander. Tim Nolan Pat Casey made appearance castle one day, "just," said, "to see his lordship getting on." "What going yourselves, good fellows?" asked Lord Saint Maur. They twirled hats scraped feet acknowledged quite settled, except made minds go sea again. On Lord Saint Maur offered cottages rent free, employment board his yacht summer, charge his boats river ran his estate. Jerry Bird obtained pension settled near Admiral Rogers, Peter became butler Billy Blueblazes. Indeed, satisfactory account given friends played part history. Soon his return Africa Captain Adair obtained his flag, "Three Admirals" remain, youth whole career, firmest friends, and, though shelved, take warmest interest glorious service spent lives, welfare younger relatives former followers.
