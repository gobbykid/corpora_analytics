 THE CHILDREN OF THE NEW FOREST. CHAPTER I. The circumstances I relate juvenile readers took place year 1647. By referring history England, date, find King Charles First, Commons England rebelled, civil war nearly five years, defeated, confined prisoner Hampton Court. The Cavaliers, party fought King Charles, dispersed Parliamentary army command Cromwell beginning control Commons. It month November year King Charles, accompanied Sir John Berkely, Ashburnham, Legg, made his escape Hampton Court, rode fast horses could carry toward part Hampshire led New Forest. The king expected his friends provided vessel he might escape France, he disappointed. There vessel ready, riding time along shore, he resolved go Titchfield, seat belonging Earl Southampton. After long consultation attended him, he yielded advice, was, trust Colonel Hammond, governor Isle Wight Parliament, supposed friendly king. Whatever might feelings commiseration Colonel Hammond toward king unfortunately situated, he firm his duties toward his employers, consequence King Charles found prisoner Carisbrook Castle. But must leave king retrace history commencement civil war. A short distance town Lymington, far Titchfield, king took shelter, side Southampton Water, south New Forest, adjoins, property called Arnwood, belonged Cavalier name Beverley. It time property considerable value, extensive, park ornamented valuable timber; abutted New Forest, might supposed continuation it. This Colonel Beverley, must call him, he rose rank king's army, valued friend companion Prince Rupert, commanded several troops cavalry. He ever his side brilliant charges made gallant prince, last fell his arms battle Naseby. Colonel Beverley married family Villiers, issue his marriage two sons two daughters; his zeal sense duty induced him, commencement war, leave his wife family Arnwood, he fated never meet again. The news his death effect upon Mrs. Beverley, already worn anxiety her husband's account, months afterward she followed early tomb, leaving four children charge elderly relative, till time family Villiers could protect them; but, appear history, period possible. The life king many lives jeopardy, orphans remained Arnwood, still care elderly relation, time history commences. The New Forest, readers perhaps aware, first inclosed William Conqueror royal forest his amusement--for days crowned heads passionately fond chase; may also recollect his successor, William Rufus, met his death forest glancing arrow shot Sir Walter Tyrrell. Since time present day continued royal domain. At period writing, establishment verderers keepers, paid crown, amounting forty fifty men. At commencement civil war remained posts, soon found, disorganized state country, wages longer obtained; then, king decided upon raising army, Beverley, held superior office Forest, enrolled young athletic men employed Forest, marched away join king's army. Some remained, age rendering services value, among old attached servant Beverley, man sixty years age, whose name Jacob Armitage, obtained situation Colonel Beverley's interest. Those remained Forest lived cottages many miles asunder, indemnified non-payment salaries killing deer sale subsistence. The cottage Jacob Armitage situated skirts New Forest, mile half mansion Arnwood; Colonel Beverley went join king's troops, feeling little security would his wife children troubled times, he requested old man, his attachment family, lose sight Arnwood, call often possible see he could service Mrs. Beverley. The colonel would persuaded Jacob altogether taken his residence mansion, old man objected. He his life greenwood tree, could bear leave forest. He promised colonel he would watch his family, ever hand required; he kept his word. The death Colonel Beverley heavy blow old forester, he watched Mrs. Beverley orphans greatest solicitude; Mrs. Beverley followed her husband tomb, he redoubled his attentions, seldom hours time away mansion. The two boys his inseparable companions, he instructed them, young were, secrets his calling. Such state affairs time King Charles made his escape Hampton Court; I shall resume narrative broken off. As soon escape Charles I. made known Cromwell Parliament, troops horse dispatched every direction southward, toward prints horses' hoofs proved he gone. As found he proceeded direction New Forest, troops subdivided ordered scour forest, parties twelve twenty, others hastened Southampton, Lymington, every seaport part coast king might likely embark. Old Jacob Arnwood day before, day he made his mind procure venison, he might go empty-handed; Miss Judith Villiers partial venison, slow remind Jacob, larder many days deficient meat. Jacob gone accordingly; he gained his leeward position fine buck, gradually nearing stealth--now behind huge oak tree, crawling high fern, get within shot unperceived, sudden animal, quietly feeding, bounded away disappeared thicket. At time Jacob perceived small body horse galloping glen buck feeding. Jacob never yet seen Parliamentary troops, war sent part country, iron skull-caps, buff accouterments, dark habiliments assured must be; different gayly-equipped Cavalier cavalry commanded Prince Rupert. At time advanced, Jacob lying fern near low black-thorn bushes; wishing perceived them, he drew back bushes, intending remain concealed gallop sight; Jacob thought, "I king's forester, may consider enemy, knows I may treated them?" But Jacob disappointed his expectations troops riding past him; contrary, soon arrived oak tree within twenty yards he concealed, order given halt dismount; sabers horsemen clattered iron sheaths order obeyed, old man expected immediately discovered; one thorn bushes directly troopers, effectually concealed him. At last Jacob ventured raise his head peep bush; he perceived men loosening girths black horses, wiping away perspiration sides handfuls fern. A powerfully-formed man, appeared command others, standing his hand upon arched neck his steed, appeared fresh vigorous ever, although covered foam perspiration. "Spare rub down, men," said he, "for tried mettle horses, one half-hour's breathing-time. We must on, work Lord must done." "They say forest many miles length breadth," observed another men, "and may ride many mile purpose; James Southwold, living verderer; nay, I think he said he born bred woods. Was so, James Southwold?" "It even say," replied active-looking young man; "I born bred forest, father verderer me." Jacob Armitage, listened conversation, immediately recognized young man question. He one joined king's army verderers keepers. It pained much perceive one always considered frank, true-hearted young man, left forest fight defense his king, turned traitor, joined ranks enemy; Jacob thought much better James Southwold, he never quitted New Forest, corrupted evil company; "he good lad," thought Jacob, "and he traitor hypocrite." "If born bred forest, James Southwold," said leader troop, "you must fain know mazes paths. Now, call mind, secret hiding-places people may remain concealed; thickets may cover man horse? Peradventure thou mayest point spot man Charles may hidden?" "I know one dell, within mile Arnwood," replied James Southwold, "which might cover double troop eyes wary." "We ride there, then," replied leader. "Arnwood, sayest thou? property Malignant Cavalier Beverley, shot Naseby?" "Even so," replied Southwold; "and many time--that is, olden time, I regenerated--many day revelry I passed there; many cup good ale I quaffed." "And thou shalt quaff again," replied leader. "Good ale intended Malignants, serve diligently. After examined dell thou speakest of, direct horses' heads toward Arnwood." "Who knows man Charles may concealed Malignant's house?" observed another. "In day I say no," replied leader; "but night Cavaliers like roof heads; and, therefore, night, before, proceed thither." "I searched many abodes," observed another, "but search almost vain. What spring panels, secret doors, false ceilings, double walls, one may ferret forever, find nothing." "Yes," replied leader, "their abodes full popish abominations; one way sure; man Charles concealed house, I venture say I find him. Fire smoke bring forth; every Malignant's house within twenty miles I apply torch; must night, sure his housed day. James Southwold, thou knowest well mansion Arnwood?" "I know well way offices below--the buttery, cellar, kitchen; I say I ever apartments upper house." "That needeth not; thou canst direct us lower entrance sufficient." "That I, Master Ingram," replied Southwold, "and best ale used found." "Enough, Southwold, enough; work must done, diligently. Now, men, tighten girths; ride dell: conceals seek, shall conceal us till night, country shall lighted flames Arnwood, surround house prevent escape. Levelers, horse!" The troopers sprung upon saddles, went hard trot, Southwold leading way. Jacob remained among fern sight, rose up. He looked short time direction troopers gone, stooped take his gun, said, "There is providence this; yes, there is providence dog me, he would remained quiet long time. Who would ever thought James Southwold would turned traitor! traitor, he ready bite hand fed him, burn house ever welcomed him. This bad world, I thank Heaven I lived woods. But time lose;" old forester threw his gun his shoulder, hastened away direction his cottage. "And king escaped," thought Jacob, he went along, "and he may forest! Who knows he may Arnwood, he must hardly know go shelter? I must haste see Miss Judith immediately. 'Levelers, horse!' fellow said. What is Leveler?" thought Jacob. As perhaps readers may ask question, must know large proportion Parliamentary army time assumed name Levelers, consequence taken opinion every man equality, property equally divided. The hatred people one rank property, especially toward king's party, mostly consisted men rank property, unbounded, merciless cruel highest degree, throwing much fanatical bearing language distinguished Puritans. Cromwell great difficulty eventually putting down, he last accomplish hanging slaughtering many. Of Jacob knew nothing; he knew was, Arnwood burned night, would necessary remove family. As obtaining assistance oppose troopers, he knew impossible. As he thought must take place, he thanked God allowed gain knowledge happen, hastened his way. He eight miles Arnwood he concealed fern. Jacob first went his cottage deposit his gun, saddled his forest pony, set Arnwood. In less two hours old man door mansion; three of the clock afternoon, month November, much two hours daylight remaining. "I shall difficult job stiff old lady," thought Jacob, rung bell; "I do not believe she would rise her high chair old Noll his whole army his back. But shall see." CHAPTER II. Before Jacob admitted presence Miss Judith Villiers, must give account establishment Arnwood. With exception one male servant, officiated house stable his services might required, every man household Colonel Beverley followed fortunes master, none returned, they, probability shared his fate. Three female servants, man mentioned, composed whole household. Indeed, every reason increasing establishment, rents either paid part, paid all. It generally supposed property, Parliament gained day, would sequestrated, although yet case; tenants unwilling pay, authorized receive, rents might called upon make good. Miss Judith Villiers, therefore, found difficult maintain present household; although she tell Jacob Armitage case, fact was, often venison he brought mansion meat larder. The three female servants held offices cook, attendant upon Miss Villiers, housemaid; children care particular servant, left much themselves. There chaplain house, he quitted death Mrs. Beverley, vacancy filled up; indeed, could well be, one left received his salary many months, Miss Judith Villiers, expecting every day summoned her relations bring children join them, sat her high chair waiting arrival summons, which, distracted state times, never come. As said, orphans four number; two eldest boys, youngest girls. Edward, eldest boy, thirteen fourteen years old; Humphrey, second, twelve; Alice, eleven; Edith, eight. As history young persons narrate, shall say little present, except many months little restraint, less attended to. Their companions Benjamin, man remained house, old Jacob Armitage, passed time he could spare them. Benjamin rather weak intellect, source amusement rather otherwise. As female servants, one wholly occupied her attendance Miss Judith, exacting, high notion her consequence. The two sufficient employment; as, money pay with, every thing must done home. That, circumstances, boys became boisterous little girls became romps, wondered at: become Miss Judith seldom admitting her room. It true sent day, ascertain house, existence, soon dismissed left resources. Such neglect young orphans exposed. It must, however, admitted, neglect made independent bold, full health constant activity, fitted change soon take place. "Benjamin," said Jacob, came door, "I must speak old lady." "Have brought venison, Jacob?" said Benjamin, grinning, "else, I reckon, you will welcome." "No, I not; important business, send Agatha her directly." "I will; I will say thing venison." In minutes, Jacob ushered Agatha Miss Judith Villiers's apartment. The old lady fifty years age, prim starched, sitting high-backed chair, her feet upon stool, her hands crossed her, her black mittens reposing upon her snow-white apron. The old forester made his obeisance. "You important business us, I told," observed Miss Judith. "Most important, madam," replied Jacob. "In first place, right informed his majesty, King Charles, escaped Hampton Court." "His majesty escaped!" replied lady. "Yes; supposed secreted somewhere neighborhood. His majesty house, madam, I presume?" "Jacob, his majesty house: he were, I would suffer tongue torn sooner I would confess it, even you." "But I private ear, madam." "Agatha, retire; Agatha, mindful go stairs, remain outside door." Agatha, injunction, bounced room, slamming-to door make Miss Judith start her seat. "Ill-mannered girl!" exclaimed Miss Judith. "Now, Jacob Armitage, may proceed." Jacob entered detail he overheard morning, he fell troopers, concluding information, mansion would burned night. He pointed necessity immediately abandoning house, would impossible oppose troopers. "And I go to, Jacob?" said Miss Judith, calmly. "I hardly know, madam; cottage; poor place, fit one like you." "So I presume, Jacob Armitage, neither shall I accept offer. It would ill befit dignity Villiers frightened her abode party rude soldiers. Happen will, I shall stir this--no, even chair. Neither I consider danger great suppose. Let Benjamin saddle, prepared ride Lymington immediately. I give letter magistrate there, send us protection." "But, madam, children remain here. I leave here. I promised colonel--" "Will children danger I shall be, Jacob Armitage?" replied old lady, stiffly. "They dare ill-treat me--they may force buttery drink ale--they may make merry venison brought you, I presume, hardly venture insult lady House Villiers." "I fear venture thing, madam. At events, frighten children, one night better cottage." "Well, then, so; take cottage, take Martha attend upon Miss Beverleys. Go now, desire Agatha come me, Benjamin saddle fast he can." Jacob left room, satisfied permission remove children. He knew useless argue Miss Judith, immovable she declared her intentions. He debating his mind whether he acquaint servants threatened danger; he occasion so, Agatha remained door Jacob communicating intelligence, soon he arrived portion she learned mansion burned night, run kitchen communicate intelligence servants. "I will stay burned death," exclaimed cook, Jacob came in. "Well, Mr. Armitage, pretty news brought. What lady say!" "She desires Benjamin saddles immediately, carry letter Lymington; you, Agatha, go stairs her." "But she mean do? Where go?" exclaimed Agatha. "Miss Judith intends remain she is." "Then she remain alone, me," exclaimed housemaid, admired Benjamin. "Its bad enough little victuals wages, burned death--Benjamin, put pillion behind saddle, I will go Lymington you. I will not long getting bundle." Benjamin, kitchen maids time Jacob entered, made sign significant consent, went away stable. Agatha went her mistress state great perturbation, cook also hurried away her bedroom. "They will leave her," thought Jacob; "well, duty plain; I will leave children house." Jacob went search them, found playing garden. He called two boys him, told follow him. "Now, Mr. Edward," said he, "you must prove father's son. We must leave house immediately; come rooms, help pack sisters' clothes, must go cottage night. There time lost." "But why, Jacob; I must know why?" "Because Parliamentary troopers burn night." "Burn down! Why, house mine, not? Who dares burn house?" "They dare it, it." "But fight them, Jacob; bolt bar; I fire gun, hit too, know; there is Benjamin you." "And two men troop horse, dear boy? If could defend place them, Jacob Armitage would first; impossible, dear boy. Recollect sisters. Would burned death, shot wretches? No, no, Mr. Edward; must I say, lose time. Let us pack useful, load White Billy bundles; must come cottage me, make can." "That jolly!" said Humphrey; "come, Edward." But Edward Beverley required persuasion abandon house; last, old Jacob prevailed, clothes put bundles fast could collect them. "Your aunt said Martha go sisters, I doubt she will," observed Jacob, "and I think shall room her, cottage small enough." "Oh no, do not want her," said Humphrey; "Alice always dresses Edith herself too, ever since mamma died." "Now carry bundles, make fast pony I go sisters." "But aunt Judith go?" inquired Edward. "She leave house, Master Edward; she intends stay speak troopers." "And old woman like her remains face enemy, I run away them!" replied Edward. "I go." "Well, Master Edward," replied Jacob, "you must please; cruel leave sisters here; Humphrey must come me, I manage get cottage without go us; far, return short time." To Edward consented. The pony soon loaded, little girls, still playing garden, called Humphrey. They told going pass night cottage, delighted idea. "Now, Master Edward," said Jacob, "will take sisters hand lead cottage? Here key door; Master Humphrey lead pony; Master Edward," continued Jacob, taking aside, "I will tell one thing I mention brother sisters: troopers New Forest, King Charles escaped, seeking him. You must not, therefore, leave brother sisters till I return. Lock cottage-door soon dark. You know get light, cupboard; gun loaded, hangs mantlepiece. You must best attempt force entrance; all, promise leave till I return. I remain see I aunt, I come back decide act." This latter ruse Jacob's succeeded. Edward promised he would leave his sisters, wanted minutes twilight little party quitted mansion Arnwood. As went gates passed Benjamin, trotting away Martha behind pillion, holding bundle large herself. Not word exchanged, Benjamin Martha soon sight. "Why, Martha going?" said Alice. "Will she back come home to-morrow?" Edward made reply, Humphrey said, "Well, she taken plenty clothes huge bundle one night, least." Jacob, soon he seen children way, returned kitchen, he found Agatha cook collecting property, evidently bent upon hasty retreat. "Have seen Miss Judith, Agatha?" "Yes; she told she remain, I stand behind her chair she might receive troopers dignity; I do not admire plan. They might leave her alone, I sure rude me." "When Benjamin say he would back?" "He do not intend coming back. He said he would not, events, till to-morrow morning, he would ride way, ascertain report false true. But Martha gone him." "I wish I could persuade old lady leave house," said Jacob, thoughtfully. "I fear pay her respect she calculates upon. Go up, Agatha, say I wish speak her." "No, I; I must off, dark already." "And going, then?" "To Gossip Allwood's. It is good mile, I carry things." "Well, Agatha, you will take old lady, I will carry things you." Agatha consented, soon she taken lamp, quite dark, Jacob introduced. "I wish, madam," said Jacob, "you would persuaded leave house night." "Jacob Armitage, leave house I not, filled troopers; I said so." "But, madam--" "No more, sir; forward," replied old lady, haughtily. "But, madam--" "Leave presence, Jacob Armitage, never appear again. Quit room, send Agatha here." "She left, madam, cook, Martha went away behind Benjamin; I leave, alone." "They dared leave?" "They dared stay, madam." "Leave me, Jacob Armitage, shut door go out." Jacob still hesitated. "Obey instantly," said old lady; forester, finding remonstrance useless, went out, obeyed her last commands shutting door him. Jacob found Agatha maid court-yard; he took packages, and, he promised, accompanied Gossip Allwood, kept small ale-house mile distant. "But, mercy us! become children?" said Agatha, walked along, her fears herself time made her utterly forgetful them. "Poor things! Martha left them." "Yes, indeed; become dear babes?" said cook, half crying. Now Jacob, knowing children Malignant Colonel Beverley would sorry treatment discovered, knowing also women always trusted, determined tell disposed of. He therefore replied, "Who would hurt young children those? No, no, safe enough; even troopers would protect them." "I hope so," replied Agatha. "You may sure that; man would hurt babies," replied Jacob. "The troopers take Lymington, I suppose. I have fear them; it is proud old lady uncivil to." The conversation ended, due time arrived inn. Jacob put bundles table, clattering horses' hoofs heard. Shortly afterward, troopers pulled horses door, dismounted. Jacob recognized party he met forest, among Southwold. The troopers called ale, remained time house, talking laughing women, especially Agatha, good-looking girl. Jacob would retreated quietly, he found sentinel posted door prevent egress person. He reseated himself, he listening conversation troopers he recognized Southwold, accosted him. Jacob pretend know him, would useless; Southwold put many questions resident Arnwood. Jacob replied children there, servants, he mention Miss Judith Villiers, thought struck him--he might save old lady. "You going Arnwood, I know," said Jacob, "and I heard search of. Well, Southwold, I will give hint. I may wrong; fall old lady something like one go Arnwood, mount her crupper away her Lymington fast ride. You understand me?" Southwold nodded significantly, squeezed Jacob's hand. "One word, Jacob Armitage; I succeed capture means, fair something hint. Where I find day to-morrow?" "I leaving country night, I must go. I trouble, that is fact; blown over, I find out. Do not speak now." Southwold squeezed Jacob's hand, left him. Shortly afterward order given mount, troopers set off. Armitage followed slowly unobserved. They arrive mansion surrounded it. Shortly afterward he perceived glare torches, quarter hour thick smoke rose dark clear sky; last flames burst forth lower windows mansion, soon afterward lighted country round distance. "It done," thought Jacob; he turned bend his hasty steps toward his cottage, he heard galloping horse violent screams; minute afterward James Southwold passed old lady tied behind him, kicking struggling hard she could. Jacob smiled he thought he his little stratagem saved old woman's life, Southwold imagined she King Charles dressed old woman evident; he returned fast he could cottage. In half hour Jacob passed thick woods mansion his cottage, occasionally looking back, flames mansion rose higher higher, throwing light far wide. He knocked cottage-door; Smoker, large dog cross-bred fox blood-hound, growled till Jacob spoke him, Edward opened door. "My sisters bed fast asleep, Jacob," said Edward, "and Humphrey nodding half hour; he better go bed go back?" "Come out, Master Edward," replied Jacob, "and look." Edward beheld flames fierce light trees silent. "I told would so, would burned beds, enter house see it, fired soon surrounded it." "And aunt!" exclaimed Edward, clasping his hands. "Is safe, Master Edward, time Lymington." "We go her to-morrow." "I fear not; must risk much, Master Edward. These Levelers spare nobody, better let supposed burned house." "But aunt knows contrary, Jacob." "Very true; I quite forgot that." And Jacob had. He expected old woman would burned, nobody would known existence children; he forgot, he planned save her, she knew children were. "Well, Master Edward, I go Lymington to-morrow see old lady; must remain here, take charge sisters till I come back, consider done. The flames bright were." "No. It house Roundheads burned down," said Edward, shaking his fist. "It house, Master Edward, property, long remains seen. I fear forfeited." "Woe people dare take possession it!" cried Edward; "I shall, I live, man one days." "Yes, Master Edward, reflect now, rash. Let us go cottage, it is use remaining cold; frost sharp to-night." Edward slowly followed Jacob cottage. His little heart full. He proud boy good boy, destruction mansion raised evil thoughts his heart--hatred Covenanters, killed his father burned property--revenge upon (how he knew not); his hand ready strike, young he was. He lay bed, he could sleep. He turned turned again, his brain teeming thoughts plans vengeance. Had he said his prayers night he would obliged repeat, "Forgive us forgive trespass us." At last, he fell fast asleep, his dreams wild, he often called night woke his brother sisters. CHAPTER III. The next morning, soon Jacob given children breakfast, he set toward Arnwood. He knew Benjamin stated his intention return horse see taken place, he knew well enough feel sure he would so. He thought better see possible, ascertain fate Miss Judith. Jacob arrived still smoking ruins mansion, found several people there, mostly residents within miles, attracted curiosity, others busy collecting heavy masses lead melted roof, appropriating benefit; much still hot touched, throwing snow cool it, snowed night. At last, Jacob perceived Benjamin horseback riding leisurely toward him, immediately went him. "Well, Benjamin, woeful sight. What news Lymington?" "Lymington full troopers, over-civil," replied Benjamin. "And old lady--where she?" "Ah, that is sad business," replied Benjamin, "and poor children, too. Poor Master Edward! he would made brave gentleman." "But old lady safe," rejoined Jacob. "Did see her?" "Yes, I saw her; thought she King Charles--poor old soul." "But found mistake time?" "Yes, James Southwold found too," replied Benjamin; "to think old lady breaking his neck!" "Breaking his neck? You do not say so! How it?" "Why, seems Southwold thought she King Charles dressed old woman, he seized her strapped her fast behind him, galloped away her Lymington; she struggled kicked manfully, he could hold on, went together, he broke his neck." "Indeed! A judgment--a judgment upon traitor," said Jacob. "They picked up, strapped together were, troopers, carried Lymington." "Well, old lady, then? Did see speak her?" "I saw her, Jacob, I speak her. I forgot say that, she broke Southwold's neck, she broke her too." "Then old lady dead?" "Yes, she is," replied Benjamin; "but cares her? it is poor children I pity. Martha crying ever since." "I do not wonder." "I Cavalier, troopers there, boasting done, called righteous work. I could stand that, I asked one righteous work burn poor children beds? So he turned round, struck his sword upon floor, asked whether I one them--'Who you, then?' I--all courage went away, I answered, I poor rat-catcher. 'A rat-catcher; you? Well, then, Mr. Ratcatcher, killing rats, find nest young ones, do not kill too? leave grow, become mischievous, eh?' 'I kill young ones, course,' replied I. 'Well, Malignants whenever find them.' I did not say word more, I went house fast I could." "Have heard thing king?" inquired Jacob. "No, nothing; troopers again, and, I hear, gone forest." "Well, Benjamin, good-by, I shall part country--it is use staying here. Where is Agatha cook?" "They came Lymington early morning." "Wish good-by me, Benjamin." "Where going, then?" "I cannot exactly say, I think London way. I staid watch children; gone, I shall leave Arnwood forever." Jacob, anxious, account intelligence he received troopers forest, return cottage, shook hands Benjamin, hastened away. "Well," thought Jacob, he wended his way, "I am sorry poor old lady, still, perhaps, it is best. Who knows might children! Destroy nest well rats, indeed! must find nest first." And old forester continued his journey deep thought. We may observe that, blood-thirsty many Levelers were, think Jacob Armitage grounds fears he expressed felt; say, believe he might made known existence children Villiers family, would never harmed body. That burning mansion might perished flames, bed, would hour, he obtained intelligence done, true; danger account father stanch supporter king's because, unlikely, borne history times: old forester thought otherwise; he hatred Puritans, deeds exaggerated rumor, he fully believed lives children safe. Under conviction, feeling bound his promise Colonel Beverley protect them, Jacob resolved live forest, brought his grandchildren. He knew could better place concealment; for, except keepers, people knew his cottage was; usual paths, imbosomed lofty trees, little chance seen, known exist. He resolved, therefore, remain till better times; he would make known existence branches family, before. "I hunt them, provide them," thought he, "and I little money, required; I teach useful; must learn provide themselves. There is garden, patch land: two three years, boys able something. I cannot teach much; I teach fear God. We must get can, put trust Him father fatherless." With thoughts running his head, Jacob arrived cottage, found children outside door, watching him. They hastened him, dog rushed them, welcome his master. "Down, Smoker, good dog! Well, Mr. Edward, I quick I could. How Mr. Humphrey sisters behaved? But must remain outside to-day, troopers scouring forest, may see you. Let us come directly, would come here." "Will burn cottage down?" inquired Alice, she took Jacob's hand. "Yes, dear, I think would, found brothers it; must let see you." They entered cottage, consisted one large room front, two back rooms bedrooms. There also third bedroom, behind two, furniture it. "Now, let us see dinner--there is venison left, I know," said Jacob; "come, must useful. Who cook?" "I cook," said Alice, "if show how." "So shall, dear," said Jacob, "and I show how. There is potatoes basket corner, onions hanging string; must water--who fetch it?" "I will," said Edward, took pail, went spring. The potatoes peeled washed children--Jacob Edward cut venison pieces--the iron pot cleaned; meat potatoes put water pot, placed fire. "Now I will cut onions, make eyes water." "I do not care," said Humphrey, "I will cut cry time." And Humphrey took knife, cut away manfully, although he obliged wipe his eyes his sleeve often. "You fine fellow, Humphrey," said Jacob. "Now we will put onions in, let boil together. Now see, cooked dinner; are not pleasant?" "Yes," cried all; "and eat dinners soon ready." "Then, Humphrey, must get platters drawer; and, Alice, find knives drawer. And let see, little Edith do? Oh, she go cupboard find salt-cellar. Edward, look out, see body coming passing, let know. We must put guard till troopers leave forest." The children set tasks, Humphrey cried out, he often did, "Now, jolly!" While dinner cooking, Jacob amused children showing put things order; floor swept, hearth made tidy. He shewed Alice wash cloth, Humphrey dust chairs. They worked merrily, little Edith stood clapped her hands. But dinner ready, Edward came said, "Here troopers galloping forest!" Jacob went out, observed coming direction would lead near cottage. He walked in, and, moment's thought, he said, "My dear children, men may come search cottage; must I tell you, mind quiet. Humphrey, sisters must go bed, pretend ill. Edward, take coat put old hunting-frock mine. You must bedroom attending sick brother sisters. Come, Edith, dear, must play going bed, dinner afterward." Jacob took children bedroom, and, removing upper dress, would betrayed children poor people, put bed, covered chins clothes. Edward put old hunting-shirt, came his knees, stood mug water his hand bedside two girls. Jacob went outer room, remove platters laid dinner; he hardly done he heard noise troopers, soon afterward knock cottage-door. "Come in," said Jacob. "Who you, friend?" said leader troop, entering door. "A poor forester, sir," replied Jacob, "under great trouble." "What trouble, man?" "I children bed small-pox." "Nevertheless, must search cottage." "You welcome," replied Jacob; "only do not frighten children, help it." The man, joined others, commenced his search. Jacob opened doors rooms, passed through. Little Edith shrieked she saw them; Edward patted her, told her frightened. The troopers, however, took notice children; searched thoroughly, came back front room. "It is use remaining here," said one troopers. "Shall off! I am tired hungry ride." "So I, there is something smells well." said another. "What is this, good man?" continued he, taking lid pot. "My dinner week," replied Jacob. "I one cook now, cannot light fire every day." "Well, appear live well, mess every day week. I like try spoonful two." "And welcome, sir," replied Jacob; "I cook myself." The troopers took his word; sat table, soon whole contents kettle disappeared. Having satisfied themselves, got up, told his rations good hoped call again; and, laughing heartily, mounted horses, rode away. "Well," said Jacob, "they welcome dinner; I little thought get cheap." As soon sight, Jacob called Edward children get again, soon did. Alice put Edith's frock, Humphrey put his jacket, Edward pulled hunting-shirt. "They are gone now," said Jacob, coming door. "And dinners gone," said Humphrey, looking empty pot dirty platters. "Yes; cook another, play know," said Jacob. "Edward, go water; Humphrey, cut onions; Alice, wash potatoes; Edith, help everybody, I cut meat." "I hope good," observed Humphrey; "that smell nice!" "Quite good, better; shall improve practice, shall better appetite eat with," said Jacob. "Nasty men eat dinner," said Edith. "Shall not more. Eat ourselves." And soon cooked; hungry sat down. "This jolly!" said Humphrey his mouth full. "Yes, Master Humphrey. I doubt King Charles eats good dinner day. Mr. Edward, grave silent." "Yes, I am, Jacob. Have I because? Oh, I could mauled troopers!" "But could not; must make best it. They say every dog his day, knows King Charles may throne again!" There visits cottage day, went bed, slept soundly. The next morning, Jacob, anxious learn news, saddled pony, first given his injunctions Edward behave case troopers come cottage. He told pretend children bed small-pox, done day before. Jacob traveled Gossip Allwood's, he learned King Charles taken prisoner, Isle Wight, troopers going back London fast came. Feeling danger apprehended them, Jacob set fast he could Lymington. He went one shop purchased two peasant dresses he thought would fit two boys, another he bought similar apparel two girls. Then, several ready-made articles, things required household, he made large package, he put upon pony, and, taking bridle, set home, arrived time superintend cooking dinner, day venison-steaks fried pan, boiled potatoes. When dinner over, he opened his bundle, told little ones that, live cottage, ought wear cottage clothes, he bought put on, might rove woods in, mind tearing them. Alice Edith went bedroom, Alice dressed Edith herself, came quite pleased change dress. Humphrey Edward put sitting-room, fitted pretty well, certainly becoming children. "Now, recollect, grandchildren," said Jacob; "for I shall longer call Miss Master--that never cottage. You understand me, Edward, course?" added Jacob. Edward nodded his head; Jacob telling children might go cottage play, set off, quite delighted clothes procured liberty. We must describe cottage Jacob Armitage, children future dwell. As said before, contained large sitting-room, kitchen, spacious hearth chimney, table, stools, cupboards, dressers: two bedrooms adjoined appropriated, one Jacob two boys; third, inner bedroom, arranged two girls, retired secure. But outhouses belonging it: stall, White Billy, pony, lived winter; she would pigsty rudely constructed, inclosed yard attached them; had, moreover, piece ground acre, well fenced keep deer game, largest portion cultivated garden potato-ground, other, remained grass, contained fine old apple pear-trees. Such domicile; pony, fowls, sow two young pigs, dog Smoker, animals establishment. Here Jacob Armitage born--for cottage built his grandfather--but he always remained cottage. When young, he felt inclination see world, several years served army. His father brother lived establishment Arnwood, he constantly boy The chaplain Arnwood taken fancy him, taught read--writing he acquired. As soon he grew up, he served, said, troop commanded Colonel Beverley's father; and, his death, Colonel Beverley procured situation forest ranger, held his father, alive, aged duty. Jacob Armitage married good devout young woman, he lived several years, she died, without bringing family; which, his father also dead, Jacob Armitage lived alone period commenced history. CHAPTER IV. The old forester lay awake whole night, reflecting he act relative children; he felt great responsibility he incurred, alarmed he considered might consequences his days shortened. What would become them--living sequestered spot knew even existence--totally shut world, left resources? He fear, his life spared, would well; he called away grown able help themselves, might perish. Edward fourteen years old; true he active, brave boy, thoughtful his years; he yet strength skill sufficient would required. Humphrey, second, also promised well; still children. "I must bring useful--to depend upon themselves; moment lost, moment shall lost; I best, trust God; I ask two three years, time I trust able without me. They must commence to-morrow life foresters' children." Acting upon resolution, Jacob, soon children dressed, sitting-room, opened his Bible, he put table, said: "My dear children, know must remain cottage, wicked troopers may find out; killed father, I taken away, would burned beds. You must, therefore, live children, must call name Armitage, Beverley; must dress like children forest, now, must children forest do--that is, must every thing yourselves, servants wait upon you. We must work--but like work work together, work nothing play. Now, Edward oldest, he must go forest, I must teach kill deer game support; he knows how, Humphrey shall come learn shoot." "Yes," said Humphrey, "I will soon learn." "But yet, Humphrey, must work mean time; must look pony pigs, must learn dig garden Edward go hunt; sometimes I shall go myself, leave Edward work work done. Alice, dear, must, Humphrey, light fire clean house morning. Humphrey go spring water, hard work; must learn wash, dear Alice--I show how; must learn get dinner ready Humphrey, assist you; make beds. And little Edith shall take care fowls, feed every morning, look eggs--will you, Edith?" "Yes," replied Edith, "and feed little chickens hatched, I Arnwood." "Yes, dear, you will useful. Now know once. You try try again; soon will, play. I must teach all, every day better, till want teaching all. And now, dear children, chaplain here, must read Bible every morning. Edward read, I know; you, Humphrey?" "Yes, except big words." "Well, learn by-and-by. And Edward I teach Alice Edith read evenings, nothing do. It amusement. Now tell me, like I told you?" "Yes," replied; Jacob Armitage read chapter Bible, knelt said Lord's prayer. As done every morning every evening, I need repeat again. Jacob showed clean house, Humphrey Alice soon finished work his directions; sat breakfast, plain one, generally cold meat, cakes baked embers, Alice soon expert; little Edith useful watching her, she busied herself her work. But venison nearly gone; breakfast Jacob Edward, dog Smoker, went woods. Edward gun, he went taught approach game, required great caution; indeed Jacob second gun give him, he wished do. "Now, Edward, going fine stag, find him, I doubt not; difficulty is, get within shot him. Recollect must always hid, his sight quick; never heard, his ear sharp; never come wind, his scent fine. Then must hunt according hour day. At time he feeding; two hours hence he lying high fern. The dog use unless stag badly wounded, dog take him. Smoker knows his duty well, hide close do. We going thick wood ahead us, many little spots cleared ground may find deer; must keep left, wind eastward, must walk it. And coming wood, recollect, word must said, must walk quietly possible, keeping behind me. Smoker, heel!" They proceeded wood mile, Jacob made sign Edward, dropped fern, crawling along open spot, where, distance, stag three deer grazing. The deer grazed quietly, stag ever anon raising his head snuffing air he looked round, evidently acting sentinel females. The stag perhaps long quarter mile crouched fern. Jacob remained immovable till animal began feed again, he advanced, crawling fern, followed Edward dog, dragged his stomach Edward. This tedious approach continued time, neared stag within half original distance, animal lifted his head appeared uneasy. Jacob stopped remained without motion. After time stag walked away, followed does, opposite side clear spot feeding, and, Edward's annoyance, animal half mile them. Jacob turned round crawled wood, he knew concealed, he rose his feet said, "You see, Edward, requires patience stalk deer. What princely fellow! he probably alarmed morning, uneasy. Now must go woods till come lee side dell. You see he led close thicket, shall better chance get there, quiet cautious." "What startled him, think?" said Edward. "I think, crawling fern me, broke piece rotten stick you. Did not?" "Yes, made little noise." "Quite enough startle red deer, Edward, find long forester. These checks happen, happened hundred times, work done again. Now make circuit--we better say word. If get safe side, sure him." They proceeded quick walk forest, half hour gained side deer feeding. When three hundred yards game, Jacob sunk his hands knees, crawling bush bush, stopping whenever stag raised his head, advancing resumed feeding; last came fern side wood, crawled before, still cautiously approached stag. In manner arrived last within eighty yards animal, Jacob advanced his gun ready put his shoulder, and, he cocked lock, raised fire. The click occasioned cocking lock roused stag instantly, he turned his head direction whence noise proceeded; he Jacob fired, aiming behind animal's shoulder: stag made bound, came again, dropped his knees, attempted run, fell dead, fled away rapidity wind. Edward started his legs shout exultation. Jacob commenced reloading his gun, stopped Edward he run animal lay. "Edward, must learn craft," said Jacob; "never again; never shout way--on contrary, remained still fern." "Why so?--the stag dead." "Yes, dear boy, stag dead; know may another lying fern close us, distance us, alarmed shout? Suppose guns, report mine started another stag lying fern within shot, would able shoot it; stag lying distance, report gun might started induce move his head without rising. I seen his antlers move marked his lair, gone stalked too." "I see," replied Edward, "I wrong; I shall know better another time." "That is I tell you, boy," replied Jacob. "Now let us go quarry. Ay, Edward, noble beast. I thought he hart royal, he is." "What hart royal, Jacob?" "Why, stag called brocket he three years old, four years he staggart; five years warrantable stag; five years he becomes hart royal." "And know his age?" "By his antlers: see stag nine antlers; now, brocket two antlers, staggart three, warrantable stag four; six years old, antlers increase number sometimes twenty thirty. This fine beast, venison getting good. Now must see work craft." Jacob cut throat animal, afterward cut head took bowels. "Are tired, Edward?" said Jacob, he wiped his hunting-knife coat stag. "No, least." "Well, then, now, I think, four five miles cottage. Could find way home? consequence--Smoker lead home shortest path. I stay here, saddle White Billy come back him, he must carry venison back. It is manage--indeed, much manage White Billy help us. There is twenty stone venison lying there, I tell you." Edward immediately assented, Jacob, desiring Smoker go home, set flaying cutting animal convenient transportation. In hour half, Edward, attended Smoker, returned pony, whose back chief portion venison packed. Jacob took large piece his shoulders, Edward carried another, Smoker, regaling portion inside animal, came them. During walk home, Jacob initiated Edward terms venery many points connected deer-stalking, shall trouble readers. As soon arrived cottage, venison hung up, pony put stable, sat dinner excellent appetite long morning's walk. Alice Humphrey cooked dinner themselves, pot, smoking hot, returned; Jacob declared he never ate better mess his life. Alice little proud this, praises she received Edward old forester. The next day, Jacob stated his intention going Lymington dispose large portion venison, bring back sack oatmeal cakes. Edward asked accompany him, Jacob replied, "Edward, must think showing Lymington, else, long while, grown memory. It would folly, would risk sisters' brother's lives, perhaps, well own. Never mention again: time come necessary, perhaps; so, helped. At present would known immediately. No, Edward, I tell I mean do: I little money left, I intend buy gun, may learn stalk deer without me; for, recollect, accident happen me, provide brother sisters? At Lymington I known many; know me, one knows cottage is; know I live New Forest, I supply venison, purchase articles return. That know: I may therefore go without fear. I shall sell venison to-morrow, bring back good gun; Humphrey shall carpenters' tools he wishes for, I think, he his knife, he turn way, may useful. I must also get tools Humphrey you, shall able work together; threads needles Alice, she sew little, practice make her perfect." Jacob went Lymington he proposed, returned late night White Billy well loaded; he sack oatmeal, spades hoes, saw chisels, tools; two scythes two three-pronged forks; Edward came meet him, he put his hand gun long barrel. "I believe, Edward, find good one, I know came from. It belonged one rangers, reckoned best shot Forest. I know gun, I seen his arm, taken hand examine once. He killed Naseby, father, poor fellow! his widow sold gun meet her wants." "Well," replied Edward, "I thank much, Jacob, I try I kill much venison pay back purchase-money--I will, I assure you." "I shall glad do, Edward; I want money back, I shall easy mind all, thing happens me. As soon perfect woodcraft, I shall take Humphrey hand, nothing like two strings bow. To-morrow go out: meat enough three weeks more; frost set in, keep well. You shall practice mark gun, may accustomed it; guns, even best, require little humoring." Edward, often fired gun before, proved next morning he good eye; and, two three hours' practice, hit mark hundred yards almost every time. "I wish would let go myself," said Edward, overjoyed his success. "You would bring home nothing, boy," replied Jacob. "No, no, great deal learn yet; I tell shall do: time great want venison, shall first fire." "Well, do," replied Edward. The winter set great severity, remained almost altogether within doors. Jacob boys went get firewood, dragged home snow. "I wish, Jacob," said Humphrey, "that I able build cart, would useful, White Billy would something do; I cannot make wheels, harness." "That is bad idea yours, Humphrey," replied Jacob; "we think it. If cannot build cart, perhaps I buy one. It would useful take dung yard potato-ground, I hitherto carried baskets, it is hard work." "Yes, might saw wood billets, carry home cart, instead dragging way; shoulder quite sore rope, cuts so." "Well, weather breaks up, I see I do, Humphrey; roads blocked up, I think could get cart Lymington cottage, although horse, perhaps." But remained in-doors inclement weather, idle. Jacob took opportunity instruct children every thing. Alice learned wash cook. It true, sometimes she scalded herself little, sometimes burned her fingers; accidents occur, articles employed heavy lift themselves; practice dexterity compensated want strength, fewer accidents happened every day. Humphrey his carpenters' tools; although first he many failures, wasted nails wood, degrees he learned use his tools dexterity, made several little useful articles. Little Edith could something, she made baked oatmeal cakes, saved Alice good deal time trouble watching them. It astonishing much children could do, one them; daily instruction Jacob. In evening Alice sat her needle thread mend clothes; first well done, she improved every day. Edith Humphrey learned read Alice worked, Alice learned; thus passed winter away rapidly, that, although five months cottage, appear many weeks. All happy contented, exception, perhaps, Edward, fits gloominess, occasionally showed signs impatience passing world, he remained ignorance. That Edward Beverley fits gloominess impatience surprising. Edward brought heir Arnwood; boy early age imbibes notions his position, promises high one. He two miles property right his own. His mansion reduced ashes--he hidden forest; he could feel his position. He sighed time king's triumphant, his arrival age he could person support uphold because. He longed command, his father been--to lead his men victory--to recover his property, revenge acted cruelly toward him. This human nature; much Jacob Armitage would expostulate him, try divert his feelings channels--long he would preach forgiveness injuries, patience better times come, Edward could help brooding thoughts, ever breast animated intense hatred Puritans, Edward Beverley. Although lamented, could create surprise wonder old forester. All he could was, much possible reason him, soothe his irritated feelings, constant employment try make forget time feelings ill-will he conceived. One thing was, however, sufficiently plain Edward, was, whatever might his wrongs, he power present redress them; feeling, perhaps, other, held sort check; time he might opportunity appeared far distant, even his sanguine imagination, degrees he contrive dismiss his thoughts use think present. CHAPTER V. As said, time passed rapidly; exception one two excursions venison, remained cottage, Jacob never went Lymington. The frost broken up, snow long disappeared, trees began bud. The sun became powerful, month May forest began look green. "And now, Edward," said Jacob Armitage, one day breakfast, "we try venison sell Lymington, I must purchase Humphrey's cart harness; let us get guns, go fine morning. The stags mostly season, young calves. We must find slot deer, track his lair, shall first shot like; but, that, however, depends upon deer upon me." They walked four five miles came upon slot track deer, Jacob's practiced eye pointed Edward slot young one, worth following. He explained Edward difference hoof-marks signs knowledge gained, proceeded onward found another slot, Jacob declared warrantable stag--that is, one old enough kill good venison. "We must track his lair, Edward." This took mile farther, arrived small thicket thorns acre extent. "Here he is, see, Edward; let see he harbored." They walked round thicket, could find slot track stag left covert, Jacob pronounced animal must hid it. "Now, Edward, stay I go back lee side covert: I enter Smoker, stag will, probability, he roused, come breast wind. You good shot him; recollect fire hit behind shoulder: he moving quick, fire little shoulders; slow, take aim accurately; recollect, I come upon covert, I shall kill I can, want venison, go another give chance." Jacob left Edward, went lee side covert, he entered Smoker. Edward stationed behind thorn-bush, grew yards clear covert, he soon heard creaking branches. A short time elapsed, fine stag came trot; he turned his head, bounding away Edward fired, animal fell. Remembering advice Jacob, Edward remained he was, silence reloading his piece, soon afterward joined Jacob dog. "Well done, Edward!" said forester, low voice; and, covering his forehead keep glare sun, he looked earnestly high brake thorn-trees, half mile windward. "I think I see something there--look Edward, eyes younger mine. Is branch tree fern, not?" "I see mean," replied Edward. "It not, moves." "I thought so, eyes good were. It is another stag, depend upon it; get near him? We never get across patch clear grass without seen." "No, get spot," replied Edward; "but fall back leeward, gain forest again, I think thorns sufficient forest he lies, creep behind one other, get shot him, do not you?" "It require care patience manage that; I think might done. I try it; turn now, know. You better stay dog, one hide thorn thorn." Jacob, ordering Smoker remain, set off. He make circuit three miles get spot thorns extended forest, Edward saw him, although he strained his eyes, stag sprung out, gun discharged. Edward perceived stag killed, severely wounded, running toward covert near he hid. "Down, Smoker," said he, he cocked his gun. The stag came within shot, coming nearer, when, seeing Edward, turned. Edward fired, cheered dog, sprung wounded animal, giving tongue, he followed him. Edward, perceiving Jacob hastening toward him, waited him. "He is hard hit, Edward," cried Jacob, "and Smoker him; must follow fast can." They caught guns ran fast could, when, entered wood, heard dog bay. "We shall not far go, Edward; animal done up: Smoker bay." They hastened another quarter mile, found stag fallen his knees, seized throat Smoker. "Mind, Edward, now, I go him, wound horn deer dangerous." Jacob advanced behind stag, cut his throat his hunting-knife. "He fine beast, done well to-day, shall two journeys make get venison home. I could get fair shot him--and see, I hit flank." "And ball his throat," said Edward. "So is. Then good shot made, master hunt day, Edward. Now, I will remain, go home White Billy. Humphrey right cart. If one, could carried home once; I must go cut throat stag killed cleverly. You good hunter one days, Edward. A little knowledge, little practice, I leave you, hang gun chimney." It late evening made two trips taken venison home, tired safely housed. Edward delighted his success, old Jacob. The next morning, Jacob set Lymington, pony loaded venison, he sold, well two loads he promised bring next day, day after. He looked cart, fortunate finding small one, fitted size pony, tall strong, New Forest ponies are. He also procured harness, put Billy cart draw home; Billy admire put cart, time restive, backed reared, went every way right; dint coaxing leading, he last submitted, went straight on; noise cart behind frightened him, he ran away. At last, tired out, he thought he might well go quietly harness, he could get it; he so, arrived safe cottage. Humphrey delighted sight cart, said get well. The next day, Jacob contrived put remainder venison cart, White Billy made difficulty; he dragged Lymington, returned cart quietly cleverly he harness his life. "Well, Edward, venison paid cart events," said Jacob, "and now, I tell news I collected I Lymington. Captain Burly, attempted incite people rescue king, hung, drawn, quartered, traitor." "They traitors condemned him," replied Edward, wrath. "Yes, are; better news, is, Duke York escaped Holland." "Yes, good news; king?" "He still prisoner Carisbrook Castle. There many rumors talks, one knows true false; depend upon it, last long, king his rights yet." Edward remained grave time. "I trust Heaven shall rights yet, Jacob," said he last. "I wish I man!" Here conversation ended, went bed. This busy time cottage. The manure got stable pigsties, carried potato-ground garden; crops put in, cart found valuable. After manure carried spread, Edward Humphrey helped Jacob dig ground, put seed. The cabbage-plants last year put out, turnips carrots sown. Before month over, garden potato-field cropped, Humphrey took upon weed keep clean. Little Edith also employment now, hens began lay eggs, soon she heard cackling, she ran eggs brought in; month over, Jacob set four hens upon eggs. Billy, pony, turned graze forest; he came home every night his accord. "I will tell want," said Humphrey, took command altogether farm: "we want cow." "Oh yes, cow," cried Alice, "I plenty time milk her." "Whose cows I see forest sometimes?" said Humphrey Jacob. "If belong body, belong king," replied Jacob; "but cattle strayed found way forest, remained ever since. They rather wild savage, must careful go near them, bulls run you. They increase fast: six years ago, least fifty herd." "Well, I will try get one, I can," said Humphrey. "You puzzled that, boy," replied Jacob, "and I said before, beware bulls." "I do not want bull," replied Humphrey, "but cow would give us milk, manure garden. My garden grow potatoes." "Well, Humphrey, catch cow, one interfere; I think find easy, may find dangerous." "I will look one," replied Humphrey, "any how. Alice, cow, would not jolly?" The crops up, days began long, work became comparatively light easy. Humphrey busy making little wheelbarrow Edith, she might barrow away weeds he hoed up; last great performance completed, much admiration all, much his satisfaction. Indeed, recollected Humphrey hand-saw ax, he cut tree; saw plank, must acknowledged required great patience perseverance even make wheelbarrow; Humphrey persevering, full invention. He built hen-house fir-poles, made nests hens lay hatch in, forty fifty chickens running about. He also divided pigsty, sow might kept apart pigs; expected soon litter young pigs. He transplanted wild strawberries forest, had, manure, made large good; he also fine crop onions garden, seed Jacob bought Lymington; Humphrey busy cutting poles forest make cow-house, he declared he would cow somehow another. June arrived, time mow grass make hay winter, Jacob two scythes. He showed boys use them, soon became expert; plenty long grass time year, could mow pleased, soon White Billy full employment carrying hay home. The little girls helped make it, Humphrey made two rakes. Jacob thought hay enough made, Humphrey said enough pony, enough cow. "But cow come from, Humphrey?" "Where venison comes from," replied he: "out forest." So Humphrey continued mow make hay, Edward Jacob went venison. After hay made stacked, Humphrey found method thatching fern, Jacob never thought of; done, commenced cutting fern fodder. Here Humphrey would twice much Jacob ever cut before, he wanted litter cow. At last became quite joke Edward, who, he brought home venison would keep hot weather, told Humphrey remainder cow. Still Humphrey would give point, every morning evening he would certain absent hour two, found he watching herd wild cattle feeding: sometimes near, others long way off. He used get trees, examine passed without perceiving him. One night Humphrey returned late, next morning he daylight. Breakfast over, Humphrey make his appearance, could tell matter. Jacob felt uneasy, Edward laughed, said: "Oh, depend upon it, he will come back bring cow him." Hardly Edward said words came Humphrey, red perspiration. "Now then, Jacob Edward, come me; must put Billy cart, take Smoker rope us. Take guns too, fear accident." "Why, what is matter?" "I will tell go along; I must put Billy cart, time lost." Humphrey disappeared, Jacob said Edward-- "What be?" "It nothing cow he mad about," replied Edward. "However, he comes pony, shall know; let us take guns dog Smoker he wishes." Humphrey drove pony cart, set off. "Well, I suppose you will tell us going for?" said Edward. "Yes, I will. You know I have watching cattle long while, I wanted cow. I tree passed several times, I observed one two heifers near calving. Yesterday evening I thought one could help calving soon indeed, I watching, I saw she uneasy, she last left herd went little copse wood. I remained three hours see she came again, she not. It dark I came home, know. This morning I went daylight found herd. She remarkable, black white spotted; and, close examination, I found she herd; I sure she went copse calve, she calved this." "Well, may be," replied Jacob; "but I understand do." "Nor I," replied Edward. "Well, then, I will tell I hope do. I got pony cart take calf home us, get it--which I think can. I got Smoker worry heifer keep her employed, put calf cart; rope may tie cow can; guns must keep herd come her assistance. Now understand plan?" "Yes, I think likely succeed, Humphrey," replied Jacob, "and I give credit scheme. We help can. Where copse?" "Not half mile farther," replied Humphrey. "We shall soon there." On arrival, found herd feeding considerable distance copse, was, perhaps, well. "Now," said Jacob, "I Edward enter copse Smoker, follow us, Humphrey. I make Smoker seize heifer, necessary; events he keep her bay--that is, she here. First, let us walk round copse find her _slot_, call track deer. See, her footing. Now let us go in." They advanced cautiously thicket, following track heifer, last came upon her. Apparently she calved hour, licking calf, yet legs. As soon animal perceived Jacob Edward, she shook her head, run them; Jacob told Smoker seize her, dog flew her immediately. The attack dog drove back heifer quite thicket, dog bounded round her, springing way way escape her horns, heifer soon separated calf. "Now then, Edward Humphrey," said Jacob, advancing heifer calf, "lift calf put cart. Leave Smoker manage mother." The boys put arms stomach calf, carried away. The heifer first busy defending herself dog perceive calf gone; she did, Jacob called Smoker him, bring heifer boys going thicket. At last heifer gave loud bellow, rushed thicket pursuit her calf, checked Smoker, held her ear, sometimes stopped her advancing. "Hold her, Smoker," said Jacob, went back help boys. "Hold her, boy. Is calf cart?" "Yes, tied fast," replied Edward, "and cart, too." "That is right," replied Jacob. "Now I will get too, let us drive off. She will follow us, depend upon it. Here, Smoker! Smoker! let her alone." Smoker, command, came bounding copse, followed heifer, lowing anxiously. Her lowing responded calf cart, she ran wildly it. "Drive off, Humphrey," said Jacob; "I think I heard lowing heifer answered herd, sooner better." Humphrey, reins, drove off; heifer followed, one time running dog, another putting her head almost hind part cart; lowing heifer answered deeper tones, Jacob said, "Edward, get gun ready, I think herd following. Do fire, however, I tell you. We must governed circumstances. It will not lose pony, run serious risk, sake heifer calf. Drive fast, Humphrey." A minutes afterward perceived, quarter mile behind them, whole herd, single bull, coming fast trot, his tail air, tossing his head, lowing deeply answer heifer. "There is one, all," said Jacob; "I suppose heifer his favorite. Well, manage him. Smoker, come in. Come in, sir, directly," cried Jacob, perceiving dog attack bull. Smoker obeyed, bull advanced till he within hundred yards. "Now, Edward, fire first--aim his shoulder. Humphrey, pull up." Humphrey stopped pony bull continued advance, seemed puzzled attack, unless dog. As soon bull within sixty yards, Edward fired, animal fell knees, tearing ground horns. "That do," said Jacob; "drive again, Humphrey; look fellow by-and-by. At present better get home, others may come. He is again, he stand-still. I idea he hit hard." The cart drove on, followed heifer, wild herd made appearance, soon gained cottage. "Now, then, shall do?" said Jacob. "Come, Humphrey, ordering this, done well." "Well, Jacob, must drive cart yard, shut gate upon cow, till I ready." "That is easy done, setting Smoker her," replied Jacob; "but, mercy us, there is Alice Edith running out!--the heifer may kill them. Go back, Alice, run quite cottage, shut door till come." Alice Edith hearing this, Edward also crying them, made hasty retreat cottage. Humphrey backed cart paling yard, enable Edward get side it, ready open gate. Smoker set heifer, and, before, soon engaged her attention; gate opened cart drove in, gate closed again, heifer could follow. "Well, Humphrey, next?" "Why, lift calf out, put cow-house. I go cow-house rope slip-knot end it, get upon beam above, drop her horns she is busy calf, she soon let her in. I shall pass end rope outside haul I ready, shall her fast, till secure her properly. When I call Ready, open gate let her in. You jump cart afterward, fear she may run you; I do not think she will, it is calf she wants, either you." As soon Humphrey ready rope, he gave word, gate opened; cow ran immediately, and, hearing her calf bleat, went cow-house, door shut upon her. A minute afterward Humphrey cried haul upon rope, did. "That do," said Humphrey inside; "now make rope fast, may come in." They went found heifer drawn close side cow-house rope round her horns, unable move her head. "Well, Humphrey, that is clever; done?" "First, I will saw tips her horns, she run us, she will not hurt us much. Wait till I go saw." As soon ends her horns sawed off, Humphrey took another piece rope, he fastened securely round her horns, made end fast side building, animal could move little eat crib. "There," said Humphrey, "now time patience must rest. We must coax her handle her, soon shall tame her. At present let us leave her calf. She yard rope, enough her lick her calf, she requires present. To-morrow cut grass her." They went out, shutting cow-house door. "Well, Humphrey, you have beat us all, laugh side now," said Jacob. "'Where there is will, there is way,' that is certain; I assure you, making much hay, gathering much litter, building cow-house, I idea cow elephant; I say deserve great credit way obtaining it." "That he certainly does," replied Edward. "You genius I have, brother. But dinner must ready, Alice done her duty. What think Jacob, shall dinner go look bull?" "Yes, means. He bad eating, I sell I carry cart Lymington. Besides, skin worth money." CHAPTER VI. Alice Edith anxious see cow, especially see calf; Humphrey told must go near till he went them, see it. After dinner over, Jacob Edward took guns, Humphrey put Billy cart followed them. They found bull left him, standing quite still; he tossed his head approached him, carefully, he attempt run them. "It is idea he nearly bled death," said Jacob; "but there is nothing like making sure. Edward, put bullet three inches behind his shoulder, make safe." Edward so, animal fell dead. They went carcass, estimated weigh least fifty stone. "It noble beast," said Edward; "I wonder never thought killing one before?" "They are not game, Edward," replied Jacob. "No, now, Jacob," said Humphrey; "as Edward claim game, I shall claim cattle portion forest. Recollect, more, I mean yet." "Well, Humphrey, I give rights, I any," "And I, mine," added Edward. "Be so. Some day you will see I shall do," replied Humphrey. "Recollect, I sell cattle self-advantage I buy gun, one two things I want." "I agree too, Humphrey," replied Jacob; "and skin beast." The skinning quartering took whole afternoon, Billy heavy laden he drew his cart home. The next day Jacob went Lymington sell bull skin, returned home well satisfied profit he made. He procured, Humphrey requested, milk-pans, small churn, milk-pail proceeds, still money left. Humphrey told he see heifer yet, he thought better not. "She tame to-morrow morning, depend upon it," said he. "But give her nothing eat, calf die?" "Oh no, I think not. I shall starve her, I make her thankful her food she gets it. I shall cut her grass to-morrow morning." We may well say, next morning Humphrey went heifer. At first she tossed about, unruly. He gave her grass, patted her coaxed her long while, till last she allowed touch her gently. Every day fortnight he brought her food, she became quieter every day, till last he went her, she never pushed her horns. The calf became quite tame, heifer perceived calf quiet, she became quiet herself. After fortnight, Humphrey would allow heifer receive thing except hand Alice, animal might know her well; calf month old, Humphrey made first attempt milk her. This resisted first kicking, course ten days she gave her milk. Humphrey let her loose days run yard, still keeping calf cow-house, putting heifer her night, milking her calf allowed suck. After he adventured upon last experiment, turn her yard graze forest. She went away distance, he fearful she would join herd, evening she came back her calf. After he satisfied, turned her every day, trouble her. He would not, however, wean calf till winter time, she shut yard fed hay. He weaned calf, cow calf, trouble mother. Alice soon learned milk her, she became tractable good-tempered. Such commencement dairy cottage. "Jacob," said Humphrey, "when go Lymington again?" "Why, I know. The end August, now, month September, good venison; and, therefore, I see I shall go for." "Well, I wish go, would get something Alice something me." "And Alice wants?" "She wants kitten." "Well, I think I may find that. And want, Humphrey?" "I want dog. Smoker altogether; I want dog myself, bring fashion." "Well, I ought look another dog: although Smoker old, yet one ought two dogs one's gun case accident." "I think too," replied Edward; "see get two puppies, one Humphrey one myself." "Well, I must go Lymington them. I must cross forest, see friends mine I seen long while, I may get right sort puppies there, like Smoker. I will once, I may wait them, even I promise." "May I go you, Jacob?" said Edward. "Why, I would rather not; may ask questions." "And would I rather he would not, he shirk his work here." "Why, do, Humphrey?" "Plenty do, hard work, Edward; acorns fit beating down, want great many bushels pigs. We fatten three, feed rest winter. I get well Alice Edith; lazy, stay us help us." "Humphrey, think nothing pigs farmyard." "And great hunter think thing stag; bird hand worth two bush, opinion; I will make farmyard ever forest." "Humphrey nothing poultry eggs, he, Edward? belong Edith me, Jacob shall take Lymington sell us, get us new clothes Sunday, begin look rather worn--and wonder." "No, dearest, poultry yours, I sell soon please, buy wish money," replied Jacob. "Let Humphrey make money he his pigs." "Yes; butter belongs me, I make it," said Alice. "No no," replied Humphrey; "that is fair; I find cows, get nothing them. We must go halves Alice." "Well, I have objection that," said Alice "because find cows feed them. I made pound butter yesterday, try I could do; it is firm, Jacob. How that?" "I seen women make butter, know how, Alice; next time I you. I suppose wash butter-milk well out, put salt it?" "I put salt it." "But must, butter keep." It arranged Edward stay home assist collecting acorns pigs, Jacob cross forest alone see puppies, he set next morning. He away two days, returned; said he promise two puppies, he chosen them; breed Smoker, fortnight old, could taken mother yet awhile, he arranged call three four months old, able follow across forest. Jacob also said he near hurt stag made him--for season year stags dangerous fierce--but he fired, struck one animal's horns, made turn. "You must careful, Edward, go forest now." "I wish go," replied Edward; "as hunt, use; November shall begin again." "Yes," replied Jacob, "that soon enough. To-morrow I help acorns, day afterward, I spared, I take Alice's poultry Lymington her." "Yes, come back help churn I shall good deal cream." "And do not forget buy kitten, Jacob," said Edith. "What is good kitten?" said Humphrey, busy making bird-cage Edith, finished one Alice; "she steal cream eat birds." "No, she will not; we will shut door fast milk cream are, we will hang cages high Miss Puss will not able get them." "Well, then, kitten useful," said Edward, "for she teach careful." "My coat little worse wear, yours, Edward. We must try not, like Alice, find means pay another." "Humphrey," said Jacob, "I will buy want, trust paying soon can." "That is I want," replied Humphrey. "Then must buy gun new suit clothes first; I have paid them, I shall want tools, nails screws, two three things; I say nothing now. Get gun, I will try forest me--especially I dog." "Well, shall see; perhaps you will like come sometimes learn woodcraft, Edward knows much I now, go himself." "Of course I will, Jacob: I want learn every thing." "Well, there is little money left bag yet, I go Lymington to-morrow. Now I think time bed; tired I am, sleep soundly." Jacob put cart next day forty chickens Alice reared; others kept increase number poultry-yard. They cost little nothing bringing up; quite young, little oatmeal cake, afterward, potatoes left, found themselves, fowls always great range ground go over. Jacob came back sunset, articles. He brought new suit Alice Edith, needles thread, worsted, gave her money left sale chickens, he made purchases. He also bought new suit Edward Humphrey, gun, much approved Humphrey, larger bore carried heavier bullet either Jacob's Edward's; white kitten Alice Edith. There news, Levelers opposed Cromwell, he put troops, Jacob said appeared squabbling fighting other. Time passed; month November came without thing disturb daily employments family forest: one evening, Jacob, returned hunting Edward (the first time since season commenced) told Alice she must she could give good dinner next day, feast. "Why so, Jacob?" "If guess, I will not tell till time comes," replied Jacob. "Well then, Humphrey must help us," replied Alice, "and can. I try, meat, make grand dinner." Alice made preparations, dinner next day piece baked venison, venison stew, pair roast chickens, apple pie--which, them, grand dinner indeed. And well dressed: Jacob taught her cook, degrees she improved upon Jacob's instruction. Humphrey quite clever she was; little Edith useful, she plucked fowls, watched things cooking. "And I will tell you," said Jacob, saying grace, "why I asked feast day. It exactly day twelvemonth I brought cottage. Now know." "I know it, certainly, I dare say right," replied Edward. "And now, children, tell me," said Jacob, "has year passed quickly happily--quite quickly quite happily staying Arnwood?" "Yes, so," replied Humphrey; "for often I know amuse myself, since I days always short." "I agree Humphrey," said Edward. "And I sure I do," replied Alice; "I am always busy always happy, I am never scolded dirtying clothes tearing them, I used be." "And little Edith say?" "I like help Alice, I like play kitten," replied Edith. "Well, children," said Jacob, "depend upon it, happy days pass quickest, case plenty do. Here peace safety; may please God may continue so! We want things world--that is, really want things, although wish sigh many. You health spirits, greatest blessings life. Who would believe, look all, children I brought away Arnwood? You different now. You strong healthy, rosy brown, instead fair delicate. Look sisters, Edward. Do think former friends--do think Martha, care them, would know them?" Edward smiled, said, "Certainly not; especially present dresses." "Nor would, I think, Humphrey known again. You, Edward, always stout boy; and, except grown much, brown, great difference. You would known again, even present forester's dress; I say is, ought thankful Almighty you, instead burned beds, found health, happiness, security, forester's hut; I ought be, am, thankful Heaven, pleased spare life, enable teach present, gain livelihoods I called away. I able far fulfill promise noble father; know heavy load mind every day lessened, I see day able provide yourselves. God bless you, dear children, may live see many returns, happy returns, day;" Jacob much moved he said this, tear seen rolling his furrowed cheek. The second winter came on. Jacob Edward went hunting usually twice a-week; old forester complained stiffness rheumatism, feeling active he used be. Humphrey accompanied Edward perhaps one day week, more, seldom returned without procured venison, Edward knew his business well, longer needed advice Jacob. As winter advanced, Jacob gave going altogether. He went Lymington sell venison procure necessary household, oatmeal flour, principal wants, even journeys fatigued him, evident old man's constitution breaking fast. Humphrey always busy. One evening he making something puzzled all. They asked for, he would tell them. "It is experiment I trying," said he he bending hazel stick. "If answers, shall know: not, I have little trouble nothing. Jacob, I hope forget salt to-morrow go Lymington, pigs ready killing, must salt greatest part pork. After legs shoulders lain long enough salt, I mean try I smoke them, I do, I will smoke bacon. Will not jolly, Alice? Will not like great piece bacon hanging there, get stool cut want, Edward I come home hungry, you have nothing give us eat?" "I shall glad it, I think too, way talk." "I shall, I assure you. Jacob, did not say ash sticks best smoke bacon with?" "Yes, boy: ready, I will tell manage. My poor mother used smoke well chimney." "I think do," said Humphrey, letting his hazel stick spring up, he bent down, "but to-morrow I shall find out." "But for, Humphrey?" said Edith. "Go away, puss, play kitten," replied Humphrey, putting away his tools his materials corner; "I have great deal hands now, I must kill pigs I think thing else." The next day Jacob took venison Lymington, brought back salt articles required. The pigs killed, salted Jacob's directions; his rheumatism allow assist, Humphrey Edward rubbed salt, Alice took pieces pork away tub finished. Humphrey day unknown article he long about. The next morning he went early breakfast he returned, he brought hare his hand, he laid table. "There," said he, "my spring answered, first fruits it. Now I will make more, something way change dinner." They much pleased Humphrey's success, he little proud it. "How find make it?" "Why, I read old book travels Jacob brought home last summer, people catching rabbits hares way like this; I could make exactly, gave idea." We ought told reader Jacob brought home old book two he picked up, given him, occasionally looked Humphrey Edward, then, much find much time reading, although sometimes, evening, take up. When considered young were, practical busy life led, surprising. CHAPTER VII. Humphrey something else. He made several traps, brought rabbits hares almost every day. He also made bird-traps, caught two goldfinches Alice Edith, put cages he made them. But, said, Humphrey something else; he early morning, evening, moon up, he came home late, long gone bed; never knew why, would he tell them. A heavy fall snow took place, Humphrey ever. At last, week snow laid ground, one morning he came hare rabbit his hand, said, "Edward, I caught something larger hare rabbit, must come help me, must take guns. Jacob, I suppose rheumatism bad let come too?" "No; I think I manage. It is damp hurts much. This frosty air good, perhaps. I much better since snow fell. Now, then, let us see caught." "You walk two miles," said Humphrey, went out. "I manage it, Humphrey, lead way." Humphrey went till came close clump large trees, brought pitfall he dug, six feet wide eight feet long, nine feet deep. "There is large trap," said Humphrey, "and see I caught it." They looked pit perceived young bull it. Smoker, him, began bark furiously it. "Now, do? I do not think hurt. Can get out?" said Humphrey. "No, well. If calf, might; heavy, get alive, must kill ward, better shoot once." "So I think," replied Humphrey. "But catch him?" said Edward. "I read book I traps hares," replied Humphrey. "I dug pit covered brambles, put snow top. This thicket herd comes chiefly winter time; large dry, large trees shelter it; I chose spot. I took large bundle hay, put snow pit, strewed small handfuls, cattle must find it, pick up, I knew would glad do, snow ground. And now, see, I succeeded." "Well, Humphrey, beat us, I say," said Edward. "Shall I shoot him?" "Yes, he looking up." Edward shot his ball forehead animal, fell dead: obliged go home pony cart, ropes get animal pit, hard job too; pony helped them, get last. "I easier next time," said Humphrey. "I make windlass soon I can, soon hoist another, like turn bucket water well." "It is nice young meat," said Jacob, skinning bull, "not eighteen months old, I think. Had full-grown one, like shot, must remained was, never could got out." "Yes, Jacob, should, I gone cut pit, would handed bits, could managed whole." They loaded cart skin quarters animal, drove home. "This go far pay gun, Humphrey," said Jacob, "if do not pay more." "I glad it," said Humphrey, "but I hope last I take." "That reminds me, Humphrey, one thing; I think must come back cart carry away entrails beast, remove blood snow, I have observed cattle scared smell sight blood. I found twice seeing come I cut throat stag, soon put noses blood ground, put tails galloped away, bellowing terrible rate. Indeed, I have heard say, murder committed wood, want find body, herd cattle drove serve better even bloodhound." "Thank telling that, Jacob, I never supposed it, I will tell I will also do; I will load cart fern litter, put bottom pit, I could get heifer calf worth taking, may hurt fall." "It must taken long dig pit, Humphrey." "Yes, did, I got deeper work harder, I carry away earth scatter about. I month time I began till finished, I ladder go last, carried baskets earth up, deep throw out." "Nothing like patience perseverance, Humphrey. You have I have." "I am sure he I have, shall ever have, I am afraid," replied Edward. During winter, passed rapidly way circumstances consequence occurred. Old Jacob less confined cottage rheumatism, Edward hunted either occasionally Humphrey. Humphrey fortunate enough take bull cow calf his pitfall, year fifteen months old, rude invention his, way windlass, contrived, assistance Edward, hoist uninjured pit. They put yard, starved till tamed, followed example heifer calf, became quite tame. These important addition stock, may well imagined. The mishap labored was, old Jacob's confinement cottage, which, winter advanced, prevented going Lymington; could not, therefore, sell venison; Humphrey, way experiment, smoked venison hams, he hung others. There another point felt anxiety, was, Jacob could cross forest get puppies promised them, time passed, January, he called them. Edward Humphrey pressed old man hard let one go, answer could obtain "that he would better soon." At last, finding he got worse instead better, he consented Edward go. He gave directions proceed, way he take, description keeper's lodge; cautioned call name Armitage, describe his grandson. Edward promised obey Jacob's directions, next morning he set off, mounted upon White Billy, little money his pocket case he want it. "I wish I going you," said Humphrey, he walked side pony. "I wish were, Humphrey: part, I feel I slave set liberty. I justice old Jacob's kindness good will, acknowledge much indebted him; still housed forest, never seeing speaking one, shut world, suit Edward Beverley. Our father soldier, right good one, I old enough I think even I escape join royal party, broken may accounts is, moment. Deer stalking well, I fly higher game." "I feel do," replied Humphrey: "but recollect, Edward, old man's infirm, would become sisters leave them?" "I know well, Humphrey--I idea leaving them, may sure; I wish relations safety, free act." "Yes, should, Edward; recollect yet men, boys fifteen thirteen much, although may wish much." "It is true I fifteen," replied Edward, "but I strong enough, you. I think I fair cut man's head I would make stagger it, he big buffalo. As young I wars, I know well; I recollect father promising I go soon I fifteen." "What puzzles me," replied Humphrey, "is, fear old Jacob seen Lymington." "Why, fear there?" "I tell you; opinion, fear his imagination. They surely would hurt us (if walked without arms like people) father fought king? That beheaded people true, plotting king's favor, ways opposed Parliament. This I gathered Jacob: I see fear remain quiet. But comes question, Edward, Jacob has, I believe, said one subject he you. Suppose leave forest, would first step would take?" "I should, course, state I was, take possession father's property Arnwood, mine descent." "Exactly; Jacob thinks, he says would ruin, property sequestered, call it, forfeited Parliament, consequence father fought king's side. It longer belongs you, would allowed take it: contrary, would, probability, imprisoned, knows might take place? You see danger." "Did Jacob say you?" "Yes, he did: he told he dare speak subject, fiery; heard property confiscated, would certainly rash act, thing kind would pretense laying hold you; he said he think he would live long, he weaker every day; he hoped his life would spared another year two, he might keep quiet till better times came. He said supposed burned house fired, would give fair opportunity calling impostor treating accordingly, many anxious gift property, would thousands people compassing death. He said making known claiming property would conduct enemies would wish follow, would attended fatal consequences; he said, prove Edward Beverley, must declare I sisters forest him, disclosure would put whole family power bitterest enemies; would become sisters, would impossible say, likely would put charge Puritan family would pleasure ill-treating humiliating daughters man Colonel Beverley." "And he tell this?" "He afraid say thing you; he thought would mad idea injustice would something rash: he said, I pray every night otherwise useless life may spared; for, I die, I know Edward would quit forest." "Never, sisters protection," replied Edward; "were safe, I would to-morrow." "I think, Edward, great truth Jacob says; could good (for would restore property) making seclusion known present, might great deal harm--'bide time' good advice troubled times. I therefore think I wary I you; I still think fear either I going forest, present dresses name Armitage. No one would recognize us; grown tall I, tanned sunburned air exercise, look like Children Forest sons Colonel Beverley." "Humphrey, speak sensibly, I agree you. I quite fiery old man thinks; bosom burns indignation, events I sufficient power conceal feelings necessary; I oppose art art, becomes requisite, which, said, I believe really so. One thing certain, King Charles prisoner, he is, his party dispersed gone abroad, I nothing, make known would injure us. Keep quiet, therefore, I certainly shall, also remain I now, false name; still I must mix people know going on. I willing live forest protect sisters long necessary do; although I reside here, I confined forest altogether." "That is exactly I think too, Edward--what I wish myself; let us hasty even this. And now, I wish pleasant ride; and, Edward, can, procure keepers small shot me; I much wish some." "I forget; good-by, brother." Humphrey returned home attend his farmyard, Edward continued his journey forest. Some estimate character two boys may formed conversation. Edward courageous impetuous hasty his resolves, still open conviction. Brought heir property, he felt, Humphrey could expected do, mortification left pauper, high prospects his early days: his vindictive feelings opposite party therefore keen, his spirit mounted conviction he labored. His disposition naturally warlike, disposition fostered his father he child--still kinder heart generous lad never existed. Humphrey much subdued philosophical temperament, perhaps well calculated lead advise; great prudence united courage, his passive courage rather active one--a courage which, assailed, would defend valiantly, would wary reflective would attack. Humphrey spirit chivalry possessed Edward. He younger son, earn, way, his fortune, he felt his inclinations peace strife. Moreover, Humphrey talents Edward not--a natural talent mechanics, inquisitive research science, far his limited education would permit him. He fitted engineer agriculturist soldier, although doubt he would made brave soldier, become his avocation. For kindness generosity nature he equal his brother, reason angry word never passed them; question his way, give wishes other. We hardly need say, never two brothers attached, mutually respected other. CHAPTER VIII. Edward put pony trot, two hours side New Forest. The directions given Jacob forgotten, noon he found gate keeper's house. Dismounting, hanging bridle pony rail, he walked small garden, neatly kept, but, early year, gay, except crocus snowdrops peeping. He rapped door his knuckles, girl fourteen, neatly dressed, answered summons. "Is Oswald Partridge home, maiden," said Edward. "No, young man, he not. He forest." "When he return?" "Toward evening his time, unless he usually successful." "I come distance find him," replied Edward; "and would vex return without seeing him. Has he wife, one I could speak to?" "He wife; I willing deliver message." "I come dogs he promised Jacob Armitage, relation; old man unwell, time, come them, he sent me." "There dogs, young old, large small, kennels; far I know, more." "I fear, then, I must wait till his return," replied Edward. "I speak father," replied young girl, "if wait one moment." In minute two girl returned, saying her father begged he would walk in, he would speak him. Edward bowed, followed young girl, led way room, seated man dressed fashion Roundheads day. His steeple-crowned hat lay chair, his sword beneath it. He sitting table covered papers. "Here youth, father," said girl; said this, she crossed room took seat side fire. The man, rather say gentleman--for he appearance one, notwithstanding somber peculiar dress he wore, continued read letter he opened; Edward, feared prisoner Roundhead, he expected meet keeper, irritated neglect shown toward party. Forgetting he was, his assertion, Edward Beverley, relative one Jacob Armitage, he colored anger he stood door. Fortunately time took party read letter gave Edward also time recollecting disguise he appeared; color subsided his cheeks, he remained silence, occasionally meeting look little girl, who, eyes met, immediately withdrew her glance. "What business, young man?" last said gentleman table. "I came, sir, private business keeper, Oswald Partridge, obtain two young hounds, he promised grandfather, Jacob Armitage." "Armitage!" said party, referring list table; "Armitage--Jacob--yes--I see he one verderers. Why he call upon me?" "For reason he call upon you, sir?" replied Edward. "Simply, young man, New Forest is, Parliament, committed charge. Notice given employed come here, might permitted remain, discharged, I may deem advisable." "Jacob Armitage heard nothing this, sir," replied Edward. "He keeper, appointed king; two three years his allowances never paid, he lived his cottage, left his father, his property." "And pray, may I ask, young man, live Jacob Armitage?" "I done year." "And relation received pay allowances, state, pray means he maintained himself?" "How keepers maintained themselves?" replied Edward. "Do put questions me, sir," replied gentleman; "but pleased reply mine. What means subsistence Jacob Armitage?" "If think he means subsistence, sir, mistaken," replied Edward. "We land own, cultivate; pony cart; pigs cows." "And sufficient?" "Had patriarchs more?" replied Edward. "You pithy reply, young man; I know something Jacob Armitage, know," continued he, putting his finger close writing opposite name list, "with he associated, he served. Now allow put one question. You come, say, two young hounds. Are services required pigs cows, uses put." "We good dog forest," replied Edward; "but wished others case lose him." "As good dog forest--good what?" "For hunting." "Then acknowledge hunt?" "I acknowledge nothing Jacob Armitage; he may answer himself," replied Edward; "but allow assure he killed venison, one blame him." "Perhaps explain why?" "Nothing easy. Jacob Armitage served King Charles, employed verderer forest, paid his wages. Those done rebelled king, took his authority him, means paying he employed. They still servants king, dismissed; and, means support, considered good master would happy support killing, subsistence, venison could longer preserve without eating themselves." "Then admit Jacob Armitage killed deer forest?" "I admit nothing Jacob Armitage." "You admit killed yourself." "I shall answer question, sir; first place, I criminate myself; and, next, I must know authority right inquire." "Young man," replied other, severe tone, "if wish know authority, malapert (at remark Edward started, yet, recollecting himself, he compressed his lips stood still), commission, appointing agent Parliament take charge superintend New Forest, power appoint dismiss I please. I presume must take word it, read write." Edward stepped table, quietly took paper read it. "You stated correct, sir," said he, laying down; "and date is, I perceive, 20th last month--December. It is, therefore, eighteen days old." "And inference would draw that, young man?" replied gentleman, looking astonishment. "Simply this, sir--that Jacob Armitage laid rheumatism three months, time he certainly killed venison. Now, sir, Parliament took forest hands, undoubtedly belonged his majesty, now; therefore Jacob Armitage, whatever slaughter he may committed, is, present, answerable his sovereign, King Charles." "It easy perceive school brought up, young man, even evidence paper forefather served Cavalier, Colonel Beverley, brought his way thinking." "Sir, base dog bites hand feeds him," replied Edward, warmth. "Jacob Armitage, his father him, retainers family Colonel Beverley; indebted situation held forest; indebted every thing; revere his name, uphold he fell, I do." "Young man, speak advisedly, events speak gratefully; neither I word disrespect offer memory Colonel Beverley, gallant man, true he espoused, although holy one; but, position, I not, justice I serve, give places emolument been, still are, I may judge expressions, adverse present government." "Sir," replied Edward, "your language, respect Colonel Beverley, made feel respect you, I confess I first; say just, I think harm Jacob Armitage, as, first place, I know he would serve you; and, next, he old infirm hold situation; neither he occasion it, his cottage land his own, remove him." "He title, I presume," replied gentleman. "He title given his grandfather, long King Charles born, I presume Parliament intend invalidate acts former kings." "May I inquire relation Jacob Armitage?" "I believe I said before, his grandson." "You live him?" "I do." "And old man dies, inherit his property?" Edward smiled, looking young girl, said: "Now, I ask you, maiden, father presume upon his office." The young girl laughed, said: "He authority." "Not me, certainly, grandfather, he dismissed him." "Were brought cottage, young man?" "No, sir, I brought Arnwood. I playmate children Colonel Beverley." "Educated them?" "Yes, far willfulness would permit, chaplain always ready give instruction." "Where Arnwood burned down?" "I cottage time," replied Edward, grinding his teeth looking wildly. "Nay, nay, I forgive expression feeling part, young man, dreadful disgraceful deed brought memory. It stain never effaced--a deed diabolical, thought would call vengeance Heaven. If prayers could avert, avert it, wanting side." Edward remained silent: admission part Roundhead prevented explosion his part. He felt bad he imagined. After long pause, he said: "When I came here, sir, seek Oswald Partridge, obtain hounds he promised us; I presume journey useless." "Why so?" "Because control forest, permit dogs chase given away employed powers govern." "You judged correctly, far duty prevent it; promise made previous date commission, I presume," said he, smiling, "you think I right interfere, _ex post facto_ case I do: I shall not, therefore, interfere, I must point laws still relative take deer forest stealth--you understand me?" "Yes, sir, I do; offended, I give candid reply." "Speak, then." "I consider deer forest belong King Charles, lawful sovereign, I authority him. I hold answerable alone deer I may kill, I feel sure his permission full forgiveness I may do." "That may opinion, good sir, opinion ruling powers; caught, punished, me, pursuance authority vested me." "Well, sir, so, it. You dismissed Armitages account upholding king, not, therefore, surprised uphold ever. Nor surprised dismissed verderer becomes poacher." "Nor surprised, poacher caught, he incurs penalty," replied Roundhead. "So there is end argument. If go kitchen find wherewithal refresh outward man, wish remain till Oswald Partridge comes home, welcome." Edward, felt indignant dismissed kitchen, nodded his head smiled upon little girl, left room. "Well," thought he, he went along passage, "I came two puppies, I found Roundhead. I do not know is, I angry I thought I be. That little girl nice smile--she quite handsome she smiled. Oh, kitchen, which," thought he, "the Lord Arnwood dismissed Covenanter Roundhead, probably tradesman outlaw, served because. Well, so; Humphrey says, 'I will bide time.' But one here, I will try stable White Billy, tired, I presume, gate." Edward returned way he came, went front door garden pony made fast, led away search stable. He found one behind house, filling rack hay, returned house seated porch door led back premises, keeper's house large commodious. Edward deep thought, he roused little girl, daughter newly-appointed intendant forest, said: "I afraid, young sir, sorry welcome kitchen, one receive you. I aware Phoebe gone out. If come me, I may perhaps find refreshment." "Thanks, maiden, kind considerate avowed poacher," replied Edward. "Oh, poach, I am sure; do, I will beg I can," replied girl, laughing. Edward followed her kitchen, she soon produced cold fowl venison pasty, she placed table; she went returned jug ale. "There," said she, putting table, "that I find." "Your father's name Heatherstone, I believe. It warrant." "Yes, is." "And yours?" "The father's, I presume." "Yes, baptismal name?" "You ask strange questions, young sir; still I answer that: baptismal name Patience." "I thank condescension," replied Edward "You live here?" "For present, good sir; I leave you." "That is nice little girl, thought Edward, although she daughter Roundhead; she calls 'Sir.' I not, therefore, look like Jacob's grandson, must careful." Edward set good appetite viands placed him, finished hearty meal Patience Heatherstone came said: "Oswald Partridge coming home." "I thank you, maiden," replied Edward. "May I ask question you? Where king now?" "I heard he resides Hurst Castle," replied girl; "but," added she low tone, "all attempts see would useless hurt made attempt." Having said this, she left room. CHAPTER IX. Edward, finished his meal, good pull jug ale, liquor he tasted long while, rose table went back door, found Oswald Partridge. He accosted him, stating reason his coming him. "I know Jacob grandson: indeed I never knew he son. Have living long?" "More year," replied Edward; "before that, I household Arnwood." "Then king's side, I presume?" replied Oswald. "To death," replied Edward, "when time comes." "And I also; may suppose, never would I give hound one not. But better go kennels. Dogs may hear, cannot repeat." "I little thought met one I came," said Edward; "and I tell passed new intendant." Edward related conversation. "You bold," said Oswald; "but perhaps better. I retain situation, two others; many new hands coming rangers. I know nothing them, little fitted places, rail king day long, which, I suppose, chief merit eyes appoint them. However, one thing certain, fellows stalk deer themselves, prevent others; must alert, punishment severe." "I fear not; difficulty is, shall able find sale venison now," replied Edward. "Oh never fear that; I give names take venison hands without risk part, except killing it. They meet park, lay ready money, take away. I do not know, I idea, new intendant, may call him, severe he pretends be. Indeed, his permitting say he did, his words relative colonel, convince I right opinion I formed." "Do know he is?" "Not much him, he great friend General Cromwell, say done good service Parliamentary because; shall meet again, forest free events." "If come here," continued Oswald, "do carry gun--and see watched home. There dogs grandfather. Why, old must be, Jacob sixty thereabout?" "I fifteen, past, nevertheless." "I put eighteen nineteen least. You well grown indeed age. Well, nothing like forest life turn boy man! Can stalk deer?" "I seldom go without bringing one down." "Indeed! That Jacob master his craft, certain; young learned soon. Can tell slot brocket stag?" "Yes, slot brocket doe." "Better still. We must go together; besides, I must know old man's cottage (for I exactly), first place, I may want come you, next, I may put others false scent. Do know clump large oaks call Clump Royal?" "Yes, I do." "Will meet day to-morrow, early dawn?" "If I live well." "That is enough. Take dogs leashes, go away now." "Many thanks; I must leave pony, he stable." The keeper nodded adieu Edward, left go stable pony. Edward saddled White Billy, rode away across forest dogs trotting pony's heels. Edward much reflect upon he rode back cottage. He felt his position one difficulty before. That old Jacob Armitage would last much longer, he convinced; even poor old man shrunk away skeleton pain disease. That livelihood procured forest would attended peril, order restored, forest longer neglected, certain; he rejoiced Humphrey had, his assiduity intelligence, made farm profitable promised be. Indeed he felt that, necessary, could live upon proceeds farm, run risk imprisonment stalking deer. But he told intendant he considered game king's property, he resolved he would events run risk, although he would longer permit Humphrey do. "If thing happens me," thought Edward, "Humphrey still cottage take care sisters; I obliged fly country, suit well feelings, I offer services still support king." With thoughts many others he amused until, late evening, he arrived cottage. He found bed except Humphrey, waited him, he narrated passed. Humphrey said little reply; he wished think he gave opinion. He told Edward Jacob ill whole day, requested Alice read Bible evening. The next morning Edward went Jacob, last ten days altogether kept his bed, gave detail happened keeper's lodge. "You bold prudent, Edward," replied Jacob; "but I could expect spoken otherwise. You proud manly tell lie, I glad so. As upholding king, although he prisoner hands, blame punish that, long weapons hands; taken forest jurisdiction, must careful, ruling powers present, must obeyed, forfeit must paid. Still I ask promise that; I point sisters suffer imprudence part; sakes careful. I say this, Edward, I feel days numbered, short time I shall called away. You load shoulders latterly mine. I fear result prudent; months past, I burden you, proved Humphrey find living sisters; fortunate, forest laws put force, made farm profitable. If I might advise, let hunting forest confined wild cattle; game, forest laws extend them, meat valuable venison--that say, sell dear, it; stick farm much can; see, Edward, look like low-born forester, ought so; quiet keep better. As Oswald Partridge, may trust him; I know well; he prove friend sake, soon he hears I dead. Leave now--I talk evening. Send Alice me, dear boy." Edward much distressed perceive change taken place old Jacob. He evidently much worse; Edward idea much worse he was. Edward assisted Humphrey farm, evening went Jacob, told arrangement he made meet Oswald Partridge following morning. "Go, boy," said Jacob; "be intimate can, make friend him--nay, necessary, may tell are; I think telling myself, might important one day evidence. I think better bring to-morrow night, Edward; tell I dying, wish speak I go. Alice read Bible now, I talk another time." Early next morning Edward set appointed rendezvous Oswald Partridge. The Clump Royal, called, peculiar size beauty oaks, seven miles cottage; hour time indicated, Edward, his gun his hand, Smoker lying beside him, leaning one monarchs forest. He wait long. Oswald Partridge, similarly provided, made his appearance, Edward advanced meet him. "Welcome, Oswald," said Edward. "And welcome also, fine lad," replied Oswald. "I hard questioned since parted--first Roundhead Heatherstone, plied manner ways find whether assert, grandson Jacob--or person. I really believe he fancies Duke York--but he, could get I knew. I told grandfather's cottage his property, grant his forefathers; brought Arnwood, joined grandfather death colonel, murderous burning house within his party. But pretty little daughter curious still. She cross-questioned every way her father present, last begged favor tell take deer, her father strict his duty, and, caught, would imprisoned." "Many thanks her her caution, I hope take one to-day, nevertheless," replied Edward; "a hart royal meat Roundheads, although king's servants may feast them." "That is truly said. Well, I must see woodcraft. You shall leader chase." "Think harbor stag here?" "Yes, month, doubt." "Let us walk on," said Edward. "The wind fresh eastern quarter; face it, please--or, rather, keep blowing right cheek present." "It Is well," replied Oswald; walked half hour. "This slot doe," said Edward, low voice, pointing marks; "yonder thicket likely harbor stag." They proceeded, Edward pointed Oswald slot stag thicket. They walked round, found marks animal left his lair. "He here," whispered Edward; Oswald made sign Edward enter thicket, he walked side. Edward entered thicket cautiously. In center he perceived, trees, small cleared spot, covered high fern, felt certain stag lying there. He forced his way his knees till he better view place, cocked his gun. The noise induced stag move his antlers, discover his lair. Edward could perceive eye animal heath; he waited till beast settled again, took steady aim, fired. At report gun another stag sprung burst away. Oswald fired wounded it, animal made off, followed dogs. Edward, hardly knew whether he missed not, felt almost certain he not, hastened thicket join chase; and, he passed fern patch, perceived his quarry lay dead. He followed chase, and, fleet foot, soon came Oswald, passed without speaking. The stag made swampy ground, finally took water beyond it, stood bay. Edward waited Oswald, came him. "He soiled," said Edward, "and may go kill him." Oswald, eager chase, hastened dogs stag water, put bullet animal's head. Edward went him, assisted drag stag water, Oswald cut throat, proceeded perform usual offices. "How happen miss him?" said Oswald; "for shots." "Because I never fired him," said Edward; "my quarry lies dead fern--and fine fellow he is." "This warrantable stag," said Oswald. "Yes, mine hart royal, see go back." As soon Oswald done his work, he hung quarters animal oak-tree, went back Edward. "Where hit him, Edward?" said Oswald, walked along. "I could see his eye fern, I must hit thereabouts." On arrival spot, Oswald found Edward put ball right eye stag. "Well," said he, "you made suppose knew something craft, I believe apt thought be. I confess master, far I see, branches craft. This indeed hart royal. Twenty-five antlers, I live! Come, knife, let us finish; go cottage, time lose. It dark half hour." They hung quarters stag before, set Jacob's cottage, Edward proposing Oswald take cart pony carry meat home next morning, he would accompany bring back. "That capitally," said Oswald; "and are, I recollect right, I hope something eat." "No fear that--Alice prepared us," replied Edward. Their dinner ready them, Oswald praised cooking. He much surprised see Jacob four grandchildren. After dinner, he went Jacob's room, remained hour. During conference, Jacob confided Oswald four children sons daughters Colonel Beverley, supposed burned firing Arnwood. Oswald came out, much surprised well pleased information, confidence reposed him. He saluted Edward Humphrey respectfully, said, "I aware I company, sir, may well imagine; knowledge made heart glad." "Nay, Oswald," replied Edward, "remember I still Edward Armitage, grandchildren old Jacob." "Certainly, sir, I will, sake, forget supposed case. I assure you, I think fortunate Jacob confided secret me, may power useful. I little thought I ever dinner cooked daughter Colonel Beverley." They entered long conversation, Oswald expressed his opinion old man sinking fast, would last three four days. Oswald bed made floor room Edward Humphrey slept; next morning set off, early hour, pony cart, loaded venison, took across forest keeper's lodge. It late arrived, Edward consented pass night there, return home following morning. Oswald went sitting-room speak intendant forest, leaving Edward kitchen Phoebe, maid-servant. He told intendant he brought home fine venison, wished his orders it. He also stated he assisted Edward Armitage, brought venison home his cart, kitchen, he would obliged pass night there; and, questioned, he lavish his praises Edward's skill knowledge woodcraft, he declared superior his own. "It proves young man much practice, events," replied Mr. Heatherstone, smiling. "He living king's expense, he must follow cost Parliament. It would well take young man ranger could; although he opposed us, yet, he took service, he would faithful, I sure. You propose him, Oswald. The hunches hart royal must sent General Cromwell to-morrow: remainder give directions for, soon I made mind dispose it." Oswald left room, came back Edward. "General Cromwell hunches stag," said he Edward, smiling: "and intendant proposes take service one rangers." "I thank you," replied Edward, "but I have fancy find venison General Cromwell his Roundheads; so, may tell intendant, many thanks his good-will toward me, nevertheless." "I thought much, man meant kindly, I really think. Now, Phoebe, give us eat, hungry?" "You shall served directly," replied Phoebe. "I steaks fire." "And must find bed young friend here." "I none house, plenty good straw stables." "That do," replied Edward; "I am particular." "I suppose not. Why be?" replied Phoebe, rather old rather cross. "If mount ladder see wall, find good bed top it." Oswald remonstrate, Edward held his finger said. As soon finished supper, Phoebe proposed go bed. It late, she would sit longer. Edward rose went out, followed Oswald, given keeper's house intendant his daughter, slept cottage one rangers, quarter mile off. After conversation, shook hands parted, Edward intended returning early next morning, anxious old Jacob. Edward went ladder loft. There door shut wind, blew piercingly cold time he found chilled he could sleep. He rose see he could find protection wind getting corner; although Phoebe told plenty straw, proved little indeed loft, barely enough lie upon. Edward, time, descended ladder walk yard, exercise he might recover use his limbs. At last, turning fro, he cast his eyes window bedroom kitchen, he perceived light still burning. He thought Phoebe, maid, going bed; gracious feelings toward her deprived his night's rest, he wishing she might toothache something else keep her awake, suddenly white window curtain he perceived broad light room--it increased every moment--and he saw figure female rush past it, attempt open window--the drawing curtains showed room fire. A moment's thought, he ran ladder he ascended loft, placed window. The flames less bright, he could see female window lie went ladder. He ascended quickly, burst open casement--the smoke poured volumes neatly suffocated him, he went in; soon he inside, he stumbled body person attempted open window, fallen senseless. As he raised body, fire, smothered want air windows doors closed, burst out, he scorched he could get ladder again, body his arms; he succeeded getting safe. Perceiving clothes fire, he held till extinguished, first time discovered he brought daughter intendant forest. There time lost, Edward carried her stable left her there, still insensible, upon straw, spare stall, he hastened alarm house. The watering-butt horses outside stable; Edward caught pail, filled it, hastening ladder, threw room, descended more. By time Edward's continual calls "Fire! fire!" aroused people house, also cottages adjacent. Mr. Heatherstone came half dressed, horror his countenance. Phoebe followed screaming, people hastened cottages. "Save her! daughter room!" exclaimed Mr. Heatherstone. "Oh, save her, let so!" cried poor man, agony; fire burst window force, attempt would vain. "Oswald," cried Edward him, "let people pass water fast possible. They good looking on." Oswald set men work, Edward supplied water fast fire began diminish. The window approachable, buckets enabled put one foot room, every moment flames smoke decreased. Meanwhile would impossible describe agony intendant, would rushed ladder flames, he held men. "My daughter! child!--burned--burned death!" exclaimed he, clasping his hands. At moment voice crowd called out, "There four burned Arnwood!" "God Heaven!" exclaimed Mr. Heatherstone, falling swoon, state he carried neighboring cottage. Meanwhile supply water enabled Edward put fire altogether: furniture room burned, fire extended farther; Edward satisfied danger, he descended ladder, left others see safe. He called Oswald him, desired he would accompany stable. "Oh, sir," replied Oswald, "this dreadful! sweet young lady too." "She safe well," replied Edward, "I think so, least. I brought her ladder, put her stable I attempted put fire. See, she is; she recovered yet her swoon. Bring water. She breathes! thank God! There, do, Oswald, she recovering. Now let us cover her cloak, carry her cottage. We recover her there." Oswald folded still unconscious girl his cloak, earned her away his arms, followed Edward. As soon arrived cottage, inmates busy keeper's lodge, put her bed, soon restored her consciousness. "Where father?" cried Patience, soon she sufficiently recovered. "He safe well, miss," replied Oswald. "Is house burned down?" "No. The fire again." "Who saved me? tell me." "Young Armitage, miss." "Who he? oh, I recollect now; I must go father. Where he?" "In cottage, miss." Patience attempted stand, found she much exhausted, she fell back bed. "I cannot stand," said she. "Bring father me." "I will, miss," replied Oswald. "Will stay here, Edward?" "Yes," replied Edward. He went cottage door, remained Oswald went Mr. Heatherstone. Oswald found sensible, deep distress, may imagined. "The fire out, sir," said Oswald. "I care that. My poor, poor child!" "Your child safe, sir," replied Oswald. "Safe, say?" cried Mr. Heatherstone, starting up. "Safe! where'?" "In cottage. She sent you." Mr. Heatherstone rushed out, passed Edward, standing door cottage, his daughter's arms. Oswald came Edward, detailed way he saved girl. "Had ill-nature woman Phoebe, sending sleep straw, would burned," observed Edward. "She gave opportunity rewarding good evil," observed Oswald. "Yes, I burned much arm," said Edward. "Have thing good it?" "Yes, I think I have: wait moment." Oswald went cottage returned salve, he dressed Edward's arm, proved severely burned. "How grateful intendant ought be--and be, I doubt!" observed Oswald. "And reason I shall saddle pony ride home fast I can; and, hear, Oswald, show I live." "I hardly know I refuse him, he requires it." "But must not. He offering situation forest, way showing his gratitude, I accept none. I objection save his daughter, I would save daughter worst enemy, worst enemy himself, dreadful death; I want thanks offers service. I accept nothing Roundhead; venison forest, belongs king, I shall help whenever I think proper. Good-by, Oswald, call see us time?" "I week out, depend upon it," replied Oswald. Edward asked Oswald saddle his pony him, his arm prevented himself, and, soon done, he rode away cottage. Edward rode fast, he anxious get home ascertain state poor old Jacob; and, moreover, his burned arm painful. He met Humphrey mile cottage, told he think old man could last many hours, he anxious see him. As pony quite tired fast pace Edward ridden, Edward pulled walk, went along acquainted Humphrey passed. "Is arm painful?" "Yes, is, indeed," replied Edward; "but cannot helped." "No, course not, may made easy. I know good; I recollect, Benjamin burned his hand Arnwood, applied it, gave great relief." "Yes, likely; I aware drugs medicine cottage. But are: take Billy stable, I go old Jacob? "Thank God come, Edward," said old forester, "for I anxious see I die; something tells I short time remain here." "Why say so! Do feel ill?" "No, ill; I feel I sinking fast. Recollect I old man, Edward." "Not old, Jacob; Oswald said sixty years old." "Oswald knows nothing it. I past seventy-six, Edward; know, Edward, Bible says days man threescore years ten; I beyond mark. And now, Edward, I words say. Be careful--if sake, least little sisters'. You young, strong powerful years, better protect I could. I see darker days yet coming--but His will, shall doubt right? I pray make birth lineage known yet--it good, may harm--and persuaded live cottage, live farm, support all, better. Do get trouble venison, claim own. You find money bag chest, sufficient buy want long while--but take care it; saying may require it. And now, Edward, call brother sisters me, I may bid farewell. I am, are, sinful, I trust mercy God Jesus Christ. Edward, I done duty toward you, well I able; promise one thing--that read Bible prayers every morning evening, I always done, I gone; promise that, Edward." "I promise shall done, Jacob," replied Edward, "and I forget advice." "God bless you, Edward. Now call children." Edward summoned his sisters Humphrey. "Humphrey, good boy," said Jacob, "recollect, midst life death; security young old. You brother may cut youth; one may taken, left. Recollect, sisters depend upon you, therefore rash: I fear run much risk wild cattle, always scheming taking them. Be careful, Humphrey, ill spared. Hold farm is: support all. My dear Alice Edith, I dying; soon I shall laid brothers grave. Be good children, look brothers every thing. And kiss me, Alice; great comfort me, read Bible I could longer read myself. May death-bed well attended mine been, may live happily, die death Christian! Good-by, may God bless you. Bless you, Edith; may grow good innocent now. Farewell, Humphrey--farewell, Edward--my eyes dim--pray me, children. O God mercy, pardon many sins, receive soul, Jesus Christ. Amen, Amen." These last words spoken old forester. The children, kneeling side bed, praying he requested, rose up, found he dead. They wept bitterly, dearly loved good old man. Alice remained sobbing Edward's arms, Edith Humphrey's, long brothers could console them. Humphrey last said Alice, "You hurt poor Edward's arm--you do not know painful is! Come, dears, let us go room, get something take pain away." These requests diverted attention, time roused fresh sympathy little girls--they went sitting-room. Humphrey gave his sisters potatoes scrape upon piece linen, he took Edward's coat, turned his shirt sleeves. The scraped potatoes laid burn, Edward said gave great relief. Some scraped little girls, could not, however, repress occasional sobs. Humphrey told Edward nothing eat, must get supper. This occupied time; supper ready, sat it. They went bed early, Edward read chapter Bible, prayers, old Jacob always done; caused tears flow afresh. "Come, Alice, dear, Edith must go bed," said Humphrey. The little girls threw brothers' arms; wept time, Alice raised herself, taking Edith hand, led her away her bedroom. CHAPTER X. "Humphrey," said Edward, "the sooner better. As long poor Jacob's body remains cottage nothing distress poor girls." "I agree you," replied Humphrey; "where shall bury him?" "Under great oak-tree, back cottage," replied Edward. "One day old man said me, he like buried one oaks forest." "Well then, I go dig his grave to-night," replied Humphrey; "the moon bright, I shall finished morning." "I sorry I help you, Humphrey." "I sorry hurt; I want help, Edward. If lie little, perhaps able sleep. Let us change potato poultice go on." Humphrey put fresh dressing Edward's arm; Edward, much exhausted, lay his clothes bed. Humphrey went out, found his tools, set his task--he worked hard, and, morning, finished. He went in, took his place bed, side Edward, sound sleep. At daylight Humphrey rose, waked Edward. "All ready, Edward; I fear must help put poor Jacob cart: think can?" "Oh, yes; arm much easier, I feel different I last night. If go get cart, I see I mean time." When Humphrey returned, he found Edward selected sheet wind body in, could till Humphrey came help him. They wrapped round body, carried cottage, put cart. "Now, Edward, shall call sisters?" "No, yet; let us body laid grave first, call them." They dragged body cart grave, laid it, returned back put pony stable again. "Are prayers proper reading dead?" said Humphrey. "I believe are, Bible, must read portion Bible," said Edward. "Yes, I think one Psalms would right read, Edward," said Humphrey, turning leaves; "here is, ninetieth, recollect says, 'that days man threescore years ten.'" "Yes," replied Edward, "and read one also, 146th." "Are sisters risen, think?" "I sure are," replied Humphrey, "and I go them." Humphrey went door, said, "Alice--Alice Edith--come immediately." They ready dressed. Edward took Bible his arm, Alice hand. Humphrey led Edith arrived grave, two little girls saw covered body Jacob lying it. "Kneel down," said Edward, opening Bible. And knelt grave. Edward read two Psalms, closed book. The little girls took one last look body, turned away weeping cottage. Edward Humphrey filled grave, followed sisters home. "I am glad it is over," said Humphrey, wiping his eyes. "Poor old Jacob! I will put paling round his grave." "Come in, Humphrey," said Edward. Edward sat upon old Jacob's chair, took Alice Edith him. Putting his arm round each, he said-- "Alice Edith, dear little sisters, lost good friend, one whose memory grateful. He saved us perishing flames burned father's house, protected us ever since. He gone, pleased God summon him, must bow Heaven; are, brother sisters, orphans, one look protection Heaven. Here away rest world, living one another. What, then, must do? We must love one another dearly, help one another. I part, life spared, Humphrey, dear sisters. I answer all. Now use lament--we must work, work cheerfully; pray every morning every night God bless endeavors enable us provide ourselves, live peace safety. Kiss me, dear Alice Edith, kiss Humphrey, kiss one another. Let kisses seals bond; let us put trust Him father widow orphan. And let us pray." Edward children repeated Lord's Prayer, rose up. They went respective employments, labor day soon made composed, although then, many days afterward, occasionally smile seen upon lips. Thus passed week, time Edward's arm far well gave pain, he able assist Humphrey work farm. The snow disappeared, spring, although checked time, made rapid advances. Constant occupation, return fine weather, effect returning serenity minds; Humphrey preparing paling fix round grave old Jacob, Alice Edith collected wild violets peeped forth sheltered spots, planted roots grave. Edward also procured early flowers he could collect, assisted his sisters task; thus, planting it, putting paling, grave old man became constant work-ground; labor done, would still remain talk his worth. The Sunday following burial, weather fine warm, Edward proposed read usual service, selected old Jacob, grave, cottage, formerly; continued afterward do, whenever weather would permit: thus old Jacob's resting-place become church, overpower feelings love devotion gave efficacy prayer. As soon paling finished, Humphrey put board oak-tree, simple words carved it, "Jacob Armitage." Edward had, every day, expected Oswald Partridge would called upon him, he promised do, week out; Oswald made his appearance, much Edward's surprise. A month passed away; Edward's arm quite well, still Oswald came not. One morning, Humphrey Edward conversing upon many points--the principal upon Edward going Lymington, want flour meal, Edward thought old Jacob told relative money he would find his chest. He went Jacob's room opened chest, bottom which, clothes, he found leather bag, he brought Humphrey; opening it, much surprised find sixty gold pieces, besides great deal silver coin. "Surely great sum money," observed Humphrey. "I do not know price things; appears me, ought last us long while." "I think too," replied Edward. "I wish Oswald Partridge would come, I want ask many questions. I do not know price flour, anything else purchase, I know I ought paid venison. I do not like go Lymington till I see reason. If he come soon, I shall ride see matter." Edward replaced money chest, he Humphrey went farmyard go work. It six weeks death old Jacob Oswald Partridge made his appearance. "How old man, sir?" his first question. "He buried days left," replied Edward. "I expected much," said forester. "Peace him--he good man. And arm?" "Nearly well," replied Edward. "Now sit down, Oswald, I great deal say you; first, let ask detained coming according promise?" "Simply, words--murder." "Murder!" exclaimed Edward. "Yes, deliberate murder, sir; short, beheaded King Charles, sovereign." "Have dared it?" "They have," replied Oswald. "We forest know little going on; I saw last, I heard he London, tried." "Tried!" exclaimed Edward. "How could try king? laws country, man must tried his equals; his equals?" "Majesty becomes naught, I suppose," replied Oswald; "but still I say. Two days left, intendant hastened London, and, I understood, he strongly opposed deed, he could prevent it; use. When he left, he gave strict injunctions go away cottage hour, his daughter left alone; I promised, I could come you; but, nevertheless, Patience received letters him, told I tell you." "You dined, Oswald?" said Edward. "No, I not." "Alice, dear, get dinner, you? And Oswald, dine, excuse I leave while. Your intelligence astounded I listen nothing else till I little commune subdue feelings." Edward indeed state mind required calming down. He quitted cottage walked distance forest, deep thought. "Murdered last!" exclaimed he. "Yes, well may called murder, one save him--not blow struck his defense--not arm raised. How much gallant blood she would vain! Spirit fathers, didst thou leave none thy mettle thy honour behind thee; England become craven? Well, time come, I longer hope fight king, events I fight murdered him." Such Edward's thoughts he wandered forest, hour elapsed his impetuous blood could return usual flow; last, his mind partially resumed wonted calmness, he returned cottage listened details Oswald gave he heard. When Oswald finished, Edward asked whether intendant returned. "Yes, I here," replied Oswald. "He came back yesterday, looking disconsolate grave, I hear he returns London days. Indeed, he told himself, I requested permission come see grandfather. He said I might go, must return soon, he must go back London. I believe, Miss Patience told me, I seen myself, he sincerely amazed vexed taken place; so, indeed, many more, who, although opposed king's method government, never idea things turned done. I message you, is, he begs come see him, he may thank preservation his child." "I take his thanks you, Oswald: well he gave person." "Yes, perhaps so; I another message another party, is--the young lady herself. She desires tell she never happy till she seen you, thanked courage kindness; right put her obligation, give her opportunity expressing she feels. Now, Mr. Edward, I certain she earnest she says, she made promise I would persuade come. I could refuse her, she dear little creature; her father go London days, may ride see her without fear affronted offers he may make you." "Well," replied Edward, "I great objection see her again, she kind me; say intendant there, I perhaps may come. But I must talk matters." Edward put many questions Oswald relative value various articles, best method disposing his venison. Oswald answered his questions, Edward took notes directions paper. Oswald remained two days, bade farewell, exacting promise Edward he would come ranger's cottage soon he could. "Should intendant come back he expected I come let know; I think, I heard say he expected least month London." Edward promised Oswald see less ten days, Oswald set his journey. "Humphrey," said Edward, soon Oswald gone, "I made mind go Lymington to-morrow We must flour, many articles, Alice says she longer without." "Why go, Edward?" replied Humphrey. "No, time," replied Edward. "I find many things many people, I rather go myself; besides, I allow sisters left alone. I consider danger, I admit; thing happen them, I never forgive myself. Still, necessary go Lymington time another, may know purchase sell, required. What I propose is, I ask Oswald come stay couple days. We leave charge sisters, go Lymington together." "You right, Edward, best plan." As Humphrey made remark, Oswald re-entered cottage. "I tell I returned, Mr. Edward," said Oswald. "It consequence whether I return to-morrow. It early, intend going Lymington, occurred I better go you. I show want, much better going yourself." "Thank you, Oswald, I much obliged you," said Edward. "Humphrey, get cart immediately, shall late. Will get it, Humphrey, I must go money, speak Alice." Humphrey went immediately put pony cart, Edward said, "Oswald, must call Mr. Edward, even alone: calling people, and, therefore, recollect future, must plain Edward." "Since wish it, certainly," replied Oswald; "indeed would better, slip tongue people might create suspicion." The pony cart soon door, Edward received instructions Alice, set Lymington, accompanied Oswald. CHAPTER XI. "Would found way Lymington?" said Oswald, pony trotted along. "Yes; I think so," replied Edward; "but I must first gone Arnwood. Indeed, I alone I done so; made much shorter cut." "I think would liked seen ruins Arnwood," replied Oswald. "Not day passes without thinking them," replied Edward. "I like see them. I like see one taken possession property, say confiscated." "I heard be, yet," said Oswald; "but shall know get Lymington. I seen year. I hardly think one recognize you." "I think not; I care little do. Indeed, thee know me?" "Well, introduction save surmises, probably; I shall take among may inclined ask questions. See, steeple; quarter hour's drive." As soon arrived Lymington, Oswald directed way small hostelry keepers verderers usually resorted. In fact, landlord party took venison hands, disposed it. They drove yard, and, giving pony cart charge hostler, went inn, found landlord, one two people, drinking. "Well, Master Andrew, fare you?" said Oswald. "Let see," said corpulent landlord, throwing back his head, putting his stomach, he peered Oswald. "Why, Oswald Partridge, I born man. Where many day!" "In forest, Master Andrew, chops changes." "Yes, sort Parliamentary keeper, I am told; you?" "The grandson old friend yours, dead, poor old Jacob Armitage." "Jacob dead, poor fellow! As true flint Jacob Armitage, I am born man! And he dead! Well, owe Heaven death. Foresters landlords, well kings, must die!" "I brought Edward Armitage introduce you, Master Andrew. Now old man dead, must look forest meat." "Oh, well, well, scarce now. I time. Old Jacob brought last. You one Parliamentary foresters, then, I presume?" continued landlord, turning Edward. "No," replied Edward, "I kill venison Roundheads." "Right, sapling; right well said. The Armitages good men true, followed fortunes Beverleys; Beverleys follow now. Cut off--root branch--more's pity. That sad business. But come in; must talk here, walls ears, say, one never knows one dares speak now." Oswald Edward entered landlord, arrangements made Master Andrew latter regular supply venison season, certain price; would dangerous bring town, agreed ready, Edward come Lymington give notice, landlord would send people bring night. This bargain concluded, took glass landlord, went town make necessary purchases. Oswald took Edward shops articles he required purchased; carried away them; others, heavy, left, called cart went away. Among articles, Edward required powder lead, went gunsmith's procured. While making his purchases, Edward perceived sword, he thought he seen before, hanging wall among weapons. "What sword that?" said he, man measuring powder. "It is sword, exactly," replied man; "and yet I return owner family. It brought cleaned one Colonel Beverley's people, called house burned, every soul perished. It one colonel's swords, I sure, E. B. silver plate engraved it. I bill owing work done Arnwood, I chance paid now; so, whether I sell sword, do, I hardly know." Edward remained silent little while, he could trust speak; last he replied: "To candid you, I am, family been, followers Beverley family, I sorry colonel's sword fall hands. I think, therefore, I pay bill due, may safely let hold sword security money, express understanding ever claimed Beverley family I give up." "Certainly," said Oswald; "nothing fairer clearly put." "I think so, too, young man," replied shopkeeper. "Of course leave name address?" "Yes; friend vouch correct," replied Edward. The shopkeeper produced account, Edward paid; giving paper name Edward Armitage, he took possession sword. He paid powder lead, Oswald took charge of, and, hardly able conceal his joy, hastened shop. "Oswald," cried Edward, "I would part thousands pounds. I never part life." "I believe so," replied Oswald; "and I believe more, never disgraced hands; talk loud, listeners spies everywhere. Is thing else require?" "No, I think not; fact is, sword put every thing head. If anything else, I forgotten it. Let us go back inn, harness pony, call flour oatmeal." When arrived inn, Oswald went yard get cart ready, Edward went landlord's room make inquiries quantity venison he would able take his hands time. Oswald taken sword Edward, put cart he fastening harness, man came cart looked earnestly sword. He examined it, said Oswald, "Why Colonel Beverley's, old master's sword. I knowed directly. I took Phillips, gun maker, cleaned." "Indeed!" replied Oswald; "I pray, may name?" "Benjamin White," replied man; "I served Arnwood till night burned down; I ever since." "And now?" "I am tapster 'Commonwealth,' Fish-street--not much place." "Well, well, stand pony, look nobody takes thing cart, I go parcels." "Yes, sure I will; but, I say, forester, came sword?' "I tell I come again," replied Oswald. Oswald went Edward, told occurred. "He certainly know you, sir, must come till I get away," said he. "You right, Oswald; he goes, ask became aunt, she buried; also ask servants are--perhaps Lymington well he." "I find out," replied Oswald, left Edward, returned landlord recommenced conversation. Oswald his return, told Benjamin manner sword procured shopman, grandson old Armitage. "I never knew he one," replied Benjamin; "nor I know old Jacob dead." "What became women Arnwood?" inquired Oswald. "Why, Agatha married one troopers, went away London." "And others?" "Why, cook went home her friends, live ten miles here, I never heard her since." "But three them," said Oswald. "Oh, yes; Phoebe," relied Benjamin, looking rather confused. "She married trooper--the jilt!--and went London Agatha did. If I would thought she would done so, I would earned her away Arnwood behind me, pillion, I did; she might burned poor children, I cared." "Was old lady killed?" "Yes; say, she killed herself, rather kill Southwold." "Where she buried?" "In church-yard St. Faith's, mayor corporation; money enough found upon her person pay expenses her burial." "And tapster Commonwealth. Is good inn?" "Cannot say much it. I shall not stay longer I help, I tell you." "Well, must easy place, stay away long now." "Will not I mobbed I go back! that is always case, make haste not, it is one. However, I think I must agoing now, good-by, Mr. Forester; tell Jacob Armitage's grandson I shall glad see him, old Jacob's sake; it is hard, I will find something drink he calls." "I will: I shall see to-morrow." replied Oswald, getting cart; "so good-by, Benjamin," much satisfaction Oswald, thought he would never go. They went away rapid pace make lost time, soon disappeared around corner street. Oswald got again, summoned Edward, called flour heavy articles, set return. During drive, Oswald made known Edward information he gained Benjamin, late hour arrived safely cottage. They staid short time, tired; Oswald resolved upon setting daylight following morning, he without disturbing one; Humphrey dressed soon Oswald gave something eat he went along. All others remained fast asleep. Humphrey walked mile Oswald, returning farm he thought, he examined his pitfall many days, he might well look he went back. He therefore struck direction lay, arrived day began dawn. It end March, weather mild season. Humphrey arrived pit, sufficiently light perceive covering broken in, therefore, probability, something must trapped. He sat waited daylight, times he thought he heard heavy breathing, low groan. This made anxious, he peered pit, could long discover thing, last he thought he could make human figure lying bottom. Humphrey called out, asking one there. A groan reply, Humphrey horrified idea somebody fallen pit, perished, perishing want succor. Recollecting rough ladder he made take soil pit oak-tree, close hand, he ran it, put pit, cautiously descended. On his arrival bottom, his fears found verified, he saw body lad, half clothed, lying there. He turned lying face ground, attempted remove it, ascertain life it, he delighted find case. The lad groaned several times, opened his eyes. Humphrey afraid he strong enough lift his shoulders carry ladder; but, making attempt he found out, exhaustion, poor lad light enough carry him, he did, safely landed side pit. Recollecting watering-place herd cattle far off, Humphrey hastened it, filled his hat half full water. The lad, although he could speak, drank eagerly, minutes appeared much recovered. Humphrey gave more, bathed his face temples. The sun risen, broad daylight. The lad attempted speak, he say low tone, evidently foreign language, Humphrey could make out. He, therefore, made signs lad he going away, would back soon; having, he thought, made lad comprehend this, Humphrey ran away cottage fast he could; soon he arrived he called Edward, came out, Humphrey told words happened, Edward went cottage milk cake, Humphrey put pony cart. In moments again, soon arrived pitfall, found lad, still lying Humphrey left him. They soaked cake milk, soon soft gave some; time, he swallowed pretty freely, much recovered able sit up. They lifted cart, drove gently home cottage. "What think he is, Edward?" said Humphrey. "Some poor beggar lad, crossing forest." "No, exactly: he appears one Zingaros Gipsies, call them: he dark, black eyes white teeth, like I saw near Arnwood, I Jacob. Jacob said one knew came from, country, great thieves, told fortunes, played manner tricks." "Perhaps may so; I think he speak English." "I thankful Heaven I chanced morning visit pitfall. Only suppose I found poor boy starved dead! I unhappy, never pleasure looking cows, would always reminded melancholy accident." "Very true, Humphrey; saved misfortune, ought grateful Heaven case. What shall him?" "Why he chooses remain us, he useful cow-yard," said Humphrey. "Of course," replied Edward, laughing, "as he taken pit-fall, he must go yard others captured way." "Well, Edward, let us get right first, see done him; perhaps he refuse remain us." As soon arrived cottage, lifted lad cart, carried Jacob's room, laid bed, he weak stand. Alice Edith, much surprised new visitor way he caught, hastened get gruel ready him. As soon ready, gave boy, fell back bed exhaustion, soon sound sleep. He slept soundly night; next morning, he awoke, he appeared much better, although hungry. This last complaint easy remedy, lad got up, walked sitting-room. "What is name?" said Humphrey lad. "Pablo," replied lad. "Can speak English?" "Yes, little," replied he. "How happen fall pit?" "Not see hole." "Are gipsy?" "Yes, gitano--same thing." Humphrey put great many questions lad, elicited him, his imperfect English, following particulars: That he company several others his race, going sea-coast one usual migrations, pitched tents far pitfall. That night he gone set snares rabbits, going back tents, quite dark, he fallen hole; he remained three days nights, vain attempted get out. His mother party gipsies he belonged, he father. He know follow gang, said going, farther sea-coast. That use looking them; he care much leaving them, he unkindly treated. In reply question whether he would like remain them, work farm, he replied he like much would kind him, make work hard; he would cook dinner, catch rabbits birds, make great many things. "Will honest, keep you, tell lies?" said Edward. The lad thought little while, nodded his head affirmative. "Well, Pablo, try you, good lad make happy," said Edward; "but behave ill shall obliged turn doors: understand?" "Be good I can," replied Pablo; conversation ended present. Pablo short-built lad, apparently fifteen sixteen years age, dark complexion, handsome features, beautiful white teeth large dark eyes; certainly something his intelligent countenance recommended him, independent his claim kindness his left thus friendless consequence his misadventure. Humphrey particularly pleased interested him, lad nearly lost his life his means. "I really think, Edward," said Humphrey, standing outside door cottage, "that lad may useful us, I sincerely hope he may prove honest true. We must first get health spirits, I see he do." "The fact is, dear Humphrey, otherwise; he separated his friends, know go. It would inhuman, his misfortune, turn away; although I feel this, I feel much security his good behavior useful. I always told gipsies vagrants, lived stealing could lay hands upon; and, he brought way, I fear he easily reformed. However, try, hope best." "What say just, Edward; time honest look lad, although he gipsy, makes put sort confidence him. Admitting he taught wrong, think told contrary he may persuaded right?" "It impossible, certainly," replied Edward; "but, Humphrey, safe side, trust far know him." "That I certainly not," replied Humphrey. "When purpose going keepers cottage, Edward?" "In day two; I exactly humor civil Roundheads, although one I promised visit lady, amiable, pretty little girl bargain." "Why, Edward, made feel opposed usual?" "In first place, Humphrey, murder king--for murder nothing better--I get head; yesterday I obtained I consider almost gift Heaven, given intention I make use it." "And that, Edward?" "Our gallant father's sword, he drew nobly well defense his sovereign, Humphrey, I trust his son may one day wield equal distinction, and, may be, better fortune. Come me, I show you." Edward Humphrey went bedroom, Edward brought sword, he placed his side bed. "See, Humphrey, father's sword; and," continued Edward, kissing weapon, "I trust I may permitted draw revenge his death, death one whose life ever sacred." "I trust will, dear brother," replied Humphrey; "you strong arm good because. Heaven grant may prosper! But tell came it." Edward related passed his visit Oswald Lymington, forgetting tell Benjamin's appearance, arrangements he made relative sale venison. As soon dinner over, Edward Humphrey took guns, agreed would go hunt wild cattle. "Humphrey, idea herd cattle feeding time?" "I know feeding yesterday day before, I think changed ground, grass yet young grown southern aspects. Depend upon shall fall four miles are, nearer." "We must stalk deer, must not? They will not allow us approach within shot, Humphrey, they?" said Edward. "We take chance, Edward; allow us advance within shot, bulls advance upon us, herd increase distance. On hand, stalk them, may kill one, report gun frighten others away. In first instance risk; second none, fatigue trouble. Choose please; I act decide." "Well, Humphrey, since give choice, I think time I shall take bull horns, saying is; is, trees near us, herd open place I would run risk; fire upon fall back upon tree case bull charging, I take openly." "With heart, Edward; I think hard if, two guns Smoker back us, manage masters field. However, must survey well make approach; get within shot without alarming irritating them, we, course, so." "The bulls savage spring time," observed Edward. "They times, far I see them," replied Humphrey; "but near now, I think--yes, herd." "There are, sure enough," replied Edward; "now deer, need cautious; still animals wary, keep sharp look-out. We must approach quietly, slipping tree tree. Smoker, heel!--down---quiet, Smoker!--good dog!" Edward Humphrey stopped load guns, approached herd manner proposed, soon within two hundred yards cattle, behind large oak, stopped reconnoiter. The herd contained seventy head cattle, various sizes ages. They feeding directions, scattered, young grass short; although herd spread many acres land, Edward pointed Humphrey full-grown large bulls outside, ready defend others case attack. "Humphrey," said Edward, "one thing clear--as herd placed present, must bull nothing. It impossible get within shot others without passing bull, depend upon it, passage disputed; moreover herd take flight, shall get nothing all." "Well," replied Humphrey, "beef beef; and, say, beggars must choosers, let bull must so." "Let us get nearer them, decide shall do. Steady, Smoker!" They advanced gradually, hiding tree tree, within eighty yards one bulls. The animal perceive them, within range, stepped behind tree consult. "Now, Edward, I think would best separate. You fire are, I crawl fern, get behind another tree." "Very well, so," replied Edward: "if manage, get tree low branches, perhaps within shot white bull, coming direction. Smoker, lie down! He go you, Humphrey; safe." The distance tree Humphrey ventured get one one hundred fifty yards Edward standing. Humphrey crawled along time fern, last he came bare spot ten yards wide, aware of, he could concealed. Humphrey hesitated, last decided upon attempting cross it. Edward, one moment watching motions Humphrey, another two animals nearest them, perceived white bull farthest him, nearest Humphrey, threw head air, pawed his foot, advanced roar Humphrey ground, still crawling toward tree, passed open spot, many yards tree. Perceiving danger his brother in, that, moreover, Humphrey aware it, he hardly knew act. The bull far fire chance success; let Humphrey know animal discovered making toward him, without calling out, he know. All thought moment, Edward determined fire bull nearest him, he promised till Humphrey also ready fire, firing call Humphrey. He therefore, one moment, turned away his brother, and, taking aim bull, fired his gun; probably his nerves little shaken idea Humphrey danger, wound mortal, bull galloped back herd, formed closed phalanx quarter mile distant. Edward turned his brother was, perceived bull made rest cattle, within thirty yards Humphrey, advancing upon him, Humphrey standing beside tree his gun ready file. Humphrey fired, and, appeared, he also missed his aim; animal made him; Humphrey, great quickness, dropped his gun, and, swinging lower boughs, tree, bull's reach moment. Edward smiled he perceived Humphrey safe; still he prisoner, bull went round round tree roaring looking Humphrey. Edward thought minute, loaded his gun, ordered Smoker run bull. The dog, restrained Edward's keeping his feet, sprung forward attack. Edward intended, calling dog, induce bull follow till within gun-shot; bull attacked, Edward observed one two bulls left herd, coming rapid pace toward him. Under circumstances, Edward perceived his chance climb tree himself, he did, taking good care take his gun ammunition him. Having safely fixed forked bough, Edward surveyed position parties. There Humphrey tree, without his gun. The bull pursued Humphrey running Smoker, appeared aware he decoy bull toward Edward, he kept retreating toward him. In mean time, two bulls quite close hand, mingling bellowing roaring first; one near Edward first bull, engaged Smoker. At last, one advancing bulls stood still, pawing ground disappointed finding enemy, forty yards Edward perched. Edward took good aim, he fired bull fell dead. Edward reloading his piece he heard howl, looking round, saw Smoker flying air, tossed first bull; time he observed Humphrey descended tree, recovered his gun, safe upon lower bough. The first bull advancing attack Smoker, appeared incapable getting away, much he injured fall, bull, apparently must old antagonist first, roared attacked him; two boys tree, two bulls fighting them, Smoker lying ground, panting exhausted. As bulls, locked horns, furiously pressing other, guns discharged, animals fell. After waiting little see rose again, herd came up, Edward Humphrey descended trees heartily shook hands. CHAPTER XII. "A narrow escape, Humphrey!" said Edward he held his brother's hand. "Yes, indeed, may thank Heaven preservation," replied Humphrey; "and poor Smoker! let us see he much hurt." "I trust not," said Edward, going dog, remained quite still ground, his tongue out, panting violently. They examined poor Smoker carefully, found external wound; Edward pressing his side, animal gave low howl. "It horn bull took him," observed Humphrey. "Yes," said Edward, pressing feeling softly: "and he two his ribs broken. Humphrey, see get little water, recover thing else; bull knocked breath his body. I think he soon well again, poor fellow." Humphrey soon returned water neighboring pool. He brought his hat gave dog, lapped slowly first, afterward much faster, wagging his tail. "He now," said Edward; "we must give time recover himself. Now then, let us examine quarry. Why, Humphrey, quantity meat here! It take three journeys Lymington least." "Yes, time lose, weather getting warm already, Edward. Now do? Will remain I go home cart?" "Yes, it is use going; I stay watch poor Smoker, take skins ready time back again. Leave knife well own, one soon blunt." Humphrey gave his knife Edward, taking his gun, set cottage. Edward skinned two bulls Humphrey's return; Smoker, although he evidently great pain, his legs again. As soon finished quartered beasts, cart loaded returned home; return second time, pony tired sat supper They found gipsy boy much recovered good spirits. Alice said he amusing Edith her tossing three potatoes time, playing like balls; he spun platter upon iron skewer balanced his chin. They gave supper, he ate chimney corner, looking staring every Edith, he appeared much attached already. "Is good?" said Humphrey boy, giving another venison steak. "Yes; good supper pithole," replied Pablo, laughing. Early following morning, Edward Humphrey set Lymington cart laden meat. Edward showed Humphrey shops streets purchases made--introduced landlord hostelry--and sold meat, returned home. The rest meat taken Lymington disposed Humphrey following day; day three skins carried town disposed of. "We made good day's work, Edward," said Humphrey, he reckoned money made. "We earned risk, events," replied Edward; "and now, Humphrey, I think time I keep promise Oswald, go intendant's house, pay visit young lady, I presume she is--and certainly she every appearance one. I want visit over, I want doing." "How mean, Edward?" "I mean I want go kill deer, I till I seen her: I shall acquitted visit, I intend defy intendant his verderers." "But visit prevent going day, inclined?" "I do not know, she may ask I done so, I want tell her I have; neither I want say I not, I have; therefore I shall commence till I seen her." "When set off?" "To-morrow morning; I shall take gun, although Oswald desired not; fight wild cattle day, I do not think prudent unarmed; indeed, I feel comfortable without I gun, time." "Well, I shall plenty away--the potatoes must hoed up, I shall see I make Master Pablo. He appears well enough, he played quite long enough, I shall take garden to-morrow, set work. What quantity fruit promise orchard year! And Edward, boy turns use, help me, I think I shall take orchard garden, inclose another piece ground, see grow corn ourselves. It greatest expense present, I like take corn mill ground." "But growing corn require plow horses?" said Edward. "No; try hand: two us dig great deal odd times, shall better crop spade plow. We much manure afford it." "Well, done, done once, Humphrey, people side forest come find us out, dispute right inclosure." "The forest belongs king, brother, Parliament; king's liege men, look permission," replied Humphrey; "but say true: sooner done better, I once." "How much propose fencing in?" "About two three acres." "But dig year next." "I know that; I manure without digging, grass grow rich outside inclosure, suppose inclosed long while." "That is bad idea, Humphrey; I advise look well boy, he bad race, brought up, I afraid, strict notions honesty. Be careful, tell sisters also cautious let suppose money old chest, till find whether he trusted not." "Better let know circumstances," replied Humphrey; "he may continue honest, tempted knowledge thing worth stealing." "You right, Humphrey. Well, I to-morrow morning get visit over. I hope able get news her, her father away. "I hope get work Pablo," replied Humphrey; "how many things I could do, he would work! Now, I will tell one thing--I dig sawpit get saw, I cut boards build thing want. The first time I go Lymington I buy saw--I afford now; I will make carpenter's bench first thing, then, tools, I shall get on; then, Edward, I will tell else I do." "Then, Humphrey," replied Edward, laughing, "you must tell time, late, I must go bed, I rise early. I know many projects mind would take half night listen them." "Well, I believe say true," replied Humphrey, "and better one thing time talk hundred; will, say, bed." At sunrise, Edward Humphrey up; Alice came tapped her door, she would let Edward go without his breakfast. Edith joined them, went prayers. While employed, Pablo came listened said. When prayers over, Humphrey asked Pablo he knew doing. "No, much; suppose pray sun shine." "No, Pablo," said Edith, "pray God make us good." "You bad then?" said Pablo; "me bad." "Yes, Pablo, every body bad," said Alice; "but try good, God forgives us." The conversation dropped, soon Edward made his breakfast, he kissed his sisters, wished Humphrey farewell. Edward threw his gun his arm, calling his puppy, he named Holdfast, bade Humphrey his sisters farewell, set his journey across forest. Holdfast, well Humphrey's puppy, named Watch, grown fine young animals. The first named Holdfast, would seize pigs ears lead sty, alert least noise; but, Humphrey said, Watch ought learned lead pigs, his line business Holdfast's, brought hunting forest, Watch educated house farmyard dog. Edward refused take pony, Humphrey required farm-work, weather fine he preferred walking; so, would enable his return across forest try venison, he could done he mounted Billy's back. Edward walked quick, followed his dog, he taught keep heel. He felt happy, people cares, fine weather--the deep green verdure checkered flowers bloom, majestic scenery met his eye every side. His heart buoyant his steps, he walked along, light summer breeze fanning his face. His thoughts, however, chase thing else, suddenly changed, he became serious. For time he heard political news consequence, Commons king. This revery naturally brought his mind his father's death, burning his property, sequestration. His cheeks colored indignation, his brow moody. Then he built castles future. He imagined king released his prison, leading army his oppressors; he fancied head troop cavalry, charging Parliamentary horse. Victory his side. The king his throne, he possession family estate. He rebuilding hall, somehow another appeared Patience standing his side, he gave directions artificers, his revery suddenly disturbed Holdfast barking springing forward advance. Edward, time got half his journey, looked up, perceived confronted powerful man, apparently forty years age, dressed verderer forest. He thought time he seldom seen person sinister forbidding countenance. "How now, young fellow, here?" said man, walking cocking gun he held hand he advanced. Edward quietly cocked his gun, loaded, he perceived hostile preparation part person, replied, "I walking across forest, may perceive." "Yes, I perceive walking, walking dog gun: pleased walk me. Deer-stealers longer permitted range forest." "I deer-stealer," replied Edward. "It quite sufficient give title find venison possession; going you, I certainly shall not. Sheer off, may meet harm." "Why, young good-for-nothing, venison, take it; pursuit it, clear. Come, come, you have wrong person deal with; orders take poachers, take I will." "If can," replied Edward; "but must first prove able do; gun good aim sure yours, whoever may be. I tell again, I poacher, I come take deer, cross intendant's cottage, whither I going. I tell thus much, may thing foolish; said this, I advise think twice act once. Let proceed peace, may lose place, not, rashness, lose life." There something cool determined Edward's quiet manner, verderer hesitated. He perceived attempt take Edward would risk his life; he knew his orders apprehend poachers, shoot people. It true, resistance firearms would warrant his acting self-defense; admitting he succeed, doubtful, still Edward caught act killing venison, he witnesses prove occurred. He also knew intendant given strict orders shedding blood, he averse to, circumstances; something Edward's appearance manner different common person, he puzzled. Moreover, Edward stated he going intendant's house. All things considered, he found bullying would succeed, he thought advisable change his tone, therefore said, "You tell going intendant's house; business there, I presume? If I took prisoner, I conducted you, so, young man, may walk me." "I thank you," replied Edward, "but walk I not: choose half-cock gun again, walk side, I same. Those terms, I listen other; pleased make mind, I haste." The verderer appeared indignant reply, time said, "Be so." Edward uncocked his gun, his eyes fixed upon man, verderer same: walked side side, Edward keeping distance three yards him, case treachery. After moments' silence, verderer said, "You tell going intendant's house; he home." "But young Mistress Patience is, I presume," said Edward. "Yes," replied man, who, finding Edward appeared know much intendant's family, began civil. "Yes, she home, I saw her garden morning." "And Oswald, he home?" rejoined Edward. "Yes, he is. You appear know people, young man; may be, fair question?" "It would fair question treated fairly," replied Edward; "but concern yours, I shall leave find out." This reply puzzled man still more; he now, tone authority assumed Edward, began imagine he made mistake, he speaking superior, although clad forester's dress. He therefore answered humbly, observing he his duty. Edward walked without making reply. As arrived within hundred yards intendant's house Edward said-- "I arrived destination, going house, I told you. Do choose enter me, go Oswald Partridge tell met Edward Armitage forest, I glad see him? I believe his orders, not?" "Yes I am," replied verderer, "and I suppose all's right, I shall go deliver message." Edward turned away man, went wicket-gate garden, knocked door House. The door opened Patience Heatherstone herself, said, "Oh, glad I see you! Come in." Edward took his hat bowed. Patience led way her father's study, Edward first received. "And now," said Patience, extending her hand Edward, "thanks, many thanks, preserving dreadful death. You do not know unhappy I able give poor thanks courageous behavior." Her hand still remained Edward's she said this. "You rate I highly," replied Edward; "I would done one distress: duty a--man," Cavalier he say, he checked himself. "Sit down," said Patience, taking chair; "nay, ceremony; I treat inferior one I owe debt gratitude." Edward smiled he took his seat. "My father grateful I am--I am sure he is--for I heard him, prayer, call blessings head. What he you? I begged Oswald Partridge bring I might find out. Oh, sir, do, pray, let know show gratitude something words." "You shown already, Mistress Patience," replied Edward; "have honored poor forester hand friendship, even admitted sit you?" "He preserved life risk his becomes brother--at least I feel sister toward him: debt still debt, whether indebted king a--" "Forester, Mistress Patience; real word hesitated used. Do imagine I ashamed calling?" "To tell candidly truth, then," replied Patience: "I believe profess be. I mean say that, although forester now, never brought such. My father opinion allied mine." "I thank good opinion me, I fear I raise condition forester; nay, father's coming here, new regulations, I every chance sinking lower grade deer-stealer poacher; indeed, I gun me, I seized day I came over." "But shooting deer, you, sir?" inquired Patience. "No, I not; I killed since last I saw you." "I glad I say father," replied Patience; "it much please him. He said he thought capable much higher employment could offered here, wished know would accept. He interest--great interest--although variance rulers country, account the--" "Murder king, would said, Mistress Patience. I heard much he opposed foul deed, I honor it." "How kind, truly kind say so!" said Patience, tears starting her eyes; "what pleasure hear father's conduct praised you!" "Why, course, Mistress Patience, way thinking must praise him. Your father London, I hear?" "Yes, he is; reminds must want refreshment walk. I call Phoebe." So saying, Patience left room. The fact was, Mistress Patience reminded she sitting young man time, alone him--which quite proper times; Phoebe appeared cold viands, she retreated hearing, remained room. Edward partook meal offered silence, Patience occupying herself her work, keeping her eyes fixed it, unless she gave slight glance table see thing required. When meal over, Phoebe removed tray, Edward rose take his leave. "Nay, go yet--I much say first; let ask serve you." "I never take office present rulers nation, question rest." "I afraid would answer so," replied Patience, gravely: "do think I blame you; many already would gladly retrace steps possible. They little thought, opposed king, affairs would ended done. Where live, sir?" "At opposite side forest, house belonging now, inherited grandfather." "Do live alone--surely not?" "No, I not." "Nay, may tell thing, I would never repeat might hurt you, might wish known." "I live brother two sisters, grandfather lately dead." "Is brother younger are?" "He is." "And sisters, ages?" "They younger still." "You told father lived upon farm?" "We do." "Is large farm?" "No; small." "And support you?" "That killing wild cattle lately." "Yes, killing deer also, lately?" "You guessed right." "You brought Arnwood, told father; not?" "Yes, I brought there, remained death Colonel Beverley." "And educated, not?" "Yes; chaplain taught little I know." "Then, brought house educated chaplain, surely Colonel Beverley never intended forester?" "He not; I soldier soon I old enough bear arms." "Perhaps distantly related late Colonel Beverley." "No; I _distantly_ related," replied Edward, began feel uneasy close cross-examination; "but still, Colonel Beverley alive, king still required his services, I doubt I serving time. And now, Mistress Patience, I answered many questions yours, may I permitted ask little return? Have brothers?" "None; I child." "Have one parent alive?" "Only one." "What families connected with?" Patience looked surprise last question. "My mother's name Cooper; she sister Sir Anthony Ashley Cooper, person well known." "Indeed! gentle blood?" "I believe so," replied Patience, surprise. "Thank condescension, Mistress Patience; now, permit me, I take leave." "Before go, let thank saving worthless life," said Patience. "Well, must come again, father here; he glad opportunity thanking one preserved his child. Indeed, knew father, would feel much regard I do. He good, although he looks stern melancholy; he seldom smiled since poor mother's death." "As father, Mistress Patience, I think well I one joined party I hold detestation; I say more." "I must say I know, would, perhaps, find he quite wedded party suppose. Neither his brother-in-law he great friends Cromwell's, I assure you; confidence." "That raises estimation; he hold office?" "He ask it; given him, I really believe, wished way; he accepted he opposed going on, wished away. At least I infer much I learned. It office power trust leagues present government." "No; one opposes malpractices," replied Edward, laughing. "Well, Mistress Patience, shown great condescension poor forester, I return many thanks kindness toward me: I take leave." "And come see father?" "I say; I fear I shall able soon look his injured face, well poacher come near him," replied Edward: "however, day I may taken brought prisoner, know, he certain see me." "I tell kill deer," replied Patience; "but kill one shall harm you--or I know little power father's. Farewell then, sir, gratitude thanks." Patience held her hand Edward, time, like true Cavalier, raised respectfully his lips. Patience colored little, attempt withdraw it, Edward, low obeisance, quitted room. CHAPTER XIII. As soon he intendant's house, Edward hastened cottage Oswald Partridge, he found waiting him, verderer failed deliver his message. "You long talk Mistress Patience," said Oswald, first greeting, "and I glad it, gives consequence here. The Roundhead rascal met inclined, precise his duty, insisted he certain look-out deer; I stopped his mouth telling I often took me, best shot whole forest, intendant knew I so. I think caught act killing deer, better tell, killed request, I bear bring intendant, will, I am sure, thank saying so; might kill deer forest, done him." "Many thanks; I think I take advantage offer. Let catch can, catch me, let take can." "I see, sir, accept favor Roundheads," replied Oswald. "However, I head keeper, I shall take care men interfere you, I help it; I wish prevent insult indignity offered you, aware are, I am." "Many thanks, Oswald; I must take chance." Edward told Oswald taken gipsy boy pit, he appeared much amused. "What name verderer I met forest?" inquired Edward. "James Corbould; he discharged army," replied Oswald. "I like his appearance," said Edward. "No; his face tells him," replied Oswald; "but I know nothing him; he little fortnight." "Can give corner put head to-night, Oswald? I shall start till to-morrow morning." "You may command I have, sir," replied Oswald; "but I fear little hearty welcome; I doubt could lodged intendant's house choose." "No, Oswald, young lady alone, I trust Phoebe's accommodation again; I stay here, permit me." "And welcome, sir; I put puppy kennel once." Edward remained night Oswald's, daylight he rose, taken slight breakfast, throwing his gun his shoulder, went kennel Holdfast, set his return home. "That is nice little girl," words Edward found constantly saying he walked along; "and she grateful disposition, she would behaved she done toward me--supposing mean birth;" he thought she told relative her father, Edward felt his animosity Roundhead wasting fast away. "I likely see her soon," thought Edward, "unless, indeed, I brought intendant prisoner." Thus thinking upon, one subject another, Edward gained eight miles his journey across forest, he thought he sufficiently far away venture look venison. Remembering thicket far clear pool water, Edward thought likely he might find stag cooling himself, weather warm noonday. He therefore called Holdfast him, proceeded cautiously toward thicket. As soon he arrived spot, he crouched crept silently underwood. At last he arrived close cleared spot pool. There stag there, fast asleep upon turf lay James Corbould, sinister-looking verderer accosted forest previous day. Holdfast bark, Edward silenced him, advanced verderer lying; who, dog give notice Edward's approach, still remained snoring sun shining his face. Edward perceived his gun grass, he took up, gently opened pan scattered powder, laid again--for Edward said himself, "That man come me, I certain; witnesses, he may inclined mischievous, wretched-looking person I never saw. Had he deer-hunting, he would brought his dog; he man-hunting, evident. Now I leave him, he fall anything, he kill first shot, that is certain; he follows me, I shall chance escape anything else he may fire at." Edward walked covert, thinking ever face proclaimed man murderer, James Corbould. As he threading his way, he heard howl dog, looking round, perceived Holdfast him. He turned back, Holdfast came running him--the fact was, Holdfast smelled meat pocket verderer, putting his nose ascertain was: doing, he wakened Corbould, saluted heavy blow head: occasioned puppy give howl, also occasioned Corbould seize his gun, follow stealthily track dog, he well knew one he seen day Edward. Edward waited short time, perceiving Corbould made his appearance, continued his way home, given thoughts killing venison. He walked fast, within six miles cottage, he stopped drink small rill water, sat rest short time. While doing, he fell one his usual reveries, forgot time passed away. He was, however, aroused low growl part Holdfast, immediately occurred Corbould must followed him. Thinking well prepared, he quietly loaded his gun, rose reconnoiter. Holdfast sprung forward, Edward, looking direction, perceived Corbould partly hidden behind tree, his gun leveled him. He heard trigger pulled, snap lock, gun go off; Corbould made his appearance, striking Holdfast butt-end his gun. Edward advanced desired desist, would worse him. "Indeed, younker! may worse you," cried Corbould. "It might gun gone off," replied Edward. "I aim you. I aimed dog, I kill brute I can." "Not without danger yourself; aimed at--your gun pointed low enough hit dog--it leveled me, sneaking wretch; I thank prudence sleepy head escaped life. I tell candidly, I threw powder pan asleep. If I served deserve, I put bullet you; I kill man defenseless--and saves life; set fast away me, follow I show forbearance. Away directly," continued Edward, raising his gun his shoulder pointing Corbould; "if off, I will fire." Corbould saw Edward resolute, thought proper comply his request: he walked away till he considered gunshot, commenced torrent oaths abusive language, shall offend readers. Before he went farther, he swore he would Edward's life many days passed, shaking his fist, he went away. Edward remained he standing till man fairly sight, proceeded his journey. It four of the clock afternoon, Edward, he walked on, said himself, "That man must wicked disposition, I offended nothing except submitting made his prisoner; offense take man's life for? He dangerous man, dangerous foiled he to-day. I doubt he go home; I almost sure he turn follow he thinks he without seeing him; he does, he find cottage is--and knows mischief he may do, he may alarm little sisters? I will go home till dark; I will walk another direction, I may mislead him." Edward walked away north, every half hour shifted his course walking different direction cottage stood. In mean time grew gradually dark; became so, every Edward passed large tree, he turned round behind looked see Corbould following him. At last, dark, he perceived figure man great distance him, following him, running tree tree, make his approach. "Oh, there!" thought Edward; "now I give nice dance, see whose legs tired soonest. Let see, I?" Edward looked round, perceived he close clump trees Humphrey made his pitfall cattle, clear spot quarter mile he stood. Edward made his mind, immediately walked cross clearing, calling Holdfast heel. It nearly dark, light stars, still sufficient light see his way. As Edward crossed cleared spot, he looked round perceived Corbould following him, nearer he before, trusting probably increased darkness hide his approach. "That do," thought Edward; "come along, fine fellow." And Edward walked till he came pitfall; he stopped looked round, soon discovered verderer hundred yards' distance. Edward held his dog mouth, he growl bark, went direction bring pitfall exactly Corbould himself. Having done so, he proceeded rapid pace; Corbould, following him, also increased his, till he arrived pitfall, he could perceive, fell headlong; he fell pit, time Edward heard discharge his gun, crash small branches laid it, cry part Corbould. "That do," thought Edward, "now may lie long gipsy did, cool courage. Humphrey's pitfall full adventure. In case done service. Now I may turn go home fast I can. Come Holdfast, old boy, want suppers. I answer one, I could eat whole pasty Oswald set morning." Edward walked rapid pace, quite delighted issue adventure. As he arrived near cottage he found Humphrey outside, Pablo, look-out him. He soon joined them, soon embraced Alice Edith, anxiously waiting his return, wondered his late. "Give supper, dear girls," said Edward, "and shall know it." As soon Edward satisfied his craving appetite--for he not, readers must recollect, eaten thing since his departure early morning house Oswald Partridge--he entered narrative events day. They listened great interest; Edward finished, Pablo, gipsy boy, jumped said, "Now he pit, to-morrow morning I take gun shoot him." "No, no, Pablo, must that," replied Edward, laughing. "Pablo," said little Edith, "go sit down; must shoot people." "He shoot master then," said Pablo; "he bad man." "But shoot him, bad boy, Pablo," replied Edith, appeared assumed authority him. Pablo appear understand this, he obeyed order his little mistress, resumed his seat chimney corner. "But, Edward," said Humphrey, "what propose do?" "I hardly know; idea let remain day two, send Oswald let know fellow was." "The objection is," replied Humphrey, "that say his gun went he fell pit; may probable he wounded, so, he might die he left there." "You right, Humphrey, possible; I would life fellow-creature conscience." "I think would advisable, Edward, I set early to-morrow pony, see Oswald, tell occurred, show pitfall is." "I believe would best plan, Humphrey." "Yes," said Alice, "it would dreadful man die wicked state; let taken out, perhaps he repent." "Will not God punish him, brother?" said Edith. "Yes, dear; sooner later vengeance Heaven overtakes wicked. But I tired long walk Prayers, bed." The danger Edward incurred day felt strongly whole party; and, exception Pablo earnest devotion gratitude Heaven orisons offered up. Humphrey daybreak, nine of the clock arrived cottage Oswald, he warmly greeted his unexpected arrival made known. Oswald greatly annoyed Humphrey's narration, appeared much opinion Pablo, was, leave scoundrel he was; but, remonstrance Humphrey, he set off, two verderers, nightfall Humphrey arrived pitfall, heard Corbould groaning below. "Who is there?" said Oswald, looking pit. "It is me, it is Corbould," replied man. "Are hurt?" "Yes, badly," replied Corbould; "when I fell, gun went off, ball gone thigh. I almost bled death." Humphrey went ladder, hand, and, much exertion part whole four them, contrived drag Corbould, groaned heavily pain. A handkerchief tied tightly round his leg, prevent bleeding, gave water, revived him. "Now, what is done?" said Oswald; "we never get home." "I tell you," said Humphrey, walking aside. "It men know cottage, take there. Desire remain man, go cart carry home. We go cottage, give Billy his supper, return cart, bring men something eat. Then I go you, bring cart back daylight. It night's work, safest plan." "I think so, too," replied Oswald, desired men wait till his return, he going borrow cart, set Humphrey. As soon arrived cottage, Humphrey gave pony Pablo put stable feed, communicated Edward state Corbould. "It is almost pity he killed outright." observed Oswald; "it would justice him, attempting life without because; he bloodthirsty scoundrel, I wish he he is. However, intendant shall know it, I doubt he discharged. "Do nothing hurry, Oswald," replied Edward; "at present let give his version affair, he may prove dangerous discharged control. Now sit take supper. Billy must hour get his, therefore hurry you." "That gipsy lad, Edward, he not?" said Oswald. "Yes." "I like boy's looks; queer race. You must trust much," continued Oswald, undertone, "until tried him, satisfied his fidelity. They excitable, capable strong attachment well treated. That I know, I gipsy good turn once, proved saving life afterward." "Oh, tell us how, Oswald," said Alice. "It long story now, dear little lady," replied Oswald; "but I another time. Whatever he may do, strike him; never forgive blow, I told know them, never good; I said before, queer race." "He beaten us," replied Humphrey, "depend upon it, unless Edith slaps him, she one takes pains him, I presume he would care much her little hand." "No, no," replied Oswald, laughing; "Edith may she pleases. What he you?" "Oh, nothing yet, he hardly recovered, poor fellow," replied Humphrey. "He follows Edith, helps her look eggs; last night he set springes his fashion, certainly beat me, he took three rabbits hare, I, traps, took one rabbit." "I think better leave part livelihood entirely him; he bred it, Humphrey, his amusement. You must expect work hard; accustomed it. They live roving never work help it: still, make fond you, he may useful, clever handy." "I hope make useful," replied Humphrey; "but still I force he like. He fond pony already, likes take care him." "Bring one days, he may know find me. It may prove consequence message send, come yourselves." "That true," replied Edward; "I shall forget it. Humphrey, shall I go cart?" "Humphrey, means; suppose I cart you, Edward; know Humphrey, he morning up." "Very true," replied Edward. "And time us set off," replied Oswald. "Will Mistress Alice oblige something men eat, fasted whole day." "Yes," replied Alice; "I ready pony cart. Edith, dear, come me." Humphrey went harness pony, ready, he Oswald set again. When arrived pitfall, found Corbould lying two verderers, sitting his side. Corbould much recovered since his wound bound up, he raised put fodder Humphrey put cart; proceeded journey side forest, verderers eating Humphrey brought walked along. It tedious painful journey wounded man, shrieked cart jolted wheel getting rut hole; help it, he much exhausted arrived, till past midnight. Corbould taken his cottage put bed, another verderer sent surgeon; Oswald glad go bed, fatiguing day. Humphrey remained Oswald three hours, returned Billy, who, although he crossed forest three times twenty-four hours, appeared quite fresh ready go back again. "I let know he gets on, Humphrey, account he gives his falling pit; must expect fortnight least." Humphrey wished Oswald good-by; Billy anxious get back his stable, Humphrey could keep quiet pace. "Horses, animals indeed, know place like home; pity men consider much wiser, consideration," thought Humphrey, pony trotted along. Humphrey thought good deal danger Edward subjected to, said himself, "I really think I comfortable Edward away. I always fidget him. I wish new king, France would raise army come over. It better Edward fighting field remain risk shot deer-stealer, put prison. The farm sufficient us all; I taken ground much sufficient, even I kill wild cattle. I fit farm, Edward not. He thrown away, living obscurity, he feels it. He always hot water way another, certain. What narrow escape he scoundrel, yet little he cares it! He intended soldier, evident; and, ever he one, he his element, distinguish himself, pleases God spare his life. I will persuade stay home little help inclose piece ground; and, done, I will dig saw-pit, see I coax Pablo saw me. I must go Lymington buy saw. If I could get trees sawed planks, quantity things I could make, I could improve place!" Thus thought Humphrey, he went along; he farm improvements, always calculating he another calf, fresh litter pigs. His first idea he would make Pablo work hard, advice he received Oswald forgotten; he thinking he coax Pablo standing sawpit, hard work, disagreeable sawdust falling eyes. Humphrey's cogitations interrupted halloo, turning round direction voice, he perceived Edward, turned cart join him. "You have come time, Humphrey; I provision Alice's larder. I took gun came path I knew would return by, I killed young buck. He good meat, scarce provisions." Humphrey helped Edward put venison cart, returned cottage, three miles off. Humphrey told Edward result his journey, proposed Edward stop home days help new inclosure. To Edward cheerfully consented; soon arrived cottage, Humphrey his breakfast, took axes went fell cluster small spruce-fir mile off. CHAPTER XIV. "Now, Humphrey, propose do?" "This," replied Humphrey: "I marked three acres thereabout land running straight line behind garden. There tree it, good feeding-ground. What I intend inclose spruce-fir posts rails cut down, set hedge upon low bank I shall raise round inside rails. I know thousands seedling-thorns, I shall take winter, early spring, put in, bank ready time." "Well, that is good; I fear long quantity land dug up." "Yes, course will; but, Edward, I plenty manure spare, I shall put land, become rich pasture, also earlier pasture get forest, handy turn cows calves upon; even Billy, want hurry." "All true," replied Edward; "so useful events, dig up." "Indeed will," replied Humphrey; "I wish six acres instead three." "I cannot say I do," replied Edward, laughing; "you grand ideas; think quantity spruces shall cut it, post rail propose. Let three acres first, Humphrey; inclosed, may begin talk three more." "Well, perhaps right, Edward," said Humphrey. "Why, here is Pablo coming us; he is coming work, I presume, amuse looking on." "I do not think he is strong enough much hard work, Humphrey, although he appears ingenious." "No, I agree you; he work, depend upon must work set him; he would take disgust directly. I another plan him." "And that, Humphrey?" "I shall set thing do, shall make believe I think he able thing. That pique him, I think means I shall get work would think, especially when, he done it, I express wonder give praise." "Not bad idea, that; work upon his pride, probably stronger his laziness." "I think lazy, I think unused hard work, lived life wandering idleness, easy brought constant dayly work, except degrees, means I propose. Here are," continued Humphrey, throwing his ax bill-hook down, proceeding take his doublet; "now hour two's fulfillment sentence first parents--to wit, 'the sweat brow.'" Edward followed Humphrey's example taking his doublet; selected long thin trees fitted rails, hard work Pablo came them. More dozen trees fallen, lay one upon other, stopped recover little. "Well, Pablo," said Humphrey, wiping his forehead, "I suppose think looking better cutting trees; is." "What cut trees for?" "To make posts rails fence ground. I shall leave boughs on." "No cut by-and-by, put poles cart carry home." Edward Humphrey recommenced labor, worked another half hour, paused recover wind. "Hard work, Pablo," said Humphrey. "Yes, hard work; Pablo strong enough." "Oh no, able thing kind, I know. No work gipsies; take birds' nests catch rabbits." "Yes," replied Pablo, nodding, "and eat them." "So he does, Pablo," said Edward, "so useful way; he nothing eat, he would able work. Strong man cut trees, weak man catch rabbits." "Both good," said Pablo. "Yes, strong man like work; strong man like work, Pablo. So look again, must another spell." "Strong man cut trees, strong man cut branches," said Pablo, taking bill-hook setting work cut boughs, he great dexterity rapidity. Edward Humphrey exchanged glances smiles, worked away silence till was, supposed, dinner time. They wrong supposition, although clock appetites, which, however, tell time pretty correctly work hard. Alice platters table, looking see coming. "Why, Pablo, work?" said Edith. "Yes, little missy, work morning." "Indeed he has, worked well, useful," said Edward. "It given appetite dinner, Pablo, not?" said Humphrey. "Have without work," replied boy. "Pablo, good gipsy boy," said Edith, patting his head patronizing air; "I shall let walk carry basket put eggs come home evening." "That reward," said Humphrey, laughing. After dinner continued labor, supper time many trees cut down, determined carry home next day, lay along see many would want. While put trees cart took home, Pablo contrived lop boughs prepare poles take away. As soon cut sufficient carted home, selected shorter trees posts; Pablo cleared boughs, sawed proper lengths, carted home. This occupied nearly whole week, proceeded dig holes set posts in. The railing nailed posts, occupied three days more; altogether fortnight hard work three acres inclosed. "There," said Humphrey, "that is good job over; many thanks, Edward, assistance; thank you, too, Pablo, really helped us much indeed, useful, good boy. Now raising bank; I must I spare time; garden overrun weeds, I must get Edith Alice help there." "If do not want longer, Humphrey," said Edward, "I think I shall go see Oswald, take Pablo me. I want know fellow Corbould is, he says; whether intendant come back; I shall go near his good little daughter, I think I may well go, good opportunity showing Pablo way Oswald's cottage." "I think too; come back, Edward, one us must go Lymington, I require tools, Pablo ragged. He must better clothes old ones ours, he sent messages. Do not think so?" "Certainly I do." "And I want thousand things," said Alice. "Indeed, mistress, will not less thousand content you?" "Yes, perhaps quite thousand, I really want great many, I make list them. I pans enough milk; I want salt; I want tubs; I make list, find long one." "Well, I hope something sell pay them?" "Yes; I plenty butter salted down." "What you, Edith?" "Oh, chickens large enough yet; soon Humphrey must get ducks geese; I mean keep some; by-and-by I turkeys, yet. I must wait till Humphrey builds new house he promised me." "I think right, Edith, ducks geese; well water behind yard, I dig bigger pool them." "Edith, dear, little fingers made weed onions well, I wish would to-morrow morning, time." "Yes, Humphrey, little fingers will not smell nice afterward." "Not till washed them, I guess; soap water, know." "Yes, I know is; I weed onions, I help Alice make butter; however, Alice without me, I it." "I want seeds sadly," said Humphrey, "and I must make list. I must go Lymington time, Edward, puzzled wants." "Not I know exactly want; I really not, probably make mistakes, I think better go. But bedtime, I shall start early, good-night, sisters; I beg let something eat I start. I shall try venison I come back, shall take Smoker me; he quite well again, his ribs stout ever." "And, Edward," said Alice, "I wish, kill venison, would bring home parts usually throw away, I assure you, three dogs, I hardly know find enough eat." "I will fail, Alice," replied Edward, "and good-night." Early next morning Edward took his gun, and, Pablo Smoker, set Oswald's cottage. Edward talked great deal Pablo relative his former life; and, answers boy gave him, satisfied that, notwithstanding his doubtful way bringing up, lad corrupted, well-minded boy. As walked grove trees, Edward still talking, Pablo stopped put his hand Edward's mouth, stooping down, time seizing Smoker neck, he pointed his finger. Edward first could see nothing, eventually he made horns animal rising hillock. It evidently one wild cattle. Edward cocked his gun advanced cautiously, Pablo remained he was, holding Smoker. As soon he near enough hit head animal, Edward leveled fired, Pablo let Smoker loose, bounded forward hillock. They followed dog found seize calf stood heifer Edward shot. Edward called went animal; fine young heifer, calf fortnight old. "We stop now, Pablo," said Edward. "Humphrey would like calf, must take chance remaining mother till come back. I think day two, let us push on." No adventure happened, arrived little noon Oswald's cottage. He home, his wife saying she believed he intendant, come back London day before. "But I put hood see," said young woman. In minutes she returned Oswald. "I glad come, sir," said Oswald, Edward extended his hand, "as I seen intendant, he asking many questions you. I certain he thinks grandson Jacob Armitage, he supposes I know are. He asked cottage was, whether I could take it, he wished speak you, said he felt great interest you." "And say?" "I said cottage good day's journey here, I certain I knew exact way, I seldom, I knew find I saw forests Arnwood; I told Corbould his attempt upon you, he wroth. I never saw moved before; young Mistress Patience, she indeed angry perplexed, begged her father send assailant away soon he could moved. Master Heatherstone replied, 'Leave me, dear;' asked account Corbould gave himself, his falling pit. I told Corbould stated he following deer, he severely wounded noonday, dog he could overtake it, although he knew bleeding track could hold much longer. That he followed nightfall, view close him, he fell pit." "Well, story badly made up," said Edward, "only _a deer_ read _man:_ intendant say that?" "He said he believed you, Corbould's story false--as, stag he following, one would known he fallen pit, he would remained till now. I quite forgot say, intendant said he wished call cottage, young mistress said she wished go him, told her two sisters living you, she wished much see make acquaintance." "I afraid shall able prevent visit, Oswald," replied Edward. "He command here, forest his charge. We must see it. I like, possible, notice his coming, may prepared." "You need preparation, sir, he come," replied Oswald. "Very true," said Edward; "we nothing conceal, he finds us pickle, consequence." "Rather better, sir," replied Oswald. "Let sisters wash-tub, brother carting manure; he likely suspicion otherwise assume be." "Have heard news London, Oswald?" "Not yet. I away yesterday evening, Master Heatherstone came back, I seen his man morning. While eat dinner, I go kitchen; he there, Phoebe sure tell she heard." "Do say I here, Oswald, I wish see intendant." "Mum's word, sir; must stay cottage, others see you, may come his ears." Oswald's wife put large pie, wheaten bread, biggin good beer. Edward helped Pablo large allowance, filled his platter; thus occupied, Oswald Partridge left cottage, agreed. "What say, Pablo? think walk back to-night?" "Yes; like walking night. My people always do; sleep daytime." "Well, I think better go home: Oswald one bed, I wish know I here; so, Pablo, eat heartily, shall tired. I want get home, I may send Humphrey calf." "One bed here; stay," replied Pablo. "I go home, tell Master Humphrey." "Do think would able find way, Pablo?" "Once go one way, always know way again." "You clever fellow, Pablo, I mind try you. Now drink beer. I think, Pablo, shall go home, tell Humphrey I Smoker heifer lies dead, skinned nine of the clock tomorrow morning; so, he comes, he find there." "Yes, I go now." "No, now; must rest little more." "Pablo tired," replied gipsy, getting up; "be back supper. As I go along, look calf dead cow--see calf stay mother." "Very well, then, wish it, may go now," said Edward. Pablo nodded his head disappeared. A minutes afterward, Oswald made his appearance. "Is boy gone?" "Yes; he gone back cottage;" Edward stated he killed heifer, wanted obtain calf. "I have idea find boy useful, he properly managed." "I think too," replied Edward; "and I glad perceive he already attached us. We treat ourselves." "You right; news I tell you. The Duke Hamilton, Earl Holland, Lord Capel tried, condemned, executed." Edward sighed. "More murder! must expect murdered king. Is all?" "No. King Charles Second proclaimed Scotland, invited come over." "That indeed news," replied Edward. "Where he now?" "At Hague; said he going Paris." "That heard?" "Yes; current Master Heatherstone, town. His man, Samson, gave news; he said, 'that his master's journey London oppose execution three lords; vain.'" "Well," replied Edward, pause, "if king come over, work cut us, I expect. Your news put fever," continued Edward, taking biggin drinking large draught beer. "I thought would," replied Oswald; "but time comes, quiet keep better." "Yes, Oswald; I cannot talk more; I must left alone think. I go bed, I shall early morning. Is fellow, Corbould, getting well?" "Yes, sir; he bed, walks little stick; he still lame, time." "Good-night, Oswald; I thing say, I write send boy. I want seen more." "It best, sir. Good-night; I put Smoker kennel right, he friendly dogs." Edward retired bed, sleep. The Scots proclaimed king, invited over. "He surely come," thought Edward, "and he army round soon he lands." Edward made his resolution join army, soon he hear king landed; considering he able do, afterward building castles he would do, long he fell asleep; he he dreamed battles victory--he charging head his troops--he surrounded dying dead. He wounded, he somehow well again, magic; scene changed, he rescuing Patience Heatherstone his lawless men, preserving life her father, sacrificed; last he awoke, found daylight peeped windows, he slept longer he intended do. He arose dressed quickly, and, waiting breakfast, went kennel, released Smoker his durance, set his return. Before nine of the clock, he arrived spot heifer lay dead. He found calf still side, bleating walking round uneasily. As he approached dog, went farther distance, remained. Edward took his knife commenced skinning heifer, took inside. The animal quite fresh good, fat, may supposed. While thus occupied, Smoker growled sprung forward, bounding away direction cottage, Edward thought Humphrey hand. In minutes, pony cart appeared trees, Humphrey Pablo it, Smoker leaping his friend Billy. "Good-morning, Humphrey," said Edward: "I almost ready you; question is, take calf? It wild deer." "It puzzler, without Smoker run down," said Humphrey. "I take him, Smoker," said Pablo. "How take it?" Pablo went cart, took long small cord, Humphrey brought them, made noose one end; he coiled rope his hand, threw full length, way trial. "This way I take him, suppose I get near enough. This way take bulls Spain; call Lasso. Now come me." Pablo his rope coiled his hand, went round side calf, still remained lowing two hundred yards' distance. "Now tell Smoker," cried Pablo. Humphrey set Smoker upon calf, retreated dog, presenting his head run it; Pablo kept behind animal, Smoker attacked it, drove near him. As soon calf, busy dog perceive Pablo, came sufficiently near him, Pablo threw his rope, caught loop round animal's neck. The calf set galloping toward Humphrey, dragging Pablo him, latter strong enough hold it. Humphrey went his assistance, Edward; calf thrown Smoker, seized neck, tied put cart minutes. "Well done, Pablo! clever fellow," said Edward, "and calf shall yours." "It cow calf," said Humphrey, "which I glad of. Pablo, well, and, Edward says, calf belongs you." Pablo look pleased, said nothing. The meat hide put cart, offal Alice asked dogs, set return home. Humphrey anxious go Lymington, sorry he meat take him: he determined get next morning, Edward proposed he take Pablo him, he might know way case emergency, felt Pablo could trusted. Edward said he would remain home his sisters, see he could use Alice; not, would work garden. Humphrey Pablo went away breakfast, Billy, meat skin heifer cart. Humphrey also large basket eggs three dozen chickens Alice disposed of, list long tail kite, articles she Edith required; fortunately nothing expensive list, long was--but women days required needles, pins, buttons, tapes, thread, worsted, hundred little necessaries, now. As soon gone, Edward, still castle-building, instead offering his services Alice, brought his father's sword commenced cleaning it. When he polished his satisfaction, he felt less inclined ever thing; dinner he took his gun walked forest he might indulge his reveries. He walked on, quite unconscious direction he going, finding his hat knocked branch tree he perceived--for best possible reasons, his eyes cast ground--when his ears saluted neighing horse. He looked perceived he near herd forest ponies, first he seen since he lived forest. This roused him, he looked him. "Where I wandering to?" thought Edward; "I never fell forest ponies before; I must, therefore, walked direction quite contrary I usually do. I know I am--the scenery new me. What fool I am! It is lucky nobody except Humphrey digs pitfalls, I probably one time; I have brought gun left dog home. Well, I suppose I find way back." Edward surveyed whole herd ponies, great distance him. There fine horse two among them, appeared leaders herd. They allowed Edward approach within two hundred yards, then, manes tails streaming air, darted rapidity wind. "Now I will puzzle Humphrey I go back," thought Edward. "He says Billy getting old, he wishes he could get another pony. I tell plenty are, propose he invent way catching one. That poser him; yet I am sure he try, he ingenious. And now, way I turn find way home? I think ought north; north? sun out, I perceive looks like rain. I wonder long I walking! I sure I do not know." Edward hurried direction he considered might lead homeward, walked fast; he fell his habit castle-building, talking himself: "The king proclaimed Scotland! he come course: I join his army, then--" Thus he went on, absorbed news he gained Oswald, till sudden he recollected himself, perceived he lost sight copse trees high hill, he directing his steps. Where it? He turned round round, last found he walking away it. "I must dream more," thought he, "or I indulge daydreams, I certainly shall neither sleep dream to-night. It getting dark already, I lost forest, foolishness. If stars shine, I shall know direct steps; indeed, do, I do not know whether I walked south north, I pretty pickle; I care forest night like this, sisters Humphrey alarmed absence. The best thing I do, decide upon taking straight line, continue it: I must get forest last, even I walk right across it. That better going backward forward, round round, I shall otherwise do, like puppy running alter tail. So shine out, stars!" Edward waited he could make Charles's Wain, he well knew, Polar Star. As soon he certain that, he resolved travel due north, he so, sometimes walking fast, others keeping steady trot half mile without stopping. As he proceeding his travels, he observed, trees ahead him, spark fire emitted; he thought glow-worm first, like striking flint steel; he saw second time, he stopped he might ascertain might be, he advanced farther. CHAPTER XV. It dark, moon, stars often obscured clouds, heavy borne along wind, high. The light appeared, time Edward heard clash flint steel, he quite certain somebody striking light. He advanced cautiously, arrived large tree, behind he remained reconnoiter. The people, whoever might be, thirty yards him; light spread rays moment two, he could make figure kneeling holding his hat protect wind; burned brighter, he saw lantern lighted, again, sudden, dark: Edward immediately satisfied dark lantern lighted closed. Who parties might be, he course idea; he resolved he would ascertain, he could, he accosted asked his way. "They dog," thought Edward, "or would growled this; it is lucky I none either." Edward crept softly nearer them: wind, strong, blew Edward stood, less chance hearing his approach. Edward went his hands knees, crawled fern he gained another tree, within ten yards them, he could hear might say. He thus cautious, he told Oswald many disbanded soldiers taken quarters forest, committed several depredations upon houses adjacent it, always returning forest rendezvous. Edward listened, heard one say-- "It time yet! No, no: soon half hour more. The people Lymington, buy he wants, always bring night, his retreat may discovered. They sometimes leave cottage till two hours dark, leave Lymington go till dark." "Do know supplies food?" "Yes, people inn Parliament-street--I forget sign." "Oh, I know. Yes, landlord downright Malignant his heart! We might squeeze well, dared show Lymington." "Yes, would squeeze necks tighter would agreeable, I expect," replied other. "Are sure he money?" "Quite sure; I peeped chinks window-shutters, I saw pay things brought him; canvas bag, gold he took out." "And he put bag he paid them?" "That I cannot tell, for, I knew would come soon paid, I obliged beat retreat, lest I seen." "Well, then, managed?" "We must first tap door, try get benighted travelers; will not do--and I fear not--while remain begging admittance door, keep occupied, I try door behind, leads garden; door, I try window. I examined well, outside he shut his shutters, I know fastenings. With pane out, I could open immediately." "Is body else besides cottage?" "Yes, lad attends him, goes Lymington him." "No women?" "Not one." "But think two sufficient? Had better get help? There Broom, Black gipsy, rendezvous. I go them, back time; stout true." "Stout enough, true. No, no, I want sharers business, know ill behaved last affair. I will swear produced half swag. I like honor gentlemen soldiers; that is I chosen you. I know I trust you, Benjamin. It is time now--what say? We two one, I count boy nothing. Shall start?" "I you. You say there is bag gold, that is worth fighting for." "Yes, Ben, I will tell you: I have got buried, share bag, I shall enough, I think; I will start Low Countries, England's getting rather warm me." "Well, I shall not go yet," replied Benjamin. "I do not like foreign parts; good ale, I cannot understand talk. I would sooner remain jolly old England halter twisted ready me, pass life set chaps, drink nothing scheidam, wear twenty pair breeches. Come, let us off; get money, shall go Low Countries, Will, I will start North, do not know me; go, I will not stay here." The two men rose up; one whose name appeared Will first examined candle his dark lantern burned well; set off, followed Edward, heard quite enough satisfy bent upon burglary, murder. Edward followed them, keep forms indistinctly sight, much he could twenty yards' distance; fortunately wind high hear his footsteps, although he often trod upon rotten stick, snapped broke twain. As near Edward could guess, he tracked three miles, stopped, he perceived examining pistols, took belts. They went again, entered small plantation oak-trees, forty years' growth--very thick dark, close underwood below. They followed narrow path, came cleared place middle plantation, stood low cottage, surrounded covert every side, exception thirty yards land around it. All still, dark pitch; Edward remained behind trees, two men stopped, he six feet them. They consulted low tone wind high he could distinguish said. At last advanced cottage, Edward, still keeping within trees, shifted his position, he opposite gable end cottage. He observed one man go front door, went round door behind, agreed. Edward threw open pan lock gun, reprimed it, he might sure, waited follow. He heard man Will front door, talking asking shelter plaintive loud voice; shortly afterward he perceived light chinks shutters--for Edward continually altering his position see going front back. At one time, he thought leveling his gun killing one men once; he could make his mind that, burglary, although intended, yet committed; he remained passive attack really made, he resolved he would come rescue. After minutes entreaty would open door, man front commenced thumping beating it, he would make open door force; attract attention within, divert attempts making get behind. Edward aware this; he kept his eye upon going back. Advancing nearer--which he ventured men occupied--he perceived fellow contrived open window close back door, remaining quite close pistol his hand, apparently wishing run risk climbing in. Edward slipped eaves cottage, six feet man, remained his back partly turned him. Edward then, finding he obtained position unperceived, crouched his gun ready pointed. As Edward remained position, he heard shrill voice cry out, "They getting behind!" movement cottage. The man near him, his pistol his hand, put his arm window fired inside. A shriek given, Edward fired his gun body man, immediately fell. Edward lost time reloading his gun, he heard bursting open front door report firearms; silent moment, excepting wailing somebody within. As soon his gun reloaded, Edward walked round front cottage, he found man called Ben, lying across threshold open door. He stepped across body, and, looking room within, perceived body stretched floor, young lad weeping it. "Do not alarmed, I friend," said Edward, going body lay; and, taking light farther end chamber, he placed floor, he might examine state person, breathing heavily, apparently badly wounded. "Rise up, lad," said Edward, "and let see I use." "Ah, no!" cried boy, throwing back his long hair his temples, "he bleeds death!" "Bring water, quick," said Edward, "there is good lad, I see he hurt." The boy ran fetch water, Edward discovered ball entered neck collar-bone, blood poured man's mouth, choking effusion. Although ignorant surgery, Edward thought wound must mortal; man alive sensible, although he could utter word, he spoke his eyes signs. He raised his hand pointed first, shook his head, say him; he turned round his head, looking lad, returning water. When lad knelt his side, weeping bitterly, man pointed him, gave imploring look Edward immediately comprehended he wished: ask protection boy. It could misunderstood, could Edward otherwise promise dying man? His generous nature could refuse it, he said, "I understand you; wish take care boy gone. Is so?" The man signified assent. "I promise I so. I take family, he shall share us." The man raised his hand again, gleam joy passed his features, he took hand lad put Edward. His eyes fixed upon Edward scrutinize his character his features, former bathed his temples washed blood his mouth water brought boy, appeared state grief violent paralyze his senses. After minute two, another effusion blood choked wounded man, who, short struggle, fell back dead. "He gone!" thought Edward, "and done? I must first ascertain whether two villains dead not. Edward took light examined body Ben, lying threshold door; man quite dead, ball entered his brain. He proceeding round outside cottage examine state man, he shot himself; wind nearly blew light, he therefore returned chamber placed floor, near boy lay insensible corpse man died arms Edward; went without light, his gun, side cottage, robber fallen. As he approached man, faint voice heard say-- "Ben, Ben! water, love God! Ben, I am done for!" Edward, without giving answer, went back room water, he took round man, put his lips; he felt he bound humanity dying man, scoundrel though he might be. It still dark, dark previously been, late moon rising. The man drank water eagerly, said, "Ben, I speak now, I shall not long." He pulled basin toward again, he drank, ho said, broken sentences, "I feel--that I am bleeding--to death--inside." Then he paused. "You know oak--struck lightning--a mile north--of this. Oh! I am going fast. Three yards south--I buried my--money; it is yours. Oh! another drink!" The man attempted drink basin proffered Edward, he made attempt, he fell back groan. Edward perceiving he dead, returned cottage look lad, still remained prostrate embracing corpse chamber. Edward reflected upon best done. After time, he decided upon dragging away body robber named Ben outside threshold, securing door. This, trouble, he effected, he made fast window forced open behind. Before he removed boy, lay his face buried corpse, appeared state insensibility, Edward examined corpse lay. Although plainly dressed, yet evident body rustic; features fair, beard carefully cut; hands white, fingers long, evidently never employed labor. That body superior person disguised rustic, evident, corroborated conversation took place two robbers. "Alas!" thought Edward, "the family Arnwood appear people disguise forest. That poor boy! he must remain there." Edward looked round, perceived bed adjoining room, door open; he lifted boy, carried him, still insensible, room, laid bed. He went water, he found threw his face, poured little his mouth. Gradually boy stirred, recovered his stupor, Edward held water his mouth, made drink some, he did; then, suddenly aroused recollection passed, boy gave shriek woe, burst paroxysm tears. This ended convulsive sobbings low moanings. Edward felt he could present, would better he left time give vent his grief. Edward sat stool side orphan, remained time deep melancholy thought. "How strange," thought he last, "it is, I feel little I now, surrounded death, compared I good old Jacob Armitage died! Then I felt deeply, awe death. Now I longer dread it. Is I loved good old man, felt I lost friend? No, because; I may felt grief, awe dread. Or first time I seen death, first sight death occasions awe? every day I fancied battle-field, hundreds lying dead wounded around me, dreamings? I know not. Poor old Jacob died peaceably his bed, like good Christian trusting, blameless life, find mercy his Savior. Two dead, three, been, summoned away height wickedness, commission crime; third foully murdered, three lying dead, one fallen hand, yet I feel much I attended couch, listened parting words dying Christian! I cannot account it, reason why; I know so, I look upon death unconcerned. Well, kind preparation wholesale murder horrors battlefield, I long sighed for: God forgive I wrong! And poor boy! I promised protect him, I will. Could I fail promise, I imaging spirit his father (as I presume he was) looking upbraiding me. No, no, I protect him. I brother sisters preserved protected, I indeed vile I others I done by. And let reflect done. I must take boy away, bury bodies; person friends Lymington, come here. The murder taken place forest: I must let intendant know occurred. I send Oswald; Humphrey shall go. Poor fellow! state anxiety must he little sisters in, returning home! I quite forgotten that, helped. I wait till sunrise, see boy himself, probably I shall able find part forest I in." Edward took candle went room he laid boy bed. He found sound sleep. "Poor fellow," said Edward, "he time forgotten his misery. What beautiful boy he is! I long know his history. Sleep on, poor fellow! service." Edward returned room, recollected, or, rather, reminded, he supper, nearly dawn day. He looked cupboard found plenty provisions, flasks wine. "I earned supper," thought he, "and I not, therefore, deny myself." So ho brought viands flask wine, made hearty meal. "It long since I tasted wine," thought he, "and maybe long ere I drink again. I little relish now: fiery palate. I recollect, child, father used table, give stoup claret, I could hardly lift lips, drink health king." The memory king raised thoughts Edward's mind, he sunk one his reveries, lasted till he fell slumber. When he woke up, voice boy, his sleep cried "Father!" Edward started up, found sun hour high, he must slept time. He gently opened cottage door, looked bodies two men, walked survey locality cottage, he faintly made night. He found surrounded thicket trees underwood, close thick appeared outlet direction. "What place concealment!" thought Edward, "but still prowling thieves discovered it. Why, troops horse might scour forest months, never discover hiding-place." Edward walked round side thicket, find track robbers entered he followed them, last succeeded so. He followed path thicket he clear it, forest; scenery outside unknown him, he idea part forest in. "I must question boy," thought Edward. "I go back wake up, time I moving." As he turning thicket, he heard dog giving tongue, scent. It came nearer nearer him, Edward remained see might be. In moment more, he perceived his dog, Smoker, come bounding neighboring copse, followed Humphrey Pablo. Edward hallooed. Smoker sprung toward him, leaping up, loading caresses, another moment he Humphrey's arms. "Oh, Edward, let first thank God!" said Humphrey, tears started rolled his cheeks. "What night passed! What happened? That dear fellow, Pablo, thought putting Smoker scent; he brought jacket showed Smoker, gave smell, led along till he footsteps; dog followed him, seems, although round round every direction, till last he brought us you." Edward shook hands Pablo, thanked him. "How far cottage, Humphrey?" "About eight miles, I say, Edward; more." "Well, I much tell you, I must tell words I go farther, afterward I tell detail." Edward gave succinct narration occurred, and, thus prepared Humphrey Pablo see, led way back thicket cottage inside it. Humphrey Pablo much shocked scene slaughter presented eyes; and, viewed bodies, began consult best done. The proposal Edward, Humphrey go make known circumstances Oswald, might communicated intendant, readily acceded to; Pablo, agreed, go home tell Alice Edith Edward safe. "But now, Humphrey, boy; leave here." "Where he?" "He still sleeps, I believe. The question is, whether ride pony, walk, leave Pablo return pony cart; I take boy away, leave house myself, without removing property belongs boy, I make inquiry he awakes. Besides, money, robbers stated hearing, course must taken care him." "I think best walk over, Edward. If I ride, I arrive late afternoon thing done till next morning, I walk I shall time enough; settled. Besides, give time remove boy's property, which, his father probability Malignant, denounced man, might think right secure government." "Very true; so. Do start intendant's; and, Pablo, go home fetch pony cart, I remain boy, get every thing ready." Humphrey Pablo set off, Edward went waken boy, still lying bed. "Come, must get now. You know what is done undone; good boy, read Bible, must know must submit God, kind father heaven." "Ah me!" said boy, awake Edward went him; "I know well duty, hard duty, I heartbroken. I lost father, friend I world; love cherish now? What become me!" "I promised father, he died, I would take care you, poor fellow; promise sacred me, even made dying man. I best, depend upon it, I known want find protector. You shall live brother sisters, shall have." "Have sisters, then?" replied boy. "Yes; I sent cart take away this, to-night shall cottage; tell me--I ask father was, he living secret, I found I overheard robbers say one another--but long lived here?" "More year." "Whose cottage it?" "My father bought he came, he thought safer so, he might discovered betrayed; he escaped prison condemned death Parliament." "Then he loyal man his king?" "Yes, he was, his crime." "Then fear not, good boy; loyal well he was, never otherwise. I tell may safely trust us. Now, cottage his, furniture property his also?" "Yes, his." "And yours, not?" "I suppose so," said boy, bursting tears. "Then listen me: father safe persecution now; he is, I trust, heaven; touch, done nothing offend them; still take possession father's property soon know his death, find he was. This, sake I wish prevent doing, therefore sent cart, I may remove cottage every thing value, may held benefit; day another may require it. The murder committed forest, I witness and, moreover, shot one robbers, I considered right send intendant forest, give notice taken place within his jurisdiction. I think he bad man rest; still, he comes here, he may consider his duty take possession every thing Parliament, I doubt his orders, he communicates Parliament. Now robbery I wish prevent, carrying away property come over, to-morrow; I propose shall accompany me, take away, may useful, evening." "You kind," replied boy. "I wish, I feel weak, unwell." "You must exert yourself, sake, poor fellow. Come, now, sit put clothes together. Collect every thing room, I look house. And tell me, father money? robbers said saw counting sack, chinks shutters, made attack." "Hateful money!" cried boy. "Yes, he had, I believe, great deal money; I say much." "Now get up, I request, dear boy," said Edward, raising his arms; "when grief lessened, may many happy days yet store you; Father heaven must put trust in, find peace." The boy rose up, Edward closed door chamber he might see his father's corpse. "I put trust Heaven, good sir," replied boy; "for already sent kind friend distress. You good, I sure; I see face. Alas! much wretched would condition fortunately come assistance! late indeed save poor father, late succor console his child. I go away you, I stay here." CHAPTER XVI. Edward took counterpane bed, went next room. He gently drew body corner room, covered counterpane, proceeded examine cupboards, etc. In one he found good store books, another linen sorts, great many curious arms, two suits bright armor worn times, pistols, guns, ammunition. On floor one cupboards iron chest two feet eighteen inches. It locked. Edward immediately concluded chest held money unfortunate man; key? Most likely his person.

He tried one keys, appeared right size, lock iron chest, found fitted it. Satisfied this, he raise lid chest, dragged center room. There many things value room; candlesticks silver, goblets metal.

He afterward went another small room, he found sundry small trunks cases locked up. These he brought without examining, he presumed contained value, would locked. When he collected every thing, he found he already cart could carry one trip; he wanted take bedding him, he spare bed cottage give boy. Edward decided his mind he would take valuable articles away night, return cart remainder early following morning. It past noon, Edward took cupboard victuals left, went chamber boy was, begged he would eat something. The poor boy said he appetite; Edward insisted last prevailed upon eat bread drink glass wine, proved great service him. The poor fellow shuddered he saw body covered corner room, said nothing. Edward trying make eat little more, Pablo made his appearance door. "Have put want bedchamber?" said Edward. "Yes, I put every thing." "Then bring out. Come, Pablo, must help us." Pablo made signs, pointed door. Edward went out. "First pull body away this." "Yes," replied Edward, "we must so."

Edward went chamber, brought packages boy made up, put cart loaded high up; brought blankets, laid keep things steady; Edward told boy ready, better go.

The boy knelt down, kissed forehead cold lips, covered face again, rose wept bitterly Edward's shoulder. Edward attempt check his sorrow, he thought better vent; but, time, he led boy degrees till cottage. "Now then," said Edward, "we must go, shall late. My poor little sisters dreadfully alarmed come home last night, I long clasp arms." "Indeed must," replied boy, wiping away his tears, "and I selfish; let us go on." "No room cart get wood," said Pablo; "hard work, cart empty--more hard work, cart full." And proved be; required united efforts Billy, Edward, Pablo force passage cart narrow pathway; last effected, went quick pace, less two hours cottage sight. When within two hundred yards it, Edith, watch, came bounding out, flew Edward's arms, covered kisses. "You naughty Edward, frighten us so!" "Look, Edith, I brought nice little playfellow. Welcome him, dearest." Edith extended her hand she looked boy's face. "He pretty boy, Edward, much prettier Pablo." "No, Missy Edith," said Pablo; "Pablo man he." "Yes, may man, Pablo; pretty." "And Alice?" "She getting supper ready, I tell her I saw coming, I wanted first kiss." "You little jealous thing! comes Alice. Dear Alice, uneasy, fault," said Edward, kissing her. "If I I was, poor boy would killed well his father. Make welcome, Alice, he orphan now, must live us. I brought many things cart, tomorrow bring more, bed him, to-night he must sleep me." "We make happy can, Edward; sisters him," said Alice, looking boy, blushing deeply. "How old you, name?" "I shall thirteen years old next January," replied boy. "And Christian name?" "I tell by-and-by," replied he, confused. They arrived cottage, Edward Pablo busy unpacking cart, putting contents inner chamber, Pablo slept, Alice, who, Edith, talking boy, came Edward said, "Edward, she is girl!" "A girl!" replied Edward, astonished. "Yes, she told so, wished tell you." "But she wear boys' clothes?" "It her father's wish, he often obliged send her Lymington friend's house, he afraid her getting trouble; she told her story yet--she says she to-night." "Well, then," replied Edward, "you must make bed her room to-night. Take Pablo's bed, he shall sleep me. To-morrow morning I bring bedding her cottage." "How Humphrey surprised he comes back!" said Alice, laughing.. "Yes; she make nice little wife years hence; she may prove heiress, perhaps, iron chest money it." Alice returned her new companion, Edward Pablo continued unload cart. "Well, Pablo, I suppose allow that, know she girl, she handsomer you?" "Oh yes," replied Pablo, "very handsome girl; much girl handsome boy." At last every thing cart, iron chest dragged Pablo's room, Billy put his stable given his supper, he well earned, cart heavily loaded. They sat supper, Edward saying new acquaintance, "So I find I another sister instead another brother. Now tell name?" "Yes; Clara name." "And tell girl?"

After supper over, busied making arrangements her sleeping room, went prayers. "We much thankful for, dears," said Edward. "I sure I feel I great danger, I wish I useful I been; God, must arraign his decrees. Let us return thanks his great mercies, bow submission his dispensations, pray he give peace poor little Clara, soften her affliction." And Edward prayed, little Clara knelt sobbed, Alice caressed her her arm round her waist, stopped times her prayer kiss console her. When finished, Alice led her away her bedroom, followed Edith, put her bed. Edward Pablo also retired, worn fatigue excitement day. They following morning day-dawn, and, putting Billy cart, set cottage Clara. They found every thing left it, and, loaded cart left behind day before, bedding two beds, several articles furniture Edward thought might useful, still little room left, Edward packed up, wooden case dried fern, wine cupboard; and, assisted Pablo forcing cart path wood, he left return home cart, he remained wait arrival Humphrey, whoever might come intendant's. About ten of the clock, he watching outside wood, he perceived several people approaching him, soon made Humphrey, intendant, Oswald among number. When came him, Edward saluted intendant respectful manner, shook hands Oswald, led way narrow path led wood cottage. The intendant horseback, rest foot. The intendant left his horse care one verderers, went wood foot rest party, preceded Edward. He appeared grave thoughtful, Edward thought coolness his manner toward himself--for must recollected Mr. Heatherstone seen Edward since he rendered service saving life his daughter. The consequence Edward felt somewhat indignant; he express his feelings, his looks even, conveyed party silence cottage. On arrival, Edward pointed body robber, covered fern, verderers exposed it. "By whose hand man fall?" said intendant. "By hand party lived cottage." Edward led way round back cottage robber lay-- "And man slain hand," replied Edward. "We one body see," continued Edward, leading way cottage, uncovering corpse Clara's father. Mr. Heatherstone looked face appeared much moved. "Cover up," said he, turning away; sitting chair close table-- "And found?" he said. "I neither saw person killed, robber first saw, I heard report firearms almost moment, I presume fell other's hands." The intendant called his clerk, accompanied him, desired get ready his writing materials, said-- "Edward Armitage, take deposition occurred." Edward commenced stating, "that he forest lost his way, seeking path home." "You forest night? "Yes, sir, I was." "With gun?" "I always carry gun," replied Edward. "In pursuit game?" "No, sir; I not. I never pursuit game night-time life." "What about? go nothing?" "I went commune thoughts; I restless, I wandered without knowing I went, reason I lost way." "And pray may excited you?" "I tell you: I Oswald Partridge day before; arrived London, he gave news King Charles proclaimed Scotland, news unsettled me." "Well, proceed." Edward met interruption his narrative. He stated briefly taken place, time he fell robbers till winding catastrophe. The clerk took Edward stated, read ascertain he written correctly, inquired Edward "if he could read write?" "I hope so," replied Edward, taking pen signing his name. The clerk stared, said--"People condition often know read write, Mr. Forester, therefore need offended question." "Very true," replied Edward. "May I ask presence considered longer necessary?" "You stated boy house, young man," said intendant: "what become him?" "He removed cottage." "Why so?" "Because his father died I promised I would take care his child; I intend keep word." "You spoken him, then, he died?" said intendant. "Not so; carried signs his part, intelligible he spoke, I replied he well understood; I really think I removed great anxiety his mind giving promise." The intendant paused, said--"I perceive articles removed--the bedding, instance--have taken thing away?" "I removed bedding, I bed offer lad, he told cottage furniture belonged his father; course his father's death became his, I felt I warranted doing." "May I ask, remove papers?" "I tell; lad packed his things; boxes removed, locked up, contents wholly unknown. I could leave boy scene death, I could well leave property belonging mercy plunderers forest. I I considered right benefit boy, accordance solemn promise I made his father." "Still property removed. The party lies dead well-known Malignant." "How know that, sir?" interrupted Edward; "did recognize saw body?" "I say I did," replied intendant. "You either must done, sir." replied Edward, "or must aware he residing cottage: choose between." "You bold, young man," replied intendant, "and I reply observation. I recognize party I saw his face, I knew one condemned death, escaped prison days one appointed his execution. I heard search made him, vain, supposed he escaped beyond seas. Now his papers may means giving Parliament information others well himself." "And enable commit murders," added Edward. "Silence, young man; authorities must spoken irreverent manner. Are aware language treasonable?" "According act Parliament, present constituted, may be," replied Edward, "but loyal subject King Charles Second, I deny it." "I concern loyalty, young man, I admit language uttered presence ruling powers. The inquest over. Let every one leave house except Edward Armitage, I would speak alone." "Excuse one moment, sir," said Edward, "and I return." Edward went rest, and, calling Humphrey aside, said him, "Contrive slip away unperceived; keys; haste cottage fast can; look though papers find packages taken there; bury iron chest garden, anywhere discovered." Humphrey nodded turned away, Edward re-entered cottage. He found intendant standing corpse; he removed coverlid, looking mournfully face disfigured blood. Perceiving entrance Edward, he took his seat table, pause said, "Edward Armitage, brought superior station life certain; loyal, bold, resolute equally so; put obligation I never repay, even allowed exert behalf. I take opportunity acknowledging it; allow say, that, times, much frank impetuous. This time people give vent feelings opinions. Even I much surrounded spies others, obliged behave accordingly. Your avowed attachment king's prevented showing cordiality I really feel you, every way entitled." "I conceal opinions, sir; I brought house loyal Cavalier, never otherwise." "Granted--why be? see harm good thus avowing opinions avowal useless? If every man county, opinion, express himself, hopeless, done, prisons would crowded, executions would dayly, would be, proportion, weakened loss daring. 'Bide time' good motto, I recommend you. You must feel that, however may variance opinions, Edward Armitage, hand authority never used one I indebted; and, feeling this, compel me, presence others, use harshness coldness toward you, contrary, wholly contrary, what, may believe I say it, I really feel one nobly rescued child." "I thank you, sir, advice, I feel good, good opinion, I value." "And I feel deserve; shall have, young are, confidence, I know abuse. I know man lies dead us, I also know he concealed cottage; Major Ratcliffe one earliest dearest friends, unhappy civil war, never difference us, even afterward politics, espoused. I knew, I came intendant, his place concealment was, anxious his safety." "Excuse me, Mr. Heatherstone, day I find make like I day before; first I felt inimical; I wonder leagued party are." "Edward Armitage, I answer thousands more. You young man known insurrection, or, rather, opposition, unfortunate King Charles. He attempted make absolute, wrest liberties people England: his warmest adherents admit. When I joined party opposed him, I little thought matters would carried far been; I always considered lawful take arms defense liberties, time I equally felt person king sacred." "I heard so, sir." "Yes, truth; never people strive zealously prevent murder king--for murder was--than relative Ashley Cooper myself--so much so, indeed, incurred suspicion ill-will Cromwell, who, I fear, making rapid advances toward absolute authority king suffered, he would vest his person. I considered just; and, power left hands would exercised discretion moderation, king would even throne, liberties his subjects sacred; easier put vast powerful engine motion stop it, case unfortunate civil war. Thousands took active part king will, opportunity ripe, retrace steps; I expect much suffer time come. And now, Edward Armitage, I said I person breathing, except kinsman." "I thank confidence, sir, betrayed, act warning guide future conduct." "I meant should. Be longer rash careless avowing opinions. You good because, may much harm. And I must ask another question, I could people. You surprised stating Major Ratcliffe son here; must mistake, boy must impostor. He daughter, daughter, I have; he never son." "It mistake I fell into, sir, finding boy here, I stated inquest; I considered boy, I brought her home, she discovered sisters she girl dressed boys' clothes. I give explanation inquest, necessary." "I right, then. I must relieve charge, Edward Armitage; she shall daughter, I trust agree me, without disparagement feelings, house fit residence her cottage." "I prevent her going, she wishes it, explanation confidence, Mr. Heatherstone." "One thing more. As I said before, Edward Armitage, I believe many verderers, selected army, spies upon me: I must therefore careful. You said aware papers?" "I saw none, sir; I suspect, many locked-up trunks small boxes, may be; I went others inquest, I dispatched brother Humphrey cottage, advising open locks remove papers he might find." The intendant smiled. "Well, case, go cottage make examination. We shall find nothing, I shall performed duty. I aware brother here. I presume young man walked Oswald Partridge." "It was, sir." "By his appearance, I presume he, also, brought Arnwood?" "He was, sir, well I," replied Edward. "Well, then, I one word say--recollect, I appear harsh severe presence others, assumed toward you, real. You understand that?" "I do, sir, beg exercise discretion." The intendant went said party, "It appears I extract lad Armitage, boxes he removed his cottage; go see may contain. It noon. Have refreshment offer us cottage, young man, arrive?" "I keep hostelry, sir," replied Edward, somewhat gloomily; "my labor brother's sufficient support family, more." "Let us move on; two keep eye upon young man," said intendant aside. They proceeded wood; intendant mounted his horse, set cottage, arrived two of the clock afternoon. CHAPTER XVII. Humphrey came soon he perceived intendant his party approaching, whispered Edward safe. The intendant dismounted, ordering every body his clerk wait outside, ushered cottage Edward. Alice, Edith, Pablo room; two girls little flushed frightened unusual appearance large party strangers. "These sisters, sir," said Edward. "Where Clara, Alice?" "She alarmed, gone bedroom." "I hope alarmed presence," said intendant, looking earnestly two girls. "It duty obliges pay visit; nothing fear. Now, Edward Armitage, must produce boxes packages took cottage." "I will, sir," replied Edward, "and keys. Humphrey, Pablo bring out." The boxes brought out, opened, examined intendant his clerk, course papers found them. "I must send two people search house," said intendant. "Had better go little girl, she may frightened?" "I go her," said Alice. Two people, assisted clerk, searched house; found nothing worthy notice, except weapons armor Edward removed, he stated intendant he took away valuable property belonging little girl. "It sufficient," said intendant his clerk; "undoubtedly papers; I must, I go, interrogate child removed thus; she frightened, I shall obtain answer her, many, let every body leave cottage I speak her." The clerk others left cottage, intendant desired Edward bring Clara bedroom. She came out, accompanied clinging indeed Alice, she much alarmed. "Come here, Clara," said intendant, gently; "you know perhaps I sincere friend; father dead, I want come live daughter, delighted companion. Will go me, I take care father you?" "I like leave Alice Edith; treat kindly, call sister," replied Clara, sobbing. "I sure do, must fond already, still duty come me; father could speak now, he would tell so. I force away; remember, born lady, must brought educated lady, case cottage, although kind you, nice young people. You recollect me, Clara; often sat knee little girl father lived Dorsetshire. You recollect great walnut-tree sitting-room window, looked garden; do not you?" "Yes," replied Clara, surprise. "Yes, I too, used sit knee; remember Jason, big mastiff, used ride upon his back?" "Yes," replied Clara, "I do; he died long ago." "He did, six years old. And tell me, old gardener bury him?" "Under mulberry-tree," replied Clara. "Yes, he did, I poor Jason buried. You do not recollect me. But I take hat, I wear dress I now. Now look, Clara, see remember me." Clara, longer alarmed, looked intendant's face, said, "You called father Philip, he used call Charles." "You right, sweet one," replied intendant, pressing Clara his bosom; "I so, great friends. Now, come me? I little girl, older three four years, companion, love dearly." "May I come see Alice Edith sometimes?" "Yes, shall, she come make acquaintance, brother permit it. I take away now, dearest; shall remain days, come fetch you. I send Oswald Partridge let know day, Edward Armitage, come her. Good-by, dear Clara; good-by, little girls. Humphrey Armitage, good-by. Who lad here?" "He gipsy Humphrey trapped his pitfall, sir, soon tamed him," replied Edward. "Well, then, Edward Armitage, good-by," said intendant, extending his hand him, "we must meet soon again." The intendant went cottage, joined his people outside. Edward went him; intendant mounted his horse, he said coldly Edward, "I shall keep sharp look-out proceedings, sir, depend upon it; I tell decidedly, fare well." With words intendant put spurs his horse, rode away. "What made speak sharply you, Edward?" said Humphrey. "Because he means kindly, want people know it," replied Edward. "Come in, Humphrey; I much tell much surprise with." "I surprised already," replied Humphrey. "How Roundhead know Clara's father well?" "I explain go bed," replied Edward; "let us go now." The two brothers long conversation evening, Edward made Humphrey acquainted passed intendant. "It is opinion, Edward," said Humphrey, "that he thinks matters carried far, he sorry he belongs Parliamentary party. He finds out, late, he allied different feelings motives his own, assisted put power hands scruples he has." "Yes, ridding one tyranny, considered it, every prospect falling hands greater tyrant before; for, depend upon it, Cromwell assume sovereign power, rule kingdom rod iron." "Well, many are, I doubt, soon be, his opinion; time come, sooner later, king his again. They proclaimed Scotland already. Why he come show himself? His presence would, I think, induce thousands flock him; I am sure would me." "I glad good intelligence intendant, Edward, necessary us careful; may go come please. I almost wish could persuaded accept eligible offer he may make you. Many, doubt, office, serving present government, feelings intendant, even feelings strong own." "I bear idea accepting thing instruments, Humphrey; nor, indeed, could I leave sisters." "On score may make mind easy: Pablo I quite sufficient farm, thing else may want do. If useful elsewhere, scruple leaving us. If king come raise army, would leave us, course; I see reason why, eligible offer made you, now. You talents thrown away forest; might serve king king's better going world watching times ever killing his venison." "Certainly," replied Edward, laughing, "I much help his killing his deer, must admitted; I shall say this, thing offered I accept without injury feelings honor, I shall decline it, provided I may, accepting it, prove service king's because." "That I wish, Edward. And I think better go bed." The next day dug iron chest box Humphrey put papers he collected together. Edward opened iron chest, found considerable quantity gold bags, many trinkets jewels he know value of. The papers he open, resolved given intendant, Edward felt he could trust him. The boxes trunks also opened examined, many articles apparent value discovered. "I think jewels worth great deal money, Humphrey," said Edward; "if so, better poor little Clara. I sorry part her, although known her short time; she appears amiable affectionate child." "That she is; certainly handsomest little girl I ever saw. What beautiful eyes! Do know one her journeys Lymington she nearly taken party gipsies? Pablo make out, would appear party he belonged." "I wonder her father permitting her go alone distance." "Her father could otherwise. Necessity law. He could trust person, he put her boys' clothes might less risk. Still, she must intelligent done office." "She thirteen years old, although she small," replied Edward. "And intelligent she certainly is, may see her countenance. Who would ever imagined sisters would able now? It is old saying, 'We never know till try.' By-the-by Humphrey, I met famous herd forest ponies day, I said myself, 'I wonder whether Humphrey clever enough take one them, he wild cattle?' For Billy getting old, want successor." "We want successor Billy, Edward: want two help him--and I means maintaining two ponies I could catch them." "I fear never manage that, Humphrey," said Edward, laughing. "I know well mean," replied Humphrey: "you wish dare it--well. I will not dared thing, I certainly try catch pony two; I must think first, I arranged plan mind, I make attempt." "When I see ponies yard, I believe it, Humphrey. They wild deer fleet wind, catch pitfall." "I know that, good brother; I say is, I try I do, I more--but present, I busy." Three days conversation, Oswald Partridge made his appearance, sent intendant tell Edward he come following day take away little Clara. "And she go?" said Edward. "He bring little nag her, she ride--if she not, she must ride cart come baggage." "Clara, ride horse?" "Yes," replied Clara, "if jump much. I always rode one I lived Dorsetshire." "This will not jump about, little lady," said Oswald, "for he thirty years old, I believe, steady old gentleman ought be." "I conversation Master Heatherstone," continued Oswald Edward. "He much pleased you, I tell you. He said times like he required young men like him; that, would take berth verderer, he must find one better suited you; he said good office." "Many thanks his good opinion," replied Edward; "but I think he office his gift I accept." "So I thought, I said nothing. He asked many questions relative old Jacob Armitage, he pressed hard. He said Humphrey much his position appearance were, he brought Arnwood, he presumed he advantages. And he said--'But his two sisters brought Arnwood also?' I replied, I believed not, although often there, allowed play children house. He looked steadfastly, he would read thoughts, went writing. I help thinking he suspicion grandchildren old Jacob; time I think he idea really are." "You must keep secret, Oswald," replied Edward. "I good opinion intendant, I acknowledge; I trust nobody." "As I hope future mercy, sir, I never divulge bid me," replied Oswald. "I trust you, Oswald, there is end matter. But tell me, Oswald, say his taking charge little girl?" "Why, begin talk it; he gave order Parliament child remain directions, course said nothing, dared not. It seems Ratcliffe property sequestrated, yet granted one; Parliament likely, soon she old enough, give her wife, property, one party; done now, secures property changes." "I perceive," replied Edward. "When hear little girl live him?" "Not till yesterday morning; till evening knew order Parliament." Edward think right tell Oswald he knew, secret confided intendant, therefore merely observed--"I presumed child would permitted remain hands;" conversation dropped. As Oswald informed them, intendant made his appearance forenoon following day, accompanied his daughter, rode his side. A groom, horse, led pony Clara ride; cart luggage followed distance. Edward went assist Miss Heatherstone dismount, she frankly extended her hand she reached ground. Edward little surprised well pleased, condescension her part toward forester. "You much honor, Mistress Patience," said he, bowing. "I forget I owe life you, Master Armitage," replied Patience, "and I grateful. May I request another favor you?" "Certainly, power wish." "It this," said she, low voice--"that hastily reject overtures may made father; all. And let go see sisters, father praised much, I wish know them." Edward led way cottage, Patience followed him, intendant conversation Humphrey. Edward, introduced his sisters Clara, went pay his respects intendant, who, alone, candid toward Humphrey. Edward told intendant iron chest good deal money it, jewels also, many articles value boxes. "I fear, sir, cart hardly hold goods." "I intend take away heavy bulky articles, bedding, armor, &c. I take Clara's packages, valuables papers. The remainder may stay here, use, till demanded you. Where Oswald Partridge?" "In stable horses, sir," replied Humphrey. "Then, cart loaded--and better done men stable--Oswald shall take charge it, take things house." "Here keys, sir," said Edward, presenting them. "Good. And now, Edward Armitage, alone, I want little conversation you. You aware much I feel indebted service rendered me, anxious I show gratitude. You born better things remain obscure forester, perhaps deer-stalker. I offer make you, I trust, upon reflection, refuse--and I say reflection, I wish give answer till well reflected. I know accept thing present government; private situation raise objection to; as, far leaving family, position protect them. I want secretary, I wish accept office, live entirely house, receive handsome salary services, not, I trust, heavy. You near family cottage, able protect assist them; more, mix world know going on, I confidence government. Of course, I put implicit confidence you, I would offer situation. But always here: I correspondents friends, I shall send occasionally trusty missions. You, I sure, suit every respect, I hope undertake post I offer you. Give answer now; consult brother, give offer due consideration, made mind let know." Edward bowed, intendant went cottage. Edward assisted Humphrey Pablo get iron chest cart, covered packages boxes, till cart well loaded. Leaving Pablo charge till Oswald came stables, Edward Humphrey went cottage, found social party; Patience Heatherstone succeeded making great friends three girls, intendant, Edward's surprise, laughing joking them. Alice Edith brought milk, biscuits, fruit ripe, bread, cold piece salt beef, ham; eating well talking. "I praising sisters' house-keeping, Armitage," said intendant. "Your farm appears productive." "Alice expected Miss Heatherstone, sir," replied Edward, "and made unusual provision. You must think live fare every day." "No," replied intendant, dryly; "on days I dare say fare. I would almost make bet pasty cupboard dare show intendant New Forest." "You mistaken, sir, once," replied Humphrey. "Alice knows well make one, she one now." "Well, I must believe you, Master Humphrey," replied intendant. "And now, dear child, must think going, long ride, little girl used horse." "Mistress Alice, many thanks hospitality; now, farewell. Edith, good-by, dear. Now, Clara, quite ready?" They went cottage. The intendant put Clara pony, she kissed Alice Edith. Edward assisted Patience; she mounted, she said-- "I hope accept father's offer--you oblige much do." "I give every consideration deserves," replied Edward. "Indeed, depend upon brother whether I accept not." "Your brother sensible young man, sir; therefore, I hopes," replied Patience. "A quality appears give credit for, Miss Heatherstone." "Not pride vindictive feelings obtain mastery," replied she. "Perhaps find I quite proud, bear ill-will, I I first saw father, Miss Heatherstone; allowance made, even I show feelings, consider I brought Arnwood." "True--most true, Master Armitage. I right speak boldly, especially you, risked life save daughter one Roundheads treated family protector cruelly. You must forgive me; now, farewell!" Edward bowed, turned intendant, apparently waiting conversation going on. The intendant bade cordial farewell; Edward shook Clara hand, cavalcade set off. They remained outside cottage till party distance, Edward walked apart Humphrey, communicate offer made intendant, ask his opinion. "My opinion made up, Edward, accept immediately. You obligation government, already conferred obligation upon intendant right expect return. Why stay here, safely mix world know things going on? I require assistance, I Pablo, useful every day. Do lose opportunity making friend us--a protector, I may say--and is, he confided you, thing approving conduct present government. He paid deserved compliment saying he trust you. You must refuse offer, Edward--it would really folly did." "I believe right, Humphrey; I accustomed range forest--I fond chase--I impatient control confinement, I hardly know decide. A secretary's life thing pleasing me, sitting table writing reading day long. The pen poor exchange long-barreled gun." "It execution, nevertheless," replied Humphrey, "if I read true. But suppose life sedentary one. Did he say he would trust missions importance? Will not, going London places, mixing people importance, preparing proper station life, I trust one day resume? And follow, appointed secretary, go forest shoot deer Oswald, feel inclined--with difference, may without fear insulted persecuted wretch Corbould? Do hesitate longer, dear brother; recollect sisters ought live forest life advance years--they born it, although well conformed it. It depends upon release eventually false position; never opening offered you, one whose gratitude alone make anxious serve you." "You right, Humphrey, I accept offer; I return things go well." "I thank sincerely decision, Edward," replied Humphrey. "What sweet girl Patience Heatherstone is! I think I never saw enchanting smile!" Edward thought smile she gave parted hour ago, agreed Humphrey, he replied-- "Why, brother, really love intendant's daughter." "Not so, dear brother; I love her goodness sweetness disposition, Alice Edith, I tell you. She promised come see them, bring flowers garden, I hardly know what; I glad it, sisters buried long, gain her company then. No! I leave Mistress Heatherstone you; I love little Clara." "Not bad choice, Humphrey: aspire high, two young foresters, not? However, say 'Every dog his day,' Cromwell his Parliament may theirs. King Charles may his throne now, long catch forest pony, Humphrey." "I hope he will, Edward; recollect laughed idea catching cow--you may surprised second time. 'Where way,' saying is. But I must go help Alice heifer: she quiet yet, I see her going her pail." The brothers parted, Edward walked about, turning his mind events day, often finding his thoughts broken upon sudden visions Patience Heatherstone--and certainly remembrance her satisfactory pleasing portion prospect his offered situation. "I shall live her, continually her company," thought he. "Well, I would take less pleasing office that. She requested accept oblige her, I so. How hasty conclusions! When I first saw her father, aversion I felt him! Now, I know I like him, nay, more--respect him. He said king wished absolute, wrest liberties his subjects, justified opposing him; I never heard Arnwood." "If so, lawful do?" "I think was, murder him; I never admit, intendant; contrary, he holds his murderers great detestation I do. Why, then, think far apart one another. At commencement, two parties supported him, admitting he right, loyal refuse fight king; opposed, hoping force right; king his supposed prerogatives, people liberties. The king obstinate, people resolute, virulent warfare inflamed parties, neither would listen reason; people gained upper hand--they wreaked vengeance, instead looking dictates humanity justice. How easy deposed him, sent beyond seas! instead detained prisoner murdered him. The punishment greater offense, dictated malice revenge; diabolical act, soil page nation's history." So thought Edward, he paced cottage, he summoned Pablo evening meal. CHAPTER XVIII. "Edward," said Edith, "scold Pablo; he ill-treating poor cat; he cruel boy." Pablo laughed. "See, Edward, he is laughing; put pitfall again, let stay till he says he is sorry." "I sorry now, Missy Edith--but cat bite me," said Pablo. "Well, pussy did, did not hurt much; I tell morning Bible?--that must forgive behave ill you." "Yes, Missy Edith, tell that, I do; I forgive pussy she bite me, I kick her it." "That is forgiveness, it, Edward? You forgiven once, kicked all." "Miss Edith, pussy bite me, pussy hurt me, make angry, I give her kick; I think tell me, I tell me. I forgive pussy heart." "I think must forgive Pablo, Edith," said Edward, "if set good example." "Well, I time; he kicks pussy he must put pitfall--mind that, Pablo." "Yes, Missy Edith, I go pitfall, cry, ask Master Edward take out. When put pitfall, good Christian, forgive; cry take out, good Christian more." By conversation appear reader trying impress Pablo principles Christian religion--and case; Edith one active endeavor, although young missionary. However, Alice Humphrey successful, Pablo beginning comprehend attempted instill, really progressing dayly. Edward remained cottage, expecting bear message intendant. He right his conjecture, for, third day, Oswald Partridge came say intendant would happy see him, he could make convenient go over; Edward assented following day. Oswald ridden pony; Edward arranged take Billy return him. They started early next morning, Edward asked Oswald he knew intendant sent him. "Not exactly," replied Oswald; "but I think, I heard Miss Patience say, offer situation, could prevailed upon accept it." "Very true," replied Edward; "he offers post secretary. What think?" "Why, sir, I think I would accept it; events, I would take trial--there harm done. If like it, go back cottage again. One thing I sure of, is, Master Heatherstone make pleasant he can, he anxious serve you." "That I really believe," replied Edward; "and I pretty well made mind accept office. It post confidence, I shall know going on, I I secluded forest; and, depend upon it, shall stirring news." "I suppose think king come over," replied Oswald. "I feel certain it, Oswald; reason I want I know going on." "Well, sir, opinion king come over, well yours; yet I think present he stands poor chance; Master Heatherstone knows score one, I think; he close." The conversation changed, and, ride eight hours, arrived intendant's house. Edward gave Billy Oswald's charge, knocked door. Phoebe let in, asked sitting-room, he found intendant alone. "Edward Armitage, I glad see you, shall still I find made mind accept proposition. What reply?" "I thankful offer, sir," replied Edward, "and accept think I fitting it, I find I equal it; I give trial, leave I find arduous irksome." "Too arduous shall be--that shall concern; irksome I hope find it. My letters many I could answer myself, eyes getting weak, I wish save much possible. You therefore write chiefly I shall dictate; I require person I confide in. I often shall send London instead going myself, I presume objection!" "Certainly none, sir." "Well, then, use saying now; chamber house, live me, table altogether. Neither shall I say thing remuneration, I convinced satisfied. All I require is, know day come, every thing may ready." "I suppose, sir, I must change attire?" replied Edward, looking his forester's dress; "that hardly accord office secretary." "I agree better keep dress forest excursions, I presume altogether abandon them," replied intendant. "You provide suit Lymington. I furnish means." "I thank you, sir, I means, much sufficient," replied Edward, "although quite wealthy little Clara appeared be." "Wealthy, indeed!" replied intendant. "I idea poor Ratcliffe possessed much ready money jewels. Well, then, Wednesday; come next Monday?" "Yes, sir," replied Edward; "I see reason contrary." "Well, then, settled, I suppose would like see accommodation. Patience Clara next room. You join them, make daughter happy telling her become resident us. You will, course, dine us to-day, sleep to-night." Mr. Heatherstone opened door, saying his daughter Patience, "My dear, I leave entertain Edward Armitage till dinner time," he ushered Edward in, closed door again. Clara ran Edward soon he went in, kissed him, Edward took Patience's offered hand. "Then consented?" said Patience, inquiringly. "Yes, I could refuse kindness," replied Edward. "And come?" "On Monday night, I ready time." "Why, get ready?" said Clara. "I must appear forester's dress, little Clara. I wear gun hand, pen: I must go Lymington see tailor me." "You feel strange secretary's dress I boys' clothes," said Clara. "Perhaps I may," said Edward, although he felt would case, accustomed much better clothes Arnwood usually worn secretaries; remembrance brought back Arnwood train, Edward became silent pensive. Patience observed it, time said-- "You able watch sisters, Mr. Armitage, well here, almost, cottage. You return till to-morrow? How come over?" "I rode pony Billy, Mistress Patience." "Why call her Mistress Patience, Edward?" said Clara. "You call Clara; call her Patience?" "You forget I forester, Clara," replied Edward, grave smile. "No, secretary now," replied Clara. "Mistress Patience older several years. I call Clara, little girl; I must take liberty Mistress Heatherstone." "Do think so, Patience?" said Clara. "I certainly think would liberty person, well acquainted me, call Patience," replied she; "especially person lives house us, eats associates us one family, received equality; I dare say, Clara, Master Armitage guided his feelings, act he considers proper." "But give leave, proper," replied Clara. "Yes, he gave leave, Clara," said Patience. "But show his room, Clara," continued Patience, wishing change subject conversation. "Will follow us, sir?" said Patience, little mock ceremony. Edward without replying, ushered large airy room, neatly furnished. "This future lodging," said Patience; "I hope like it." "Why, he never saw thing like before," said Clara. "Yes I have, Clara," replied Edward. "Where you?" "At Arnwood; apartments much larger scale." "Arnwood! oh yes, I heard father speak it," said Clara, tears starting her eyes his memory. "Yes, burned down, children burned death!" "So say, Clara; I burned." "Where then?" "I cottage I live." Edward turned round Patience, perceived her eyes fixed upon him, she would read his thoughts. Edward smiled, said-- "Do doubt I say?" "No, indeed!" said she, "I doubt cottage time; I thinking apartments Arnwood splendid, cottage less comfortable. You used better worse, therefore will, I trust, content these." "I trust I shown signs discontent. I indeed difficult please apartment like suit me. Besides, allow observe, although I stated apartments Arnwood grander scale, I never said I ever possessor one them." Patience smiled made reply. "Now know way apartment, Master Armitage, will, please, go back sitting-room," said she. As going back sitting-room, she said-- "When come Monday, will, I presume, bring clothes cart? I ask it, I promised flowers things sisters, I send back cart." "You kind think them, Mistress Patience," replied Edward; "they fond flowers, much pleased possessing any." "You sleep to-night, I think father said?" inquired Patience. "He make proposal, I shall gladly avail it, I trust Phoebe's ideas comfort time," said Edward, smiling. "Yes, cross action Phoebe's; I tell you, Master Armitage, she ashamed look face ever since; fortunate she cross, turned she did! You must forgive her, she means performing noble action; I must forgive her, she means life saved." "I feeling except kindness toward Phoebe," replied Edward; "indeed I ought feel grateful her; she given bad bed night, I never comfortably lodged proposed I shall now." "I hope hungry, Edward," said Clara; "dinner almost ready." "I dare say I shall eat do, Clara." "So ought, great big man like you. How old you, Edward?" said Clara; "I thirteen; Patience past sixteen: now, old you?" "I yet eighteen, Clara, I hardly called man." "Why, tall Mr. Heatherstone." "Yes, I believe I am." "And cannot every thing man do?" "I really do not know; I certainly shall always try do." "Well, then, must man." "Well, Clara, pleases you, I man." "Here comes Mr. Heatherstone, I know dinner ready; not, sir?" "Yes, child, is," replied Mr. Heatherstone, kissing Clara, "so let us go in." Mr. Heatherstone, usual time people whose party he ostensibly belonged, said grace meat, considerable length, sat table. As soon repast over, Mr. Heatherstone returned his study, Edward went find Oswald Partridge, he remained larger portion afternoon, going kennel examining dogs, talking matters connected chase. "I two men stalk deer," observed Oswald "the men appointed verderers keepers one brought business. Most men army, I believe appointed situations get rid troublesome; thing good characters: consequence is, kill deer, I much attend here, none know duties, I seldom take gun out. I stated intendant, he said accepted offer he made you, came here, want venison; clear he expect pen always hand." "I glad hear that," replied Edward; "depend upon it, his table, events, shall well supplied. Is fellow Corbould, leaning wall?" "Yes; he discharged he walk well, surgeon says he always limp. He owes grudge, I glad he going away, he dangerous man. But sun setting, Mr. Edward, supper soon table; better go back house." Edward bade Oswald farewell, returned intendant's, found Oswald correct, supper placed table. Soon supper, Phoebe men-servants summoned, prayers offered intendant, Patience Clara retired. Edward remained conversation intendant hour, conducted his room, already shown Patience. Edward sleep much night. The novelty his situation--the novelty his prospects, his speculations thereon, kept awake till near morning: he was, however, good time, assisted morning prayers, afterward eaten substantial breakfast, he took his leave intendant two girls, set his return cottage, renewed his promise coming following Monday take his abode them. Billy fresh, cantered gayly along, Edward back early afternoon, welcomed his household. He stated Humphrey occurred, Humphrey much pleased Edward accepted offer intendant. Alice Edith quite much approve it, tears she would idea Edward leaving cottage. The next day, Edward Humphrey set Lymington, Billy cart. "Do know, Edward," said Humphrey, "what I going try purchase? I tell you: many kids I can, goats kids, I do not care which." "Why, stock enough already? You year four cows milk, two cow calves bringing up." "That true; I intend goats milk, simply eating lieu mutton. Sheep I manage, goats, little hay winter, well, find forest year round. I will not kill females first year two, I expect shall flock sufficient meet demand upon it." "It bad idea, Humphrey; always come home hay winter." "Yes, large she would lie snow ground." "Now I recollect, used go Lymington, I saw great many goats, I doubt purchased. I soon ascertain you, landlord hostelry," replied Edward. "We drive first, I must ask recommend tailor." On arrival Lymington, went straight hostelry, found landlord home. He recommended tailor Edward, sent inn, measured plain suit dark cloth. Edward Humphrey went out, Edward procure boots, many articles dress, correspond one he assume. "I puzzled hat, Humphrey," said Edward: "I hate steeple-crowned hats worn Roundheads; yet hat feather proper secretary." "I would advise submit wear steeple-crowned hats, nevertheless," said Humphrey. "Your dress, I consider, sort disgrace Cavalier born, heir Arnwood; not, therefore, take hat well? As secretary intendant, dress like him; not, may occasion remarks, especially travel his concerns." "You right, Humphrey, I must things halves; unless I wear hat, I might suspected." "I doubt intendant wears reason," said Humphrey. "At events, I go height fashion," replied Edward, laughing. "Some hats quite tall others." "Here shop hat sword-belt." Edward chose hat plain sword-belt, paid them, desired man carry hostelry. While purchases part Edward, many others Humphrey, nails, saws, tools, various articles Alice required household, gathered together, landlord sent inquire goats, found price procured. Humphrey left Edward put away cart, he went second time see goats; he made agreement man sale, male three females two kids sides, ten female kids weaned. The man engaged drive Lymington far road went forest, following day, Humphrey would meet them, pay his money, drive cottage, would three miles place agreed upon. Having settled satisfactorily, he returned Edward, ready, went back home. "We dipped somewhat bag to-day, Edward," said Humphrey, "but money well spent." "I think so, Humphrey; I doubt I shall able replace money soon, intendant pay services. The tailor promised clothes Saturday without fail, I must go them." "I go, Edward; sisters wish stay now, soon leave them; I take Pablo me, he may know his way town; I show buy things, case he goes himself." "It appears fortunate thing, caught Pablo did, Humphrey, I well know I could left you, not." "At events, I much better without I done," replied Humphrey; "although I think I could get myself; still, Edward, know tell day may bring forth, I might fall sick, something happen might prevent attending thing; then, without Pablo, every thing might gone rack ruin. Certainly, think left, death old Jacob, resources, much thank God for, got well." "I agree you, also pleased Heaven grant us good health. However, I shall close hand want me, Oswald always call see get on." "I hope manage he calls a-week." "I I can, Humphrey, I shall anxious know goes well. Indeed, I shall insist upon coming a-fortnight; I hardly think intendant refuse me--indeed, I sure he not." "So I," replied Humphrey. "I certain he wishes us well, has, measure, taken us his protection; but, Edward, recollect, I shall never kill venison this, may tell intendant." "I will, excuse send over, he pleases. Indeed, I know I shall permitted go Oswald, hard stray buck find way cottage." Thus continue talking matters till arrived cottage. Alice came them, saying Humphrey, "Well, Humphrey, brought geese ducks?" Humphrey forgotten them, he replied, "You must wait till I go Lymington Saturday, Alice, I hope bring me. As is, look poor Billy loaded. Where is Pablo?" "In garden. He working day, Edith him." "Well, then, unload cart, get us something eat, Alice, little hungry. I tell you." "I rabbit-stew fire, Humphrey, ready you, find good." "Nothing I like better, dear girl. Pablo will not thank bringing home," continued Humphrey, taking long saw cart; "he go bottom pit again, soon pit made." The cart soon unloaded, Billy taken turned feed, went supper. Humphrey next morning, Pablo, early hour, meet farmer he purchased goats kids. He found punctual time, place agreed upon; satisfied lot, paid farmer his money, drove home forest. "Goat good, kid better; always eat kid Spain," said Pablo. "Were born Spain, Pablo?" "Not sure, I think so. First recollect country." "Do recollect father?" "No; never see him." "Did mother never talk him?" "Call her mother, think mother all. Custom Gitanas." "Why call her mother?" "Because she feed little, beat I get big." "All mothers that. What made come England?" "I do not know, I hear people say, plenty money England--plenty eat--plenty drink; bring plenty money back Spain." "How long England?" "One, two, three year; yes, three year bit." "Which like best--England Spain?" "When people, like Spain best; warm sun--warm night. England, little sun, cold night, much rain, snow, air always cold; I live you, warm bed, plenty victuals, like England best." "But gipsies, stole every thing, not?" "Not steal every thing," replied Pablo, laughing; "sometimes take pay nobody there; farmer look sharp--have big dog." "Did ever go steal?" "Make go out. Not bring back something, beat hard; suppose farmer catch me, beat hard too; nothing beat, beat, beat." "Then obliged steal?" "Suppose bring nothing home, first beat, eat one, two, three days. How like that, Master Humphrey? I think steal, victuals three days!" "I hope not," replied Humphrey, "although I never severely punished: I hope, Pablo, never steal more." "Why steal more?" replied Pablo. "I like steal, hungry I steal. Now, I never hungry, always plenty eat; one beat now; sleep warm night. Why I steal, then? No, Master Humphrey, I never steal more, I reason why, Missy Alice Edith tell good God say must steal." "I glad hear give reason, Pablo," replied Humphrey, "as proves sisters teaching vain." "Like hear Missy Alice talk; she talk grave. Missy Edith talk too, she laugh much; fond Missy Edith, happy little girl; jump like one kids drive home; always merry. Hah! see cottage now; soon get home, Massa Humphrey. Missy Edith like see kids much. Where put them?" CHAPTER XIX. "We put yard present. I mean Holdfast shall take charge by-and-by. I soon teach him." "Yes, he take charge coat, thing I tell him; take charge goats. Clever dog, Holdfast. Massa Humphrey, think Massa Edward take away his dogs, Smoker Watch? I say better take puppy. Take Smoker, leave puppy." "I agree you, Pablo. We ought two dogs here. I speak brother. Now run forward open gate yard, throw hay, Pablo, I go call sisters." The flock goats much admired, next morning driven forest feed, attended Pablo Holdfast. When dinner time, Pablo drove flock near cottage, telling dog mind them. The sensible animal remained goats Pablo's return dinner; may well observe here, days dog took charge altogether, driving home yard every evening; soon goats put yard, dog his supper; dog took care, therefore, late. To return narrative. On Saturday, Humphrey Pablo went Lymington, bring home Edward's clothes, Humphrey made Pablo acquainted he wanted know, case might necessary send Pablo alone. Edward remained his sisters, he leave Monday. Sunday passed usual; read service old Armitage's grave, afterward walked forest; Sunday day Alice could find time leave her duties cottage. They grave usual idea Edward's leaving them; kept spirits, aware advantage all. On Monday morning, Edward, please his sisters, put his new clothes, put his forester's dress bundle his linen. Alice Edith thought he looked well them, said reminded days Arnwood. The fact was, Edward appeared he was--a gentleman born; could well concealed forester's dress, his present attire undeniable. After breakfast, Billy harnessed brought cottage-door. Edward's linen put cart, he agreed Humphrey, he took Smoker him, leaving puppy cottage. Pablo went him, bring back cart. Edward kissed his sisters, wept idea his leaving them, and, shaking hands Humphrey, he set cross forest. "Who would ever believed this?" thought Edward, he drove across forest, "that I put roof protection Roundhead--one outward appearance, opinion world least, he altogether opinions. There surely spell upon me, I almost feel I traitor principles. Why I know not, I feel regard man, confidence him. And I not? He knows principles, feelings his party, he respects them. Surely he wish gain his party; indeed ridiculous--a young forester--a youth unknown. No, he would gain nothing that, I nobody. It must goodwill, feeling. I obliged service I rendered his daughter, he grateful." Perhaps, Edward put question himself, "Should I friendly terms intendant--should I accepted his offer, Patience Heatherstone?" he might discovered "spell upon him" rendered tractable; he idea. He felt his situation would rendered comfortable society amiable handsome girl, he inquired further. His revery broken Pablo, appeared tired holding his tongue, said, "Massa Edward, like leave home--you think much. Why go there?" "I certainly like leave home, Pablo, I fond brother sisters; always wish world, sakes, inclinations, I done so." "Cannot see good Missy Alice Missy Edith go away. How possible good, them? Suppose bad accident, away, good? Suppose bad accident, cottage, good. I think, Massa Edward, foolish." Edward laughed blunt observation Pablo's, replied, "It true, Pablo, I watch sisters, protect person, I away; reasons I go, nevertheless, I may useful going remaining them. If I think so, I would leave them. They know nobody, friends world. Suppose anything happen me--suppose Humphrey I die--for know never know soon event may take place--who would protect poor sisters, would become them? Is not, therefore, wise I procure friends them, case accident, would look protect them? hope, leaving now, I shall make powerful kind friends them. Do understand me?" "Yes, I see now; think me, Massa Edward. I say now, foolish; I say now, Pablo great fool." "Besides, Pablo, recollect I never would left long Humphrey I look them, accident might happened one us; came live us, I found good, clever boy were, fond us all, I said, 'Now I leave sisters, Pablo shall take place, assist Humphrey required, take care them.' Am I right, Pablo?" "Yes, Massa Edward," replied Pablo, taking hold Edward's wrist, "you quite right. Pablo love Missy Alice, Missy Edith, Massa Humphrey, you, Massa Edward; he love much indeed; he love much he die you! Can more." "That I really thought you, Pablo, yet I glad hear mouth. If come live us, proved faithful, I could left benefit sisters; induced leave, thank I able service them." "Well, Massa Edward, go; never mind us, make plenty work; every thing you." "I think will, Pablo, reason I agreed go away. But, Pablo, Billy growing old, want ponies." "Yes, Massa Edward; Massa Humphrey talk ponies last night, say plenty forest. Ask I think us able catch them. I say yes, catch one, two, twenty, suppose want them." "Ah! that, Pablo?" "Massa Edward, tell Massa Humphrey possible, I tell how," replied Pablo, laughing. "Some day come see us, see five ponies stable. Massa Humphrey I, talk about, find how; see." "Well, then, I shall ask questions, Pablo; I see ponies stable, I will believe it, before." "Suppose want big horse ride, catch big horse, Massa Edward, see. Massa Humphrey clever, he catch cow." "Catch gipsy," said Edward. "Yes," said Pablo, laughing, "catch cow, catch gipsy, by-and-by catch horse." When Edward arrived intendant's house, he kindly received intendant two girls. Having deposited his wardrobe his bedroom, he went Oswald put Smoker kennel, his return found Pablo sitting carpet sitting-room, talking Patience Clara, three appeared much amused. When Pablo Billy something eat, cart filled pots flowers, several, little things presents Patience Heatherstone, Pablo set his return. "Well, Edward, look like a--" said Clara, stopping. "Like secretary, I hope," added Edward. "Well, do not look like forester; he, Patience?" continued Clara. "You must judge people clothes, Clara." "Nor I," replied Clara. "Those clothes would look well upon Oswald, men, would suit them; suit you: do not they, Patience?" Patience Heatherstone, however, make answer second appeal made Clara. "Why do not answer me, Patience?", said Clara. "My dear Clara, it is custom young maidens make remarks upon people's attire. Little girls like may so." "Why, tell Pablo he looked well his new clothes?" "Yes, Pablo Mr. Armitage, Clara. That different." "Well, may be, still might answer question, put you, Patience: I ask again, Edward look much better dress he one he generally worn?" "I think becoming dress, Clara, since answer." "Fine feathers make fine birds, Clara," said Edward, laughing; "and say it." Edward changed conversation. Soon afterward dinner announced, Clara observed Edward, "Why always call Patience Mistress Heatherstone? Ought he call her Patience, sir?" said Clara, appealing intendant. "That must depend upon his feelings, dear Clara," replied Mr. Heatherstone. "It intention wave ceremony much possible. Edward Armitage come live us one family, he find treated one us. I shall, therefore, future address Edward; he full permission, I may say wish, he familiar terms us all. When Edward feels inclined address daughter he you, her name baptism, he will, I dare say, he heard opinion, so; reserve 'Mistress Heatherstone,' time quarrel." "Then I hope he never address way," observed Patience, "for I great obligations bear even idea bad terms him." "Do hear that, Edward?" said Clara. "Yes, I do, Clara, remark may sure I shall never address her way again." In days, Edward became quite home. In forenoon, Mr. Heatherstone dictated one two letters him, he wrote; his time his disposal, chiefly passed company Patience Clara. With first he become intimate brotherly footing; addressed other, Patience Edward appellations made use of. Once Mr. Heatherstone asked Edward whether he would like go Oswald kill deer, he did; venison hardly yet season. There fine horse stable Edward's order, he often rode Patience Clara; indeed his time passed agreeably he could hardly think possible fortnight passed away, he asked permission go cottage see his sisters. With intendant's permission, Patience Clara accompanied him; joy Alice Edith great made appearance. Oswald had, Edward's request, gone day two before, tell coming, might prepared; consequence was, holyday cottage. Alice cooked her best dinner, Humphrey Pablo home receive them. "How pleasant be, see Clara whenever see Edward!" said Alice Patience. "So far sorry Edward you, I shall quite glad it." "I water flowers every day," said Edith, "and make garden look gay." "I bring plenty autumn, Edith; right time transplanting flowers yet," replied Patience. "And now, Alice, must take see farm, I last I time; let us come now, show every thing." "But dinner, Patience; I leave it, spoiled, never do. You must either go Edith now, wait till dinner, I get away." "Well, then, stay till dinner, Alice, help serve up." "Thank you; Pablo generally that, Edith reach things. I do not know he is." "He went away Edward Humphrey I think," said Edith. "I will scold he comes back, way." "Never mind, Edith, I reach dishes," said Patience, "and Clara take them, platters, put table Alice." And Patience she proposed, dinner soon afterward table. There ham, two boiled fowls, piece salted beef, roasted kid, besides potatoes green peas; considered dinner bet table young people left entirely exertions industry, must admitted farm great credit. In mean time, Edward Humphrey, first greetings over, walked converse, Pablo taken horses stable. "Well, Humphrey get on?" "Very well," replied Humphrey. "I finished tough job. I dug saw-pit, sawed slabs sides pit, made quite secure. The large fir-tree blown pit, ready sawing planks, Pablo I commence to-morrow. At first made bad hand sawing slabs, cut all, got pretty well Pablo do not much like it, indeed I much, mechanical work, tiring; he complain--I intend he shall saw two days week; sufficient: shall get fast enough. "You right, Humphrey; old saying, must work willing horse death. Pablo willing, hard work he accustomed to. "Well, must come look flock goats, Edward, far off. I taught Holdfast take care them, he never leaves now, brings home night. Watch always remains me, excellent dog, intelligent." "You indeed fine flock, Humphrey!" said Edward. "Yes, improved appearance already since here. Alice got her geese ducks, I made place large enough wash in, I time dig pond." "I thought gathered hay required; addition, I think find none spare spring." "So far it, I mowing great deal more, Edward, almost ready carry away. Poor Billy hard work it, I assure you, since he came back, one thing another." "Poor fellow! will not last long, Humphrey," said Edward, smiling; "the horses soon take his place." "I trust will," said Humphrey, "at events next spring; I expect will." "By-the-by, Humphrey, recollect I said robber I shot told he died." "Yes, I recollect now," replied Humphrey; "but I quite forgotten till mentioned now, although I wrote might forget it." "Well, I thinking it, Humphrey. The robber told money mine, taking another person; therefore I consider given me, I consider his give. I hardly know it, money said belong." "Well, I think I answer question. The property malefactors belongs king; therefore money belongs king; may retain king, use his service." "Yes, would belonged king, man condemned, hung gallows he deserved; he not, therefore I think belong king." "Then belongs whoever finds it, keeps till claimed--which never be." "I think I must speak intendant it," replied Edward; "I feel comfortable." "Then so," replied Humphrey; "I think right concealments him." "But, Humphrey," replied Edward, laughing, "what silly fellows are! yet know whether shall find thing; must first see thing buried there; done so, decide act. I shall, please God, fortnight, mean time, find place, ascertain fellow said true." "I will," replied Humphrey. "I go to-morrow, Billy cart, take spade pickax me. It may fool's errand, still say, one would credit, honor human nature, words dying man truth. We better go back now, I think dinner must ready." Now become intimate Patience Heatherstone--and, I may add, fond her--there longer restraint, merry dinner party; dinner, Patience went Alice Edith, looked garden farm. She wished much ascertain thing required, she could discover things, trifles; she recollected all, sent cottage days afterward. But hour parting arrived, long ride back, could stay longer wished get home dark, Mr. Heatherstone requested Edward do; horses brought out, wishing good-by, set again--little Edith crying them, "Come soon! Patience, must come soon!" CHAPTER XX. The summer advanced, Oswald one day said Edward, "Have heard news, sir?" "Nothing particular," replied Edward; "I know General Cromwell Ireland, say successful; I cared little particulars." "They say great deal more, sir," replied Oswald; "they say king Scotland, Scotch raised army him." "Indeed!" replied Edward, "that news indeed! The intendant never mentioned me." "I dare say not, sir; he knows feelings, would sorry part you." "I certainly speak subject," said Edward, "risk his displeasure; join army I will, I find say true. I hold craven remain king fighting his own, his side." "Well, sir, I think true, I heard Parliament sent General Cromwell leave Ireland, lead troops Scotch army." "You drive mad, Oswald! I go intendant immediately!" Edward, much excited intelligence, went room he usually sat intendant. The latter, his desk, looked up, saw flushed Edward was, said quietly, "Edward, excited, I presume, hearing news arrived?" "Yes, sir, I much so; I regret much I last important news made known." "It is, say, important news," replied intendant; "but sit down, talk little upon subject." Edward took chair, intendant said, "I doubt present feeling go Scotland, join army without delay." "Such intention, I candidly confess, sir. It duty." "Perhaps may persuaded contrary part," replied intendant. "The first duty owe family present position; depend upon you; false step part would ruin. How leave them, leave employ, without known purpose gone? It impossible! I must make known, even would injurious me, circumstance one party service. I suspected many already, consequence part I taken murder late king, also lords since suffered. But, Edward, I communicate intelligence many reasons. I knew would soon come ears, I thought better I prepared show may harm, good king. I show I put confidence you; read letters, prove I correct I assert." The intendant handed three letters Edward, evident king's friends England opinion time ripe attempt, would sacrifice stir matter; Scotch army raised composed greatest enemies king, best thing could happen king's interest would destroyed Cromwell; impossible English adherents Charles join them, Scotch wish do. "You politician, Edward," said intendant, smiling, Edward laid letters table. "You must admit that, showing letters, I put utmost confidence you." "You have, indeed, sir; and, thanking done, I need hardly add confidence never betrayed." "That I sure of; I trust agree friends best thing remain quiet." "Certainly, sir, future I guided you." "That I require you; and, promise, shall hear news soon arrives. There thousands anxious see king throne are, Edward--and know I one them; hour yet come, must bide time. Depend upon it, General Cromwell scatter army like chaff. He his march now. After passed us day, Edward, I shall talk unreserved going on." "I thank you, sir, I promise faithfully, I said before, guided advice, secret may trust with." "I confidence you, Edward Armitage; drop subject present; Patience Clara want walk them, good-by present." Edward left intendant, much pleased interview. The intendant kept his word, concealed nothing Edward. All turned intendant foretold. The Scotch army cut pieces Cromwell, king retreated Highlands; Edward felt satisfied he could better guided intendant his future undertakings. We must pass time words. Edward continued intendant's, gave great satisfaction Mr. Heatherstone. He passed his time agreeably, sometimes going shoot deer Oswald, often supplying venison his brother sisters cottage. During autumn, Patience often went cottage, occasionally Mr. Heatherstone paid visit; winter set in, Edward came himself, shooting he went; he Smoker came cottage, Billy always journey go venison left forest. Patience sent Alice many little things use her Edith, good books read; Humphrey, evenings, read his sisters, might learn he could teach them. Pablo also learned read write. Humphrey Pablo worked saw-pit, sawed large quantity boards timber building, building put till spring. The reader may recollect Edward proposed Humphrey he ascertain whether robber stated his death relative his concealed his ill-gotten wealth tree struck lightning true. About ten days afterward Humphrey set expedition. He take Pablo him, as, although he good opinion him, he agreed Oswald temptation put his way. Humphrey considered would best plan go Clara's cottage, proceed find oak-tree mentioned robber. When he arrived thicket surrounded cottage, occurred he would go see state left in; intendant there, he given directions his men remain bury bodies, lock doors cottage, bring keys him, done. Humphrey tied Billy cart tree, walked thicket. As he approached cottage he heard voices; induced advance carefully, he brought his gun him. He crouched he came opening cottage. The doors windows open, two men sitting outside, cleaning guns; one Humphrey recognized man Corbould, discharged intendant soon his wound cured, supposed gone London. Humphrey far hear said; he remained time, three men came cottage. Satisfied he seen, Humphrey cautiously retreated, and, gaining outside thicket, led away Billy cart turf, noise wheels might heard. "This bodes good," thought Humphrey he went along, every looking back ascertain men come seen him. "That Corbould know vowed vengeance Edward, us; has, doubt, joined robbers--for robbers must be--that he may fulfill his vow. It fortunate I made discovery I send immediately intendant." As soon clump trees shut thicket, he longer fear seen people, Humphrey went direction robber mentioned, soon afterward he perceived oak scathed lightning, stood green spot twenty acres. It noble tree destroyed; spread long naked arms, covering large space ground, without least sign vegetation life remaining. The trunk many feet diameter, apparently quite sound, although tree dead. Humphrey left Billy feed herbage close by, then, position sun heavens, ascertained point he dig. First looking around see he overlooked, he took his spade pick-ax cart begun his task. There spot quite green rest, Humphrey thought likely place he dig at, probably green soil removed. He commenced spot, and, moments' labor, his pick-ax struck upon something hard, which, clearing away earth, he discovered wooden lid box. Satisfied he right, Humphrey worked hard, minutes he cleared away sufficiently able lift box place turf. He examine it, he perceived, five hundred yards' distance, three men coming toward him. "They discovered me," thought Humphrey; "and I must soon I can." He ran Billy, close him, bringing cart box lay, he lifted in. As he getting himself, reins his hands, he perceived three men running toward fast could, guns hands. They hundred fifty yards Humphrey set off, putting Billy full trot. The three men, observing this, called Humphrey stop, would fire; Humphrey's reply giving lash Billy, set gallop. The men immediately fired, bullets whistled past Humphrey without harm. Humphrey looked round, finding he increased his distance, pulled pony, went moderate pace. "You will catch me," thought Humphrey; "and guns loaded, I will tantalize little." He made Billy walk, turned round see men about; arrived he dug box, standing round hole, evidently aware use following him. "Now," thought Humphrey he went along faster pace, "those fellows wonder I digging up. The villains little think I know find them, proved firing me. Now, must I do? They may follow cottage, I doubt know live, Edward intendant's. They may come attack us, I dare leave cottage tonight, send Pablo away, case should; I tomorrow morning." Humphrey considered, he went along, circumstances probabilities, decided he would act he first proposed himself. In hour he cottage; soon Alice given his dinner--for he later usual dinner hour--he told her taken place. "Where Pablo?" "He working garden Edith day," replied Alice. "Well, dear, I hope come tonight: tomorrow I custody; come, must best beat off. It fortunate Edward left guns pistols he found Clara's cottage, shall want firearms; barricade doors windows, get hurry; I must Pablo help me, time lost." "But I help you, Humphrey?" said Alice. "Surely I something?" "We see, Alice; I think I without you. We still plenty daylight. I take box room." Humphrey, taken box cart carried within threshold door, took his sisters' bedroom, went called Pablo, came running him. "Pablo," said Humphrey, "we must bring cottage large pieces sawed rafters; I surprised cottage attacked night." He told Pablo taken place. "You see, Pablo, I dare send intendant to-night, case robbers come here." "No, send to-night," said Pablo; "stay fight them; first make door fast, cut hole fire through." "Yes, idea. You do not mind fighting them, Pablo?" "No; fight hard Missy Alice Missy Edith," said Pablo; "fight too, Massa Humphrey, fight myself," added Pablo, laughing. They went pieces squared timber, brought saw-pit cottage, soon fitted doors windows, prevent several men, using strength, forcing open. "That do," said Humphrey; "and get small saw, Pablo, I cut hole two fire through." It dark finished, made fast, went Pablo's room arms, got ready service, loaded. "Now ready, Alice, let us supper," said Humphrey. "We make fight it, shall get easily think." After supper, Humphrey said prayers, told his sisters go bed. "Yes, Humphrey, go bed, undress, come, I must help you. I load gun, know, Edith take fast I load them. Will not you, Edith?" "Yes, I bring guns, Humphrey, shall shoot them," replied Edith. Humphrey kissed his sisters, went room. He put light chimney, he might get one case robbers came, desired Pablo go lie his bed, he intended same. Humphrey remained awake till past three of the clock morning, robbers came. Pablo snoring loud, last Humphrey fell asleep himself, wake till broad daylight. He got up, found Alice Edith already sitting-room, lighting fire. "I would wake you, Humphrey, sitting long. The robbers made appearance, clear; shall unbar door window-shutters now?" "Yes, I think may. Here, Pablo!" "Yes," replied Pablo, coming half asleep; "what matter? thief come?" "No," replied Edith, "thief come, sun shine, lazy Pablo get up." "Up now, Missy Edith." "Yes, awake yet." "Yes, Missy Edith, quite awake." "Well, then, help undo door, Pablo." They took barricades, Humphrey opened door cautiously, looked out. "They will not come now, events, I think," observed Humphrey; "but saying--they may prowling about, may think easier get daytime night. Go out, Pablo, look every where; take pistol you, fire danger, come back fast can." Pablo took pistol, Humphrey went door looked well round front cottage, he would leave door till he assured one there. Pablo returned soon after, saying he looked round every where, cow-house yard, nobody seen. This satisfied Humphrey, returned cottage. "Now, Pablo, get breakfast, I write letter intendant," said Humphrey; "and must saddle Billy, go fast letter. You tell I said it. I shall expect back night, people you." "I see," said Pablo, immediately busied cold meat Alice put him. Pablo finished his breakfast brought Billy door, Humphrey finished his letter. As soon written folded, Pablo set off, fast Billy could go, side forest. Humphrey continued look-out whole day, his gun his arm, his two dogs his side; he knew dogs would give notice approach one, long he might see them; nothing occurred whole day; evening closed he barricaded doors windows, remained watch dogs, waiting coming robbers, arrival party he expected would sent intendant take robbers. Just dark, Pablo returned note Edward, saying he would over, cottage ten of the clock, large party. Humphrey said his letter, would better force sent intendant arrive till dark, robbers might near perceive them, might escape; he therefore expect come till time dark. Humphrey reading book--Pablo dozing chimney corner--the two girls retired room lain bed clothes, dogs gave low growl. "Somebody come," said Pablo, starting up. Again dogs growled, Humphrey made sign Pablo hold his tongue. A short time anxious silence succeeded, impossible ascertain whether parties friends enemies. The dogs sprung barked furiously door, soon Humphrey silenced them, voice heard outside, begging admission poor benighted traveler. This sufficient; could party intendant's, robbers wished induce open door. Pablo put gun Humphrey's hand, took another himself; he removed light chimney, application outside repeated, Humphrey answered, "That he never opened door hour night, useless remaining." No answer repetition request made, but, Humphrey retreated Pablo fireplace, gun fired lock door, blown room, and, barricades, doors must flown open. The robbers appeared surprised case, one inserted his arm hole made door, ascertain might obstacle open it, Pablo slipped past Humphrey, gaining door, discharged his gun arm thrust hole door. The party, whoever might been, gave loud cry, fell threshold outside. "I think do," said Humphrey: "we must take life necessary. I rather fired his arm--it would disabled him, would sufficed." "Kill much better," said Pablo. "Corbould shot leg, come rob; suppose shot dead, never rob more." The dogs flew back cottage, evidently pointing robbers attempting side. Humphrey put his gun hole door, discharged it. "Why that, Massa Humphrey? nobody there!" "I know that, Pablo; people coming intendant's, see flash perhaps hear report, let know going on." "There another gun loaded, Humphrey," said Alice, Edith joined without Humphrey observing it. "Thanks, love; Edith must remain here; sit hearth, sheltered bullet may fire house. I fear getting in, shall help directly, I doubt. Pablo, I shall fire back door; must there, dogs noses it, violent. Do fire another gun, signal, hole front door." Humphrey stood within four feet back door, fired dogs held noses barked. Pablo discharged his gun directed, returned reload guns. The dogs quiet, appeared robbers retreated back door. Pablo blew light, put center room Alice Edith took possession fireplace. "No fear, Missy Edith, I know find every thing," said Pablo, went peered hole front door, see robbers coming again; he could see hear nothing time. At last attack renewed; dogs flew backward forward, sometimes one door another, assailed; time crash Alice's bedchamber told robbers burst small window room, Humphrey paid attention to, small man could hardly introduce his body it. Humphrey immediately called Holdfast opened door room, he thought man forcing his way would driven back held dog, he Pablo dared leave two doors. Watch, dog, followed Holdfast bedroom; oaths curses, mingled savage yells dogs, told conflict going on. Both doors battered heavy pieces timber time, Pablo said, "Great many robbers here." A moment passed, Pablo Humphrey fired guns door, when, sudden, sounds heard--shots fired outside, loud cries, angry oaths exclamations. "The intendant's people come," said Humphrey, "I sure it." Shortly afterward Humphrey heard his name called Edward, he replied, went door undid barricades. "Get light, Alice, dear," said Humphrey, "we safe now. I open door directly, Edward, dark I see fastenings." "Are safe, Humphrey?" "Yes, safe, Edward. Wait till Alice brings light," Alice soon brought one, door unfastened. Edward stepped body man lay threshold, saying-- "You settled somebody there, events," caught Edith Alice his arms. He followed Oswald men, leading prisoners. "Bind fellow fast, Oswald," said Edward. "Get another light, Pablo; let us see lies outside door." "First see bedroom, Edward," said Alice, "for dogs still there." "In bedroom, dearest? Well, then, let us go first." Edward went Humphrey, found man half window half out, held throat apparently suffocated two dogs. He took dogs off; desiring men secure robber, ascertain whether he alive not, he returned sitting-room, went examine body outside door. "Corbould, I live!" cried Oswald. "Yes," replied Edward, "he gone his account. God forgive him!" On inquiry found, robbers, number ten, one escaped--eight made prisoners, Corbould, man dogs seized, found quite dead, made number. The robbers bound guarded; then, leaving charge Oswald five his men, Edward Humphrey set seven Clara's cottage, ascertain found there. They arrived two of the clock morning, and, knocking several times, door opened seized another man, one found it. They went back cottage prisoner, time arrived daylight. As soon party sent intendant supplied breakfast, Edward bade farewell Humphrey his sisters, he might return deliver his prisoners. Pablo went bring back cart carried two dead bodies. This capture cleared forest robbers long infested it, never attempts made time. Before Edward left, Humphrey he examined box Humphrey dug oak, occasioned danger inmates cottage; one men stated Edward suspected box seen Humphrey dig contained treasure, without seen possession it, never attacked cottage, although Corbould often persuaded do; knew he seeking revenge--and required money stimulate them--they refused, considered nothing obtained cottage worth risk, knew inmates firearms, would defend themselves. On examination contents, found box sum 40 pounds gold, bag silver, valuables silver spoons, candlesticks, ornaments women. Edward took list contents, he returned he stated intendant occurred, requested know done money articles Humphrey found. "I wish said nothing it," said intendant, "although I pleased open fair dealing. I say thing, except better let Humphrey keep till claimed--which, course, never be. But, Edward, Humphrey must come make his deposition, I must report capture robbers, send trial. You better go clerk take depositions Pablo sisters, Humphrey comes here. You stay till his return. Their depositions much consequence Humphrey's, speak attack, Humphrey's I must take myself." When Patience Clara heard Edward going over, obtained leave go see Alice Edith, escorted back Humphrey. This intendant consented to, merry party. Humphrey remained two days intendant's house, returned cottage, Edward taken his place his absence. CHAPTER XXI. The winter set severe, falls snow heavy frequent. It fortunate Humphrey provident making large quantity hay, stock would starved. The flock goats, great part, subsisted bark trees moss; night hay given them, well. It hardly possible Edward come see his brother sisters, snow deep render long journey fatiguing horse. Twice thrice snow fell, he contrived get over; knew impossible, expect him. Humphrey Pablo little except attending stock, cutting firewood keep supply, burned fast. The snow lay several feet high round cottage, driven wind. They kept passage clear yard, kept yard clear snow possible: could more. A sharp frost clear weather succeeded snow-storms, appeared chance snow melting away. The nights dark long, oil lamp getting low. Humphrey anxious go Lymington, required many things impossible go except foot, walking was, depth snow, fatiguing exercise. There one thing, however, Humphrey forgotten, was, he told Edward he would try capture forest ponies; whole time since heavy fall snow taken place he making his arrangements. The depth snow prevented animals obtaining grass, almost starved, could find nothing subsist upon except twigs branches trees could reach. Humphrey went Pablo, found herd, five miles cottage, near Clara's cottage. He Pablo brought much hay could carry, strewed about, draw ponies nearer them, Humphrey looked place would answer his purpose. About three miles cottage, he found he thought would suit him; sort avenue two thickets, hundred yards wide; wind blowing avenue, snow-storm, drifted snow one end it, right across raised large mound several feet high. By strewing small bundles hay, he drew herd ponies avenue; avenue he left good quantity feed upon every night several nights, till last herd ponies went every morning. "Now, Pablo, must make trial," said Humphrey. "You must get lassoes ready, case required. We must go avenue daylight, two dogs, tie one upon one side avenue other, may bark prevent ponies attempting escape thicket. Then must get ponies us drift snow lies across avenue, try draw drift. If so, plunge deep able get thrown ropes round necks." "I see," said Pablo; "very good--soon catch them." Before daylight went dogs large bundle hay, strewed nearer mound drift-snow. They tied dogs side, ordering lie quiet. They walked thicket perceived, considered far enough drift-snow. About daylight, herd came pick hay usual, passed Humphrey Pablo followed thicket, wishing show till last moment. While ponies busy hay, suddenly ran avenue separated, prevent ponies attempting gallop past them. Shouting loud could, ran ponies, calling dogs, immediately set barking side, ponies, alarmed noise appearance Humphrey Pablo, naturally set direction appeared clear, galloped away mound drift-snow, tails streaming, snorting plunging snow hurried along; soon arrived mound drift-snow, plunged first bellies, afterward, attempted force way snow deeper, many stuck fast altogether, attempted clear vain. Humphrey Pablo, followed fast could run, came threw lasso neck one, ropes slip-nooses two more, floundering snow together. The remainder herd, great exertions, got clear snow turning round galloping back avenue. The three ponies captured made furious struggle, drawing ropes tight round necks choked, soon unable move. They tied fore-legs, loosed ropes round necks, might recover breath. "Got now, Massa Humphrey," said Pablo. "Yes; work yet over, Pablo; must get home; shall manage that?" "Suppose eat to-day to-morrow, get tame." "I believe best way; get loose again, can." "No, sir; get one home to-day. This fine pony; suppose try him." Pablo put halter on, tied end short fore-leg pony, could walk without keeping head close ground--if raised head, obliged lift leg. Then he put lasso round neck, choke unruly, done that, he cast loose ropes tied fore-legs together. "Now, Massa Humphrey, get home somehow. First I go loose dogs; he 'fraid dogs, run t'other way." The pony, iron-gray handsome, plunged furiously kicked behind, could without falling down, several times Pablo returned dogs. Humphrey held one part lasso one side, Pablo other, keeping pony them; dogs barking behind, contrived, great deal exertion trouble, get pony cottage. The poor animal, driven way three legs, every choked lasso, covered foam arrived. Billy turned his stable make room new-comer, fastened securely manger left without food, he might become tame. It late then, tired go two ponies; left lying snow night, next morning found much tamer first; day, following plan, brought stable secured alongside other. One bay pony black legs, brown one. The bay pony mare, two horses. Alice Edith delighted new ponies, Humphrey little pleased he succeeded capturing them, passed Edward him. After two days' fasting, poor animals tame ate Pablo's hand, submitted stroked caressed; fortnight stable, Alice Edith could go without danger. They soon broken in; yard full muck, Pablo took mounted them. They plunged kicked first, tried could get rid him, sunk deep muck soon tired out; month, three tolerably quiet ride. The snow deep country little communication metropolis. The intendant's letters spoke King Charles raising another army Holland, his adherents England preparing join soon he marched southward. "I think, Edward," said intendant, "that king's affairs wear promising aspect; plenty time yet. I know anxiety serve king, I blame it. I shall prevent going, although, course, I must appear cognizant done. When winter breaks I shall send London. You better able judge going on, absence create suspicion; must guided me." "I certainly will, sir," replied Edward. "I should, indeed, like strike one blow king, come will." "All depends upon whether manage affairs well Scotland; much jealousy pride, and, I fear, treachery also, hard say matters may end." It soon conversation messenger arrived London letters, announcing King Charles crowned Scotland, great solemnity magnificence. "The plot thickens," said intendant; "and letter correspondent, Ashley Cooper, I find king's army well appointed, David Lesley lieutenant-general; Middleton commands horse, Wemyss artillery. That Wemyss certainly good officer, true late king: may he behave better present! Now, Edward, I shall send London, I give letters advise proceed. You may take black horse; he bear well. You course write me, Sampson go you, send back consider require wish his presence: time lost, for, depend upon it, Cromwell, still Edinburgh, take field soon he can. Are ready start to-morrow morning?" "Yes, sir, quite ready." "I fear go cottage bid farewell sisters; but, perhaps, better not." "I think too, sir," replied Edward; "now snow nearly disappeared, I think going over, long absent, I must send Oswald instead." "Well, then, leave write letters, prepare saddle-bags. Patience Clara assist you. Tell Sampson come me." Edward went Patience Clara, told he set London following morning, make his preparations. "How long remain, Edward?" inquired Patience. "I tell; Sampson goes me, I must, course, guided father. Do know saddle-bags are, Patience?" "Yes; Phoebe shall bring room." "And Clara must come give assistance." "Certainly will, require it; I know wardrobe extensive." "You know thing extensive, Patience; reason assistance required. A small wardrobe ought least good order; I would require is, would look linen, requires little repair, bestow upon charity." "That do, Clara;" replied Patience; "so get needles thread, let us send London whole linen. We come ready, sir." "I do not like his going London all," said Clara, "we shall lonely he gone." Edward left room, obtained saddlebags Phoebe gone his chamber. The first thing he laid hold his father's sword; he took down, wiped carefully, he kissed it, saying, "God grant I may credit it, prove worthy wield brave father!" He uttered words aloud; taking sword, laying bed, turned round, perceived Patience had, unknown him, entered room, standing close him. Edward conscious he spoken aloud, therefore merely said, "I aware presence, Patience. Your foot light." "Whose sword that, Edward?" "It mine; I bought Lymington." "But makes affection sword?" "Affection it?" "Yes; I came room kissed fervently as--" "As lover would his mistress, I presume would say," replied Edward. "Nay, I meant use vain words. I say, devout Catholic would relic. I ask again, Why so? A sword sword. You leave mission father's. You soldier, engage strife war; were, kiss sword?" "I tell you. I love sword. I purchased it, I told you, Lymington, told belonged Colonel Beverley. It his sake I love it. You know obligations family him." "This sword wielded Colonel Beverley, celebrated Cavalier, it?" said Patience, taking bed, examining it. "Yes, was; here, see, his initials upon hilt." "And take London you? Surely weapon worn secretary, Edward; large cumbrous, character." "Recollect, till last months I forester, Patience, secretary. Indeed, I feel I fit active life situation father's kindness bestowed upon me. I brought up, heard, follow wars, patron lived." Patience made reply. Clara joined them, commenced task examining linen; Edward left room, he wished speak Oswald. They meet till dinner time. Edward's sudden departure spread gloom all--even intendant silent thoughtful. In evening he gave Edward letters he written, considerable sum money, telling he apply he required his expenses. The intendant cautioned his behavior many points, also relative his dress carriage his stay metropolis. "If leave London, occasion--nay, would dangerous write me. I shall take granted retain Sampson till departure, he returns I shall presume gone north. I detain longer, Edward: may Heaven bless protect you!" So saying, intendant went away his room. "Kind generous man!" thought Edward; "how much I mistake first met!" Taking letters bag money, still remained table, Edward went his room, placed letters money saddle-bag, he commended Divine Protector, retired rest. Before daylight, sound Sampson's heavy traveling-boots roused Edward, he soon dressed. Taking his saddle-bags his arm, he walked softly stairs, he might disturb family; he passing sitting-room, he perceived light it, and, looking in, Patience dressed. Edward looked surprised, speak, Patience said-- "I rose early, Edward, because, I took leave last night, I forgot little parcel I wanted give went. It take much room, may beguile weary hour. It little book meditations. Will accept it, promise read time?" "I certainly will, dear Patience--if I may venture expression--read it, think you." "Nay, must read it, think contains," replied Patience. "I will, then. I shall need book remind Patience Heatherstone, I assure you." "And now, Edward, I pretend surmise reason departure, would becoming attempt discover father thinks proper silent upon; I must beg promise one thing." "Name it, dear Patience," replied Edward; "my heart full thought leaving you, I feel I refuse nothing." "It this: I presentiment, I know why, encounter danger. If so, prudent--be prudent sake dear sisters--be prudent sake friends, would regret you--promise that." "I promise you, faithfully, Patience, I ever sisters thoughts, rash circumstances." "Thank you, Edward; may God bless preserve you!" Edward first kissed Patience's hand, held his own; but, perceiving tears starting her eyes, he kissed off, without remonstrance her part, left room. In moments he mounted fine, powerful black horse, and, followed Sampson, his road London. We pass journey, accomplished without event worthy remark. Edward had, commencement, called Sampson his side, he might answer questions he make upon he saw, which, reader must aware, quite new one whose peregrinations confined New Forest town adjacent. Sampson powerful man, cool silent character, means deficient intelligence, trustworthy withal. He long follower intendant, served army. He devout, generally, addressed, singing hymns low voice. On evening second day, close metropolis, Sampson pointed Edward St. Paul's Cathedral Westminster Abbey, objects worthy note. "And lodge, Sampson?" inquired Edward. "The best hotel I know man beast 'Swan Three Necks,' Holborn. It over-frequented roisterers, quiet, and, affairs demand it, unobserved." "That suit me, Sampson: I wish observe observed, stay London." Before dark arrived hotel, horses stable. Edward procured apartment his satisfaction, and, feeling fatigued his two days' traveling, gone bed. The following morning he examined letters given intendant, inquired Sampson he could direct his way. Sampson knew London well; Edward set Spring Gardens, deliver letter, intendant informed confidential, person name Langton. Edward knocked ushered in, Sampson taking seat hall, Edward shown handsomely-furnished library, he found presence tall, spare man, dressed fashion Roundheads time. He presented letter. Mr. Langton bowed, requested Edward sit down; and, Edward taken chair, he seated opened letter.

He hints probably obliged take journey north, glad take charge letters I may send direction. I ready you; and, case need, give coloring proceeding, provided may choose reveal true object. How wears good friend Heatherstone his daughter?" "Quite well, sir." "And he told one his former letters he daughter poor friend Ratcliffe him. Is so?" "It is, Master Langton; gentle, pretty child would wish see." "When arrive London?" "Yesterday evening, sir." "And purpose stay?" "That I answer, sir; I must guided advice. I naught here, unless deliver three four letters, given Mr. Heatherstone." "It opinion, Master Armitage, less seen city better; hundreds employed find new-comers, discover, people, means, purpose may come; must aware, Master Armitage, times dangerous, people's minds various. In attempting free considered despotism, created worse despotism, one less endurable. It hoped passed make kings subjects wiser been. Now, propose--to leave instantly?" "Certainly, think advisable." "My advice, then, leave London immediately. I give letters friends mine Lancashire Yorkshire; either county remain unnoticed, make preparations think necessary. But nothing haste--consult well, guided them, will, considered advisable prudent, join project. I need say more. Call upon to-morrow morning, hour noon, I letters ready you." Edward rose depart, thanked Mr. Langton his kindness. "Farewell, Master Armitage," said Langton; "to-morrow, eleventh hour!" Edward quitted house, delivered letters credence; one importance moment one credit; others various members Parliament, desiring know Master Armitage confidential friend intendant, and, case need, exert good offices his behalf. The letter credit upon Hamburgh merchant, asked Edward he required money. Edward replied he present, he business his employer north, might require there, possible obtain far London. "When set out, town go?" "That I well tell to-morrow." "Call leave this, I find means providing wish." Edward returned hotel. Before he went bed, he told Sampson he found he leave London Mr. Heatherstone's affairs, might absent time; he concluded observing he consider necessary take him, he could dispense his services, Mr. Heatherstone would glad back. "As wish, sir," replied Sampson. "When I go back?" "You may leave to-morrow soon please. I letter send. You may tell I well, write soon I thing positive communicate." Edward made Sampson present, wished pleasant journey. At hour appointed following day, Edward repaired Mr. Langton, received cordially. "I ready you, Master Armitage; letter two Catholic ladies Lancashire, take great care you; one friend mine Yorkshire. The ladies live four miles town Bolton, Yorkshire friend city York. You may trust them. And now, farewell; and, possible, leave London nightfall--the sooner better. Where servant?" "He returned Master Heatherstone morning." "You done right. Lose time leave London; do not hurry future plans. You understand me. If one accosts road, put trust professions. You, course, going relations north. Have pistols?" "Yes, sir; I pair belong unfortunate Mr. Ratcliffe." "Then good ones, I will answer it; man particular his weapons, knew use better. Farewell, Master Armitage, may success attend you!" Mr. Langton held his hand Edward, respectfully took his leave. CHAPTER XXII. Edward certain Mr. Langton would advised leave London he considered dangerous remain. He therefore first called upon Hamburgh merchant, who, upon his explanation, gave letter credit friend resided city York; returned hotel, packed his saddle-bags, paid his reckoning, and, mounting his horse, set northern road. As late afternoon he clear metropolis, he proceed farther Barnet, he pulled inn. As soon he seen his horse attended to, Edward, his saddle-bags his arm, went room inn travelers congregated. Having procured bed, given his saddle-bags charge hostess, he sat fire, which, although warm weather, nevertheless kept alight. Edward made alteration dress he worn since he received house Mr. Heatherstone. It plain, although good materials. He wore high-crowned hat, and, altogether, would, his attire, taken one Roundhead party. His sword shoulder-belt indeed gay appearance usually worn Roundheads; difference. When Edward first entered room, three persons it, whose appearance prepossessing. They dressed gay attire, exhibited tarnished lace, stains wine, arid dust traveling. They eyed he entered his saddle-bags, one said-- "That is fine horse riding, sir. Has he much speed?" "He has," replied Edward, he turned away went bar speak hostess, give his property her care. "Going north, sir?" inquired person Edward returned. "Not exactly," replied Edward, walking window avoid conversation. "The Roundhead stilts," observed another party. "Yes," replied first; "it easy see he accustomed addressed gentlemen; half pin I would slit his ears!" Edward choose reply; he folded his arms looked man contempt. The hostess, overheard conversation, called her husband, desired go room prevent insults young gentleman come in. The host, knew parties, entered room, said-- "Now you will clear fast can; you, go stables, I will send somebody like." The three men rose swaggered, obeyed host's orders, left room. "I sorry, young master, roisterers affronted you, wife tells have. I know house. We well refuse take horses; know well are, and, traveling far, better ride company." "Thank caution, good host," replied Edward; "I thought highwaymen, something sort." "You made good guess, sir; nothing yet proved them, would here. In times strange customers, hardly know take in. You good sword there, sir, I doubt; I trust arms." "I have," replied Ed ward, opening his doublet, showing his pistols. "That is right, sir. Will take thing go bed?" "Indeed I will, I hungry; thing do, pint wine." As soon he supped, Edward asked hostess his saddle-bags, went his bed. Early next morning he rose went stable see his horse fed. The three men stables, say thing him. Edward returned inn, called breakfast, soon he finished, took his pistols renew priming. While occupied, he happened look up, perceived one men his face window, watching him. "Well, see expect, try trade me," thought Edward. "I glad spying." Having replaced his pistols, Edward paid his reckoning, went stable, desiring hostler saddle his horse fix his saddle-bags. As soon done, he mounted rode off. Before he well clear town, highwaymen cantered past three well-bred active horses. "I presume shall meet again," thought Edward, time cantered gentle pace, then, his horse fresh, he put faster pace, intending long day's work. He ridden fifteen miles, he came heath, and, he continued fast trot, he perceived three highwaymen quarter mile advance him; descending hill them, he soon lost sight again. Edward pulled his horse let recover his wind, walked gently hill. He nearly gained summit he heard report firearms, soon afterward man horseback, full speed, galloped hill toward him. He pistol his hand, his head turned back. The reason soon evident, immediately appeared three highwaymen pursuit. One fired his pistol man fled, missed him. The man fired return, true aim, one highwaymen fell. All sudden, Edward hardly time draw his pistol put spurs his horse, parties upon him, passing him. Edward leveled second highwayman he passed him, man fell. The third highwayman, perceiving this, turned his horse side road, cleared ditch, galloped away across heath. The man attacked pulled his horse Edward came his assistance, rode him, saying, "I thank you, sir, timely aid; rascals many me." "You hurt, I trust, sir?" replied Edward. "No, least; fellow singed curls though, may perceive. They attacked half mile here. I proceeding north I heard clatter hoofs behind me; I looked round saw were, I sprung horse road thicket close it, might surround me. One three rode forward stop passage, two rode round back thicket get behind me. I saw I separated them, could gain start upon riding back again, I did, fast I could, immediately gave chase. The result saw. Between us broken gang; fellows seem dead, nearly so." "What shall them?" "Leave are," replied stranger. "I hurry get on. I important business city York, waste time depositions, nonsense. It two scoundrels less world, there is end matter." As Edward equally anxious proceed, he agreed stranger, best he proposed. "I also going north," replied Edward, "and anxious get soon I can." "With permission ride together," said stranger. "I shall gainer, I shall feel I one trusted case attacks journey." There gentlemanlike, frank, courteous air stranger, Edward immediately assented his proposal, riding company mutual protection. He powerful, well-made man, apparently one two-and-twenty, remarkably handsome person, dressed richly, gaudily, Cavalier fashion, wore hat feather. As proceeded, entered conversation indifferent matters time, neither party attempting question discover his companion might be. Edward once, conversation flagged minute, considered reply he give case his companion ask his journey, last made his mind say. A little noon pulled bait horses small village; stranger observing he avoided St. Alban's, large towns, he wish satisfy curiosity people, his motions watched; therefore, Edward objection, he knew country well, he could save time allowing direct path. Edward was, may supposed, agreeable this, and, whole journey, never entered town, except rode dark; put humble inns roadside, where, quite well attended to, events free observation. It was, however, impossible reserve could continue long, became intimate every day. At last stranger said, "Master Armitage, traveled together time, interchanging thoughts feelings, due reserve respects plans. Is continue? If so, course say so; feel inclined trust me, I feeling toward you. By dress I imagine belonged party I opposed; language manners agree attire; I think hat feathers would grace head better steeple-crowned affair covers it. It may dress assumed disguise: know best. However, I say, I feel confidence you, whatever party may belong, I give credit prudence reserve troubled times. I little older you, may advise you; I indebted you, therefore betray you--at least I trust believe so." "I believe it," replied Edward; "and I far answer you, Master Chaloner, attire mine one I would wear, I choice." "I believe that," replied Chaloner; "and I help thinking bound north business myself, is, I confess honestly, strike blow king. If errand, I two old relations Lancashire, stanch because; I going house remain I join army. If wish it, shall come me, I promise kind treatment safety roof." "And names relatives yours, Master Chaloner?" said Edward. "Nay, shall them; I trust, I trust wholly. Their name Conynghame." Edward took his letters his side-pocket, handed one his fellow-traveler. The address was, "To worthy Mistress Conynghame, Portlake, near Bolton, county Lancashire." "It address I going myself," said Edward, smiling. "Whether party refer to, best know." Chaloner burst loud laugh. "This excellent! Two people meet, bound business, going rendezvous, three days venture trust other." "The times require caution," replied Edward, he replaced his letter. "You right," answered Chaloner, "and opinion. I know prudence courage. The first quality scarcer us Cavaliers last; however, now, reserve over, least part." "And mine also," replied Edward. Chaloner talked chances war. He stated King Charles's army good state discipline, well found everything; hundreds England would join it, soon advanced far enough England; every thing wore promising appearance. "My father fell battle Naseby, head his retainers," said Chaloner, pause; "and contrived fine property, dwindled thousands hundreds. Indeed, good old aunts, leave estates, supply liberally, I poor gentleman." "Your father fell Naseby?" said Edward. "Were there?" "I was," replied Chaloner. "My father also fell Naseby," said Edward. "Your father did?" replied Chaloner; "I recollect name--Armitage--he command there, he?" continued Chaloner. "Yes, he was," replied Edward. "There none name among officers I recollect, young sir," replied Chaloner, air distrust. "Surely misinformed." "I spoken truth," replied Edward; "and said much I must, remove suspicion say perhaps I done. My name Armitage, although I called time. You set example confidence, I follow it. My father Colonel Beverley, Prince Rupert's troop." Chaloner started astonishment. "I am sure say true," last said he; "for I thinking reminded of. You picture father. Although boy time, I knew well, Master Beverley; gallant Cavalier never drew sword. Come, must sworn friends life death, Beverley," continued Chaloner, extending his hand, eagerly grasped Edward, confided Chaloner history his life. When he concluded, Chaloner said, "We heard firing Arnwood, moment believed children perished. It one tales woe nurses repeat children, many child wept supposed deaths. But tell me, now, fallen me, intention joined army assumed name Armitage?" "I hardly know I intended do. I wanted friend advise me." "And found one, Beverley. I owe life you, I repay debt far power. You must conceal name sovereign; name Beverley passport, son Colonel Beverley indeed welcomed. Why, name considered harbinger good fortune. Your father best truest soldier ever drew sword; his memory stands unrivaled loyalty devotion. We near end journey; yonder steeple Bolton church. The old ladies wits find Beverley roof." Edward much delighted tribute paid his father's memory; tears started his eyes Chaloner renewed his praise. Late evening arrived Portlake, grand old mansion situated park crowded fine old timber. Chaloner recognized, rode avenue, one keepers, hastened forward announce his arrival; domestics opened door arrived it. In hall met old ladies, expressed delight seeing nephew, great fear something happened him. "And something nearly happen me," replied Chaloner, "had timely assistance friend here, who, notwithstanding his Puritan attire, I hardly need tell you, Cavalier devoted good because, I state he son Colonel Beverley, fell Naseby good father." "No one welcome, then," replied old ladies, extended hands Edward. They went sitting-room, supper ordered sent immediately. "Our horses well attended to, Edward," said Chaloner; "we need longer look ourselves. And now, good aunts, letters me?" "Yes, several; better eat first." "Not so; let letters; read supper, talk table." One ladies produced letters, Chaloner, he read them, handed Edward his perusal. They General Middleton, friends Chaloner's army, giving information going on, prospects supposed be. "You see marched already," said Chaloner, "and I think plan good one, put General Cromwell awkward position. Our army his London, three days' march advance. And shall able pick English adherents, join us without risk, go along. It bold step, good one; continue well begun, shall succeed. The Parliamentary army equal numbers, is; shall add dayly. The king sent Isle Man Earl Derby, expected join to-morrow." "And army moment?" inquired Edward. "They miles us to-night, march rapid; to-morrow join, pleases." "Most willingly," replied Edward. After hour's conversation, shown rooms, retired night. CHAPTER XXIII. The next morning, quitted beds, messenger arrived letters General Middleton, found king's army encamped evening six miles Portlake. As hastily dressed themselves, Chaloner proposed Edward little alteration his dress would necessary; taking wardrobe put aside suits his own, worn he younger slighter-made man he was, he requested Edward make use them. Edward, aware Chaloner right his proposal, selected two suits colors pleased most; dressing one, changing his hat one befitting his new attire, transformed handsome Cavalier. As soon broken fast took leave old ladies, mounting horses set camp. An hour's ride brought outposts; communicating officer duty, conducted orderly tent General Middleton, received Chaloner great warmth old friend, courteous Edward soon he heard he son Colonel Beverley. "I wanted you, Chaloner," said Middleton; "we raising troop horse; Duke Buckingham commands it, Massey real leader it; influence county, will, I doubt, bring us many good hands." "Where Earl Derby?" "Joined us morning; marched quick time pick adherents up." "And General Leslie?" "Is means good spirits: why, I know not. We many ministers army, certain, harm; help ourselves. His majesty must visible time; ready, I introduce you; and, done, talk matters over." General Middleton walked house king taken his quarters night; minutes' waiting anteroom, admitted his presence. "Allow me, majesty," said General Middleton, first salutations, "to present Major Chaloner, whose father's name unknown you." "On contrary, well known us," replied king, "as loyal faithful subject whose loss must deplore. I doubt his son inherits his courage his fidelity." The king held his hand, Chaloner bent his knee kissed it. "And now, majesty surprised I present one house supposed extinct--the eldest son Colonel Beverley." "Indeed!" replied his majesty; "I heard his family perished ruthless burning Arnwood. I hold fortunate, king, even one son loyal brave gentleman Colonel Beverley escaped. You welcome, young sir--most welcome us; must near us; name Beverley pleasing ears night day." Edward knelt kissed his majesty's hand, king said-- "What Beverley? let us know, may show feelings toward his father's memory." "All I request is, majesty allow near hour danger," replied Edward. "A right Beverley reply," said king; "and shall see it, Middleton." After courteous words his majesty, withdrew, General Middleton recalled king minute two receive his commands. When he rejoined Edward Chaloner, he said Edward-- "I orders send his majesty's signature commission captain horse, attached king's personal staff; high compliment memory father, sir, and, I may add, personal appearance. Chaloner see uniforms accouterments; well mounted, I believe; time lose, march to-morrow Warrington, Cheshire." "Has thing heard Parliamentary army?" "Yes; march toward London Yorkshire road, intending cut us can. And now, gentlemen, farewell; I idle time, I assure you." Edward soon equipped, attended upon king. When arrived Warrington, found body horse drawn oppose passage onward. These charged, fled trifling loss; known commanded Lambert, one Cromwell's best generals, great exultation king's army; fact was, Lambert acted upon Cromwell's orders, harass delay march king much possible, risk his small force thing like engagement. After skirmish considered advisable send back Earl Derby many officers importance Lancashire, might collect king's adherents quarter Cheshire. Accordingly earl, two hundred officers gentlemen, left army intention. It considered would advisable march army direct London; men fatigued rapidity march present time, weather warm, decided negative; Worcester town well affected king, country abounded provisions, resolved army march there, wait English re-enforcements. This done; city opened gates every mark satisfaction, supplied army required. The first bad news reached dispersion defeat whole Earl Derby's party, regiment militia surprised Wigan night, asleep, idea enemy near them. Although attacked disadvantage, defended till large portion killed, remainder taken prisoners, brutally put death. The Earl Derby made prisoner, put death others. "This bad news, Chaloner," said Edward. "Yes; bad," replied latter; "we lost best officers, never left army; consequences defeat be, shall people come forward join us. The winning side right side world; evil that; Duke Buckingham claimed command army, king refused, beginning fight among ourselves. General Leslie evidently dispirited, thinks bad because. Middleton man his duty. Depend upon it, shall Cromwell upon us aware it; state sad confusion: officers quarreling, men disobedient, much talking, little doing. Here five days, works proposed thrown defenses, yet begun." "I admire patience king, much harass annoy him." "He must patient, perforce," replied Chaloner; "he plays crown, high stake; he command minds men, although he may persons. I croaker, Beverley, succeed army, present disorganized, shall perform miracle." "We must hope best," replied Edward; "common danger may cement would otherwise asunder; army Cromwell them, may induced forget private quarrels jealousies, unite good because." "I wish I could opinion, Beverley," replied Chaloner; "but I mixed world longer have, I think otherwise." Several days passed, defenses thrown up, confusion quarreling army continued increase, last news arrived Cromwell within half day's march them, he collected militia his route, numbers nearly double king's army. All amazement confusion--nothing done--no arrangements made--Chaloner told Edward lost immediate steps taken. On 3d October, army Cromwell appeared sight. Edward horseback, attending king, best part night; disposition troops made well could; concluded, Cromwell's army remained quiet, attempt would made day. About noon king returned his lodging, take refreshment his fatigue. Edward him; hour passed, alarm came armies engaged. The king mounted his horse, ready saddled door; he could ride city, he met nearly beaten back whole body almost his cavalry, came running force he could stop them. His majesty called several officers name, paid attention; great panic, king his staff, attended him, nearly overthrown, trampled foot. Cromwell passed large portion his troops river without knowledge opponents, attack made unexpected quarter, panic ensued. Where General Middleton Duke Hamilton commanded, brave resistance made; Middleton wounded, Duke Hamilton his leg taken round-shot, many gentlemen fallen, troops, deserted remainder army, last gave way, rout general, foot throwing away muskets discharged. His majesty rode back town, found body horse, persuaded Chaloner make stand. "Follow me," said his majesty; "we see enemy about. I think pursue, so, may yet rally foolish panic." His majesty, followed Edward, Chaloner, several his personal staff, galloped reconnoiter; his mortification he found troops followed him, gone town gate, enemy's cavalry pursuit actually town. Under circumstances, advice Chaloner Edward, his majesty withdrew, and, turning his horse's head, he made haste leave Worcester. After several hours' riding, king found company 4000 cavalry disgracefully fled; still panic-struck he could put confidence them, advised him, he resolved quit them. This he without mentioning his intention his staff, even Chaloner Edward--leaving night two his servants, he dismissed soon daylight, considering his chance escape would greater he quite alone. It till next morning discovered king left them, determined separate, and, major portion Scotland, make haste could back country. And Chaloner Edward consulted plans. "It appears me," said Edward, laughing, "that danger campaign consist getting back homes, I safely assert I yet struck blow king." "That true enough, Beverly. When purpose going back New Forest? I think, permit me, I accompany you," said Chaloner. "All pursuit northward, intercept overtake retreat Scotland. I therefore go Lancashire; and, indeed, know I out, looking every where." "Then come me," said Edward, "I find protection till decide do. Let us ride away this, talk matter go; depend upon it, south get safer shall be, still safe, unless change costume. There strict search king south, presume he try get safe France. Hark! that? I heard report arms. Let us ride hill see going on." They so, perceived skirmish party Cavaliers Parliamentary cavalry, quarter mile distant. "Come, Chaloner, let us events one blow," said Edward. "Agreed," replied Chaloner, spurring his horse; went full speed, minute melee, coming rear Parliamentary troops. This sudden attack behind decided affair. The Parliamentary troopers, thinking two coming upon them, made another minute's combat, leaving five six men ground. "Thanks, Chaloner! thanks, Beverley!" said voice immediately recognized. It Grenville, one king's pages. "These fellows run, come aid. I remain longer, join permit me. At events, remain till go away--I send off." Grenville said men, "My lads, must separate, chance escape. No two ride together. Depend upon it, shall troops directly." The men, fifteen number, company Grenville, considered Chaloner's advice good, without ceremony set off, horses' heads northward, leaving Chaloner, Edward, Grenville together field affray. About dozen men lying ground, either dead severely wounded: seven king's party, five Parliamentary troops. "Now, I propose," said Edward, "is this: let us wounded, strip dresses accouterments Parliamentary dragoons dead, dress them, accouterments all. We pass country safety, shall supposed one parties looking king." "That good idea," replied Chaloner, "and sooner done better." "Well," said Edward, wiping his sword, he still held drawn, sheathing it, "I take spoils fellow nearest me: he fell hand, I entitled laws war chivalry; first, let us dismount look wounded." They tied horses tree, given assistance could wounded men, proceeded strip three Parliamentary troopers; laying aside habiliments, dressed uniform enemy, and, mounting horses, made haste place. Having gained twelve miles, pulled horses, rode leisurely pace. It eight of the clock evening, still dark; therefore rode another five miles, till came small village, dismounted ale-house, put horses stable. "We must insolent brutal manners, shall suspected." "Very true," said Grenville, giving hostler kick, telling bestir himself, he want his ears cropped. They entered ale-house, soon found held great terror. They ordered every thing best produced, threatened set fire house not; turned man his wife bed, three went sleep it; and, short, behaved arbitrary manner, nobody doubted Cromwell's horse. In morning set Chaloner's advice, paying nothing ordered, although plenty money. They rode fast, inquiring places passed through, whether fugitives seen, and, came town, inquiring, entered, whether Parliamentary troops. So well manage, four days gained skirts New Forest, concealed thicket till night-time, Edward proposed he conduct his fellow-travelers cottage, he would leave till his plans adjusted. Edward already arranged his plans. His great object ward suspicion he been, and, course, idea intendant party his acts; fortunate change his dress enabled success. He decided conduct his two friends cottage night, next morning ride his Parliamentary costume intendant's house, bring first news success Cromwell defeat Worcester; stratagem would appear he Parliamentary, Jacobite, army. As traveled along, found news Cromwell's success yet arrived: times rapidity communication have, Edward thought probable he would first communicate intelligence intendant resided near him. As soon dusk three travelers left retreat, and, guided Edward, soon arrived cottage. Their appearance first created little consternation, Humphrey Pablo happened yard, heard clattering swords accouterments, gloom observed, advanced, party troopers. At first, Humphrey running barring door; but, second reflection, he felt he could imprudent thing danger; he therefore contented hastily imparting intelligence his sisters, remaining threshold meet coming parties. The voice Edward calling name dissipated alarm, another minute he arms his brother sisters. "First, let us take horses stables, Humphrey," said Edward, first greeting over, "and come partake thing Alice prepare us, fared well last three days." Accompanied Humphrey Pablo, went stables, turned ponies make room horses; soon fed littered down, returned cottage, Chaloner Grenville introduced. Supper soon table, hungry talk eating, little information gleaned night. However, Humphrey ascertained lost, escaped field previous Alice Edith leaving room prepare beds new-comers. When beds ready, Chaloner Grenville retired, Edward remained half hour Humphrey, communicate passed. Of course he could enter detail; told he would get information new guests he left, he must early morning. "And now, Humphrey, advice this. My two friends remain cottage, many reasons; key Clara's cottage, take lodging there, supply want, find means going abroad, intention. I must intendant's to-morrow, day I come you. In mean time, guests remain here, Pablo prepare cottage them; I return every thing shall settled, conduct it. I think much danger discovered remain there, certainly much here; must expect parties troops every direction now, king's father made his escape Hampton Court. And bed, good brother; call early, I much fear I shall wake not." The brothers parted night. The next morning, long guests awake, Edward called Humphrey, found Pablo door his horse. Edward, put his Parliamentary accouterments, bade hasty farewell them, set across forest house intendant, he arrived left bedrooms. The first person he encountered was, fortunately, Oswald, his cottage door. Edward beckoned him, one hundred yards off; Oswald recognize first, advanced toward leisurely manner, ascertain trooper might wish inquire. But Edward called Oswald, sufficient. In words Edward told lost, he escaped changing clothes one enemy. "I come bring news intendant, Oswald. You understand me, course?" "Of course I do, Master Edward, take care well known fighting side Cromwell time. I recommend show dress remainder day, every one satisfied. Shall I go intendant's you?" "No, no, Oswald; intendant require introduced him, course. I must gallop his house announce myself. Farewell present--I shall see day." Edward put spurs his horse, arrived intendant's full speed, making small clattering yard he went in, much surprise Sampson, came ascertain because, little surprised perceiving Edward, threw horse, desiring Sampson take stable, entered kitchen, disturbed Phoebe, preparing breakfast. Without speaking her, Edward passed intendant's room, knocked. "Who there?" said intendant. "Edward Armitage," reply; door opened. The intendant started back sight Edward trooper's costume. "My dear Edward, I glad see dress, requires explanation. Sit tell all." "All soon told, sir," replied Edward, taking his iron skull-cap, allowing his hair fall his shoulders. He then, words, stated happened, means he escaped, reason he kept trooper's accouterments, made his appearance them. "You done prudently," replied intendant, "and probably saved me; events, warded suspicion, spies upon nothing report, except favor. Your absence commented upon, made known high quarters, suspicion arisen consequence. Your return one Parliamentary forces put end ill-natured remarks. My dear Edward, done service. As secretary, known follower Beverleys, absence considered strange, intimated high quarters gone join king's forces, knowledge consent. This I Langton; consequence injured little: appearance make right again. Now first prayers, breakfast; detailed account taken place since departure. Patience Clara sorry recover companion; like dress I pretend say. However, I thank God returned safe us; I shall happy see attend peaceful garb secretary." "I will, permission, sir, quit costume one day, may well I seen it." "You right, Edward: day retain it; to-morrow resume usual costume. Go parlor; find Patience Clara anxiously waiting you, I doubt. I join ten minutes." Edward left room, went stairs. It hardly need said joyfully he received Patience Clara. The former, however, expressed her joy tears--the latter, wild mirth. We pass explanations narrative occurred, given Edward Mr. Heatherstone his room. The intendant said, he concluded. "Edward, must perceive that, present, nothing done; pleases Lord, time come monarch reseated his throne; present, must bow powers be; I tell frankly, opinion Cromwell aims sovereignty obtain it. Perhaps may better suffer infliction time, time upheld, may king schooled fitted reign than, told course narrative, he present appears be." "Perhaps so, sir," replied Edward. "I must say short campaign I gone much opened eyes. I seen little true chivalric feeling, much interested motives, joined king's forces. The army collected composed discordant elements, discontented, full jealousy ill-will, I surprised result. One thing certain, must much better feeling existing parties man Cromwell ever moved his position; and, present, may considered lost." "You right, Edward," replied intendant; "I would better, are, let us make best them. You seen enough subdued fiery zeal previously occupied whole thoughts; let us prudent, try happy." CHAPTER XXIV. It Oswald Edward made known occurred; he knew he trusted. The next day, Edward resumed his forester's dress, another one preparing him, went cottage, where, consent intendant, he proposed remaining days. Of course, Edward failed acquaint intendant his proposed plans relative Chaloner Grenville, received his consent; time advising gain side Channel soon possibly could. Edward found anxious his arrival. Humphrey Pablo cottage, found undisturbed since capture robbers, made every thing ready reception two Cavaliers, as, first journey, took cart-load knew would necessary. Chaloner Grenville appeared quite home already, willing shift quarters. They, course, still retained troopers' clothes, wear could procured Lymington; but, mentioned, want money. They amusing girls Humphrey description occurred campaign, Edward found he little tell them, Chaloner commenced his narrative account his first meeting Edward he attacked highwaymen. As soon he could get away, Edward went Humphrey conversation him. "Now, Humphrey, pretty well heard adventures since separation, let hear doing." "I tales stirring interest narrate Chaloner deputy, Edward," replied Humphrey. "All I say is, visitors--that longed return--and idle since quitted us." "What horses stable," said Ed ward, "that turned make room arrived?" Humphrey laughed, informed Edward manner succeeded capturing them. "Well, really deserve credit, Humphrey, certainly born secluded forest." "I rather think I found I born it," replied Humphrey, "although, I must confess, since quitted us, I felt contented I before. You returned, idea alteration I see since mixed world, party stirring scenes." "Perhaps so, Humphrey," replied Edward; "and yet know, that, although I ardently wished mix world, follow wars, I thing satisfied I seen it; far feeling inclination return it, I rather feel inclined remain here, remain quiet peace. I disappointed, truth. There great difference world fancy pining it, world actually placed within vortex, perceive secret springs men's actions. I gained lesson, satisfactory one, Humphrey; may told words. It deceitful hollow world! said words." "What agreeable, pleasant young men Master Chaloner Grenville," observed Humphrey. "Chaloner I know well," replied Edward; "he trusted, he one I able place confidence, therefore I fortunate falling I first starting. Grenville, I know little about; met often, true, presence king, us his staff; time, I must acknowledge I know nothing him; I know, is, he brave." Edward narrated passed intendant since his return; well satisfied intendant his ruse returning dress trooper. "Talking that, Edward, think likely shall troopers search king?" "I wonder already," replied Edward. "And shall arrive?" "That prepared for," replied Edward; "although, till mentioned it, I quite forgotten it. The intendant talking subject last night, appointment verderer, signed him, use may find necessary; another missive, ordering receive house two troopers may sent here, find quarters victuals, compelled receive more. Until search over, Chaloner Grenville must retain accouterments remain us. And, Humphrey, made use clothes I left here--I mean first dress I made I appointed secretary, I thought rather faded wear longer--I put now, military come scouters intendant, I shall authority them." "It chest, left it, Edward. The girls propose make two josephs winter wear, never thought since, time. By-the-by, told think Alice Edith long absence." "I think much grown much improved," replied Edward; "but I must confess I think high time were, possible, removed present homely occupations, instructed young ladies be." "But how, Edward, be?" "That I yet tell, grieves I not; still I see necessity it, ever return position society." "And ever return?" "I do not know. I thought little I went away mixed society; since I world, I compelled feel dear sisters sphere, I resolved upon trying I find suitable position them. Had successful I difficulty, I hardly know do." "I inquired Mistress Patience, brother; she?" "She good handsome ever, much grown; indeed, she becoming quite womanly." "And Clara?" "Oh, I perceive difference her: I think she grown, I hardly observed her. Here comes Chaloner; tell arrangements case disturbed military parties." "It excellent arrangement," said Chaloner, Edward made communication; "and lucky day I first fell you, Beverley." "Not Beverley, I pray you; name forgotten; revived occasion." "Very true; then, Master Secretary Armitage, I think arrangement excellent: point find troops sent direction, must course belong regiment, pursued field battle. I think Lambert's squadrons way." "We soon ascertain that; let horses saddled accoutered, make appearance, horses may door. It opinion time to-day." "I fear almost impossible king escape," observed Chaloner. "I hardly know think his leaving us way." "I reflected upon it," replied Edward, "and I think perhaps prudent: trusted not; impossible know not--he therefore trusted nobody. Besides, his chance escape, quite alone, greater company." "And yet I feel little mortified he trust me," continued Edward; "my life his service." "He could read heart, he could mine others," observed Chaloner; "and selection would invidious: whole, I think he acted wisely, I trust prove so. One thing certain, is, now, long may let swords rest scabbards. Indeed, I sickened it, I seen, would gladly live you, help till land, away world vexations. What say you, Edward; brother take laborer till quiet again?" "You would soon tire it, Chaloner; made active exertion bustling world." "Nevertheless, I think, two amiable pretty mistresses, I could stay well contented here; almost Arcadian. But still selfish talk way; indeed, feelings contrary words." "How mean, Chaloner?" "To candid you, Edward, I thinking pity two sweet girls sisters employed domestic drudgery, remain uncultivated state--if I may pardoned speaking freely--but I I convinced that, proper hands, would grace court; must feel I right." "Do think feelings passed mind, Chaloner? Indeed, Humphrey tell speaking subject hour ago. You must, however, aware difficulty I in: I possession Arnwood domain, indeed--but now, I presume I shall shortly see property, whose woods sight me, made Roundhead, good services Cavaliers Worcester." "Edward," replied Chaloner, "I say you, I say know I indebted life, debt nothing cancel: time determine upon removing sisters this, recollect maiden aunts Portlake. They better hands, hands person religiously duty toward them, pleased trust confided them. They rich, spite exactions; times, women fined plundered men are; well able afford taken them, voluntarily given assistance party. They alone, I really believe nothing would make happy care two sisters Edward Beverley--be sure that. But I sure find means sending letter I shall write them. I tell favor, accept offer, sacrifice sisters' welfare pride--which I think would do." "Most certainly I that," replied Edward; "and I fully sensible kind offer; I say I hear good aunts may reply letter. You mistake much, Chaloner, think sense obligation would prevent seeing sisters removed position unworthy them, circumstances driven to. That paupers, undeniable, I never shall forgot sisters daughters Colonel Beverley." "I delighted reply, Edward, I fear good aunts. It great happiness I wandering abroad know sisters roof, educated ought be." "What is matter, Pablo?" said Humphrey former, came running, breath. "Soldiers," said Pablo, "plenty them, gallop way--gallop every way." "Now, Chaloner, must get scrape, I trust afterward well," said Edward. "Bring horses door; and, Chaloner, Grenville must wait within; bring horse also, appear I ridden over. I must change dress. Humphrey, keep look-out let us know come." Chaloner Edward went in, Edward put his dress secretary. Shortly afterward, party Roundhead cavalry seen galloping toward cottage. They soon arrived there, pulled horses. An officer headed addressed Humphrey haughty tone, asked he was. "I one verderers forest, sir," replied Humphrey, respectfully. "And whose cottage that? there?" "The cottage mine, sir; two horses door belong two troopers come quest fled Worcester, horse belongs secretary intendant forest, Master Heatherstone, come directions intendant capture rebels." At moment, Edward came saluted officer. "This secretary, sir, Master Armitage," said Humphrey, falling back. Edward saluted officer, said-- "Master Heatherstone, intendant, sent make arrangements capture rebels. This man ordered lodge two troopers long considered necessary remain; I directions tell officer I may meet, Master Heatherstone his verderers take good care none rebels harbored direction; better troops scour southern edge forest, certain fugitives try embark France." "What regiment troopers belong here?" "I believe Lambert's troop, sir; shall come answer themselves. Tell men come out," said Edward Humphrey. "Yes, sir, hard wake, ridden Worcester; I rouse them." "Nay, I wait," replied officer. "I know none Lambert's troops, information give." "Could take you, sir, leave two men instead them; troublesome people poor man, devour every thing?" said Humphrey, submissively. "No, no," replied officer, laughing, "we know Lambert's people--a friend enemy much them. I power them, must make best it. Forward! men," continued officer, saluting Edward he passed on; minute two far away. "That is well over," observed Edward. "Chaloner Grenville young-looking good-looking Lambert's villains; sight might occasioned suspicion. We must, however, expect visits. Keep good look-out, Pablo." Edward Humphrey went joined party inside cottage, state little suspense colloquy outside. "Why, Alice, dearest! look quite pale!" said Edward, he came in. "I feared guests, Edward. I am sure come cottage, Master Chaloner Master Grenville would never believed troopers." "We thank compliment, Mistress Alice," said Chaloner; "but I think, necessary, I could ruffle swear best, rather worst them. We passed troopers well road here." "Yes, meet troopers." "That is true, shows penetration. I must acknowledge that, troopers, would difficulty; still, among many thousands, must many varieties, would awkward thing officer one troop arrest upon suspicion men belonging another. I think visited I shall sham intoxication--that suspicious." "No, either side," replied Edward. "Come, Alice, eat dinner may ready us." For three four days Parliamentary forces continued scour forest, another visit two paid cottage, without suspicion created, consequence presence Edward his explanations. The parties invariably sent another direction. Edward wrote intendant, informing occurred, requesting permission remain days longer cottage; Pablo, took letter, returned one intendant, acquainting king yet taken; requesting utmost vigilance his part insure his capture, directions search various places, company troopers stationed cottage; or, he like leave cottage, shew letter officer commanding parties search, might act upon suggestions contained it. This letter Edward opportunity showing one two officers, commanding parties, approached cottage, Edward went communicate with, thereby preventing stopping there. At last, fortnight, party forest; gone seaside, look fugitives, several taken. Humphrey took cart Lymington, procure clothes Chaloner Grenville, decided assume verderers forest, would enable carry gun. As soon Humphrey obtained requisite, Chaloner Grenville conducted Clara's cottage, took possession, course never showing outside wood surrounded it. Humphrey lent Holdfast watch, took leave Alice Edith much regret. Humphrey Edward accompanied new abode. It arranged horses remain care Humphrey, stable Clara's cottage. On parting, Chaloner gave Edward letter his aunts; Edward bent his steps toward intendant's house, found company Patience Clara. Edward narrated intendant occurred, intendant approved he done, strongly advising Chaloner Grenville attempt go Continent till pursuit over. "Here is letter I received government, Edward, highly commending vigilance activity pursuit fugitives. It appears officers fell written state admirable dispositions made. It pity, not, Edward, compelled thus deceitful world? Nothing times, wish good, could warrant it. We meet wicked, fight weapons; although treating deserve, conscience must tell us right." "Surely, sir, save lives people committed fault except loyalty king, warrant doing--at least, I hope so." "According Scriptures, I fear not, difficult, question us decide. Let us guided consciences; reproach us, far right." Edward produced letter he received Chaloner, requesting intendant would kindness forward it. "I see," replied intendant; "I forward Langton. I presume obtain credit money. It shall go Thursday." The conference broken up, Edward went see Oswald. CHAPTER XXV. For several days Edward remained home, anxiously awaiting every news arrived; expecting every time capture king would announced, and, great joy, finding hitherto efforts unsuccessful. But question arose Edward's mind, deep reflection. Since proposal sending his sisters away started, he felt great inconvenience his still representing intendant grandson Armitage. His sisters, sent ladies Portlake, must sent without knowledge intendant; so, discovery absence would soon take place, Patience Heatherstone would constantly going cottage; he asked question, whether, kindness confidence intendant shown him, he right longer concealing his birth parentage. He felt he intendant injustice, showing confidence ho deserved. That he justified first, he felt; since joining king's army, events followed, he considered he treating intendant ill, he resolved take first opportunity making confession. But formally, without opportunity might offer, he felt awkward. At last he thought he would make confession Patience, promise secrecy. That he might once; and, he done so, intendant could tax want confidence altogether. He analyzed his feelings toward Patience; he felt dear she become him. During time he army, she seldom his thoughts; although he often society well bred women, he saw one that, his opinion, could compare Patience Heatherstone; still, chance he supporting wife? present, age nineteen, preposterous. Thoughts like ran his mind, chasing other, followed others vague unsatisfactory; and, end, Edward came conclusion, he without penny, known heir Beverley would his disadvantage; he love Patience Heatherstone, chance present obtaining her; he done well present time concealing he intendant, could safely attest he knew he protecting son noted Cavalier; he would confess Patience he was, give reason telling her father, he wish commit letting know his protection. How far reader may satisfied arguments Edward satisfied with, pretend say; Edward young, hardly knew extricate cloak necessity first compelled put on. Edward already satisfied he quite looked upon indifference Patience Heatherstone; he yet certain whether grateful feeling she toward other; she believed beneath her birth, he felt convinced, therefore she could idea he Edward Beverley. It till several days he made his mind he opportunity her alone, Clara Ratcliffe constant companion. However, one evening Clara went out, staid long, carelessly wrapped up, she caught cold; following evening she remained home, leaving Edward Patience take usual walk unaccompanied her. They walked minutes silence, Patience observed, "You grave, Edward, grave ever since return; thing vex beyond failure attempt." "Yes, I have, Patience. I much conscience, know act. I want adviser friend, know find one." "Surely, Edward, father sincere friend, bad adviser." "I grant it; question father me, I advise reason." "Then advise me, Edward, secret moment trusted woman; events advice sincere friend; give credit that." "Yes, much more; I think I shall good advice, therefore accept offer. I feel, Patience, although I justified, first acquaintance father, making known secret importance, yet he put implicit confidence, me, I injustice making communication--that is, far confidence concerned. I consider he right know all, yet I feel would prudent part he know all, knowledge might implicate he present allied. A secret sometimes dangerous; father could say his honor he knew secret, might harm secret became afterward known. Do understand me?" "I say I exactly do; secret wish make known father, think knowledge may harm him. I imagine kind secret may be." "Well, I give case point. Suppose I knew King Charles hidden stable-loft: might case, father ignorant it, his assertion his ignorance would believed; I tell father king there, afterward discovered, see that, confiding secret him, I harm, perhaps bring trouble?" "I perceive now, Edward; mean say know king concealed? for, do, I must beg let father know thing it. As say, would put difficult position, must eventually harm much. There great difference wishing well supporting person. My father wishes king well, I believe, but, time, he take active part, already seen; time, I convinced he would never betray king he knew he was. I say, therefore, secret, keep him, his sake mine, Edward, regard me." "You know much I regard you, Patience. I saw many highborn women I away, none could I see equal Patience Heatherstone, opinion; Patience ever thoughts long absence." "I thank kind feelings toward me," replied Patience; "but, Master Armitage, talking secret." "Master Armitage!" rejoined Edward; "how well know remind me, expression, obscure birth parentage, whenever I apt forget distance I ought observe!" "You wrong!" replied Patience; "but flattered grossly, I called Master Armitage show I disliked flattery, all. I dislike flattery rank, well me; I done person, whatever his condition might be. But forget I said, I mean vex you, punish thinking silly believe nonsense." "Your humility may construe flattery said perfect sincerity truth-that I help," replied Edward. "I might added much more, yet sincere; reminded gentle birth, I might presumption told much more; I rebuked." Edward finished speaking, Patience made reply; walked several moments without exchanging another syllable. At last Patience said, "I say wrong, Edward; I know, one first offers olive branch misunderstanding, right. I offer now, ask whether quarrel one little word. Let ask you, give candid answer: Have I ever base treat inferior one I much obliged?" "It I fault, Patience," replied Edward. "I dreaming long while, pleased dreams, forgetting dreams, likely realized. I must speak plainly. I love you, Patience; love much, part would misery-to know love rejected, bitter death. That truth, I conceal longer. Now I admit right angry." "I see anger, Edward," replied Patience. "I thought friend benefactor; would wrong done otherwise. I young person, must guided father. I would offend disobedience. I thank good opinion me, yet I wish said have." "Am I understand reply, that, father raised objection, lowly birth would none opinion?" "Your birth never come head, except reminded yourself." "Then, Patience, let return present I confide you. I was--" "Here comes father, Edward," said Patience. "Surely I done wrong, I feel afraid meet him." Mr. Heatherstone joined them, said Edward-- "I looking you: I news London rejoiced much. I last obtained I time trying for; and, indeed, I may say, prudence boldness returning home trooper, added conduct forest, greatly advanced, ultimately obtained me, suit. There suspense that, conduct removed it; shall plenty do." They walked house, intendant, soon he gained his room, said Edward-- "There grant property I long solicited services--read it." Edward took letter Parliament informed Mr. Heatherstone his application property Arnwood acceded to, signed commissioners; he might take immediate possession. Edward turned pale he laid document table. "We ride to-morrow, Edward, look over. I intend rebuild house." Edward made reply. "Are well?" said intendant, surprise. "Yes, sir," replied Edward, "I well, I believe; I confess I disappointed. I think would accepted property source, unjustly sequestrated." "I sorry, Edward," replied intendant, "that I fallen good opinion; allow observe far right I never would accepted property living claimants; different case. For instance, Ratcliffe property belongs little Clara, sequestrated. Do think I would accept it? Never! But property without heir; whole family perished flames Arnwood! There living claimant! It must given somebody, remain government. This property, therefore, property only, sequestrated, I selected, I felt that, obtaining it, I harm one. I offered others, refused them. I would accept this, only; reason applications hitherto attended success. I trust believe me, Edward, I assert?" "First answer one question, Mr. Heatherstone. Suppose proved whole family not, supposed, perish conflagration Arnwood? Suppose rightful heir time appear, would resign property him?" "As I hope Heaven, Edward, I would!" replied intendant, solemnly raising his eyes upward he spoke. "I think I instrument keep property hands less scrupulous, surrender trust confided time only." "With feelings, Mr. Heatherstone, I congratulate upon obtained possession property," replied Edward. "And yet I deserve much credit, little chance sincerity put test, Edward. There doubt family perished; Arnwood become dower Patience Heatherstone." Edward's heart beat quick. A moment's thought told his situation. He prevented, interruption Mr. Heatherstone, making his confession Patience; he could make body without rupture intendant, compromise, asking he earnestly desired--the hand Patience. Mr. Heatherstone observing Edward he look well, said supper ready, better go next room. Edward mechanically followed. At supper he tormented incessant inquiries Clara, matter him. He venture look Patience, made hasty retreat bed, complaining, he might well do, severe headache. Edward threw his bed, sleep impossible. He thought events day again. Had he reason believe Patience returned his affection? No; her reply calm, composed make suppose that; she would heiress, would want pretenders her hand; he would lose her his property time. It true intendant declared he would renounce property true heir appeared, easy say upon conviction heir would appear; even he renounce it, Parliament would receive rather fall hands Beverley. "Oh I never left cottage!" thought Edward. "I might then, least, become resigned contented lot. Now I miserable, and, whichever way I turn, I see prospect otherwise. One thing I decide upon, is, I remain longer I help roof. I go consult Humphrey; I place sisters I want, Humphrey I seek fortunes." Edward rose daylight, and, dressing himself, went saddled his horse. Desiring Sampson tell intendant he gone cottage would return evening, he rode across forest, arrived sitting breakfast. His attempts cheerful his sisters succeed, grieved see look pale haggard. As soon breakfast over, Edward made sign, he Humphrey went out. "What matter, dear brother?" said Humphrey. "I tell all. Listen me," replied Edward, gave detail passed time he walked Patience Heatherstone till he went bed. "Now, Humphrey, know all; shall I do? remain I not!" "If Patience Heatherstone professed regard you," replied Humphrey, "the affair simple enough. Her father could objections match; he would time acquitted his conscience retaining property: say she showed none." "She told calmly she sorry I said I did." "But women always mean say, brother?" said Humphrey. "She does, events," replied Edward; "she truth itself. No, I deceive myself. She feels deep debt gratitude service I rendered her; prevented her harsh her reply she was." "But she knew Edward Beverley, think would make difference her?" "And did, would humiliating think I married rank station." "But, considering mean birth, may she checked feelings she considered circumstances improper indulge?" "Where sense propriety little affection." "I know nothing things, Edward," replied Humphrey; "but I told woman's heart easily read; I told it, I read dreamed it." "What propose do?" "What I fear approve of, Humphrey; break establishment altogether. If answer favorable Misses Conynghame sisters shall go them; agreed upon already. Then myself--I intend go abroad, resume name, obtain employment foreign service. I trust king assisting that." "That worst part it, Edward; peace mind depends upon it, I oppose it." "You, Humphrey, may come share fortunes, think preferable." "I think then, Edward, I shall decide rashly. I must remained Pablo sisters gone Ladies Conynghame remained intendant; I shall, therefore, till I hear you, remain I am, shall able observe going here, let know." "Be so," replied Edward; "let see sisters well placed, I shall next day. It misery remain now." After conversation, Edward mounted his horse returned intendant's. He arrive till late, supper table. The intendant gave letter Mr. Chaloner, inclosed one Mr. Langton; informed Edward news arrived king made his escape France. "Thank God that!" exclaimed Edward. "With leave, sir, I to-morrow deliver letter party addressed, I know consequence." The intendant given his consent, Edward retired without exchanged word Patience Clara beyond usual civilities table. The following morning, Edward, slept hour night, set Clara's cottage, found Chaloner Grenville still bed. At sound his voice door opened, he gave Chaloner letter; latter read handed Edward. The Misses Conynghame delighted idea receiving two daughters Colonel Beverley, would treat own; requested might sent London immediately, coach would meet convey Lancashire. They begged kindly remembered Captain Beverley, assure his sisters well cared for. "I much indebted you, Chaloner," said Edward; "I send brother sisters soon possible. You soon think returning France; permit me, I accompany you." "You, Edward! delightful; idea kind last met. What induced alter mind?" "I tell by-and-by; I think I shall days. I must great deal cottage Humphrey away, Pablo great charge upon him--what dairy, horses, breed goats, things--more he attend to; soon Humphrey returns, I come make preparations departure. Till then, farewell, you. We must see provision three weeks month, Humphrey starts." Edward bade hearty farewell, rode cottage. Although Alice Edith somewhat prepared leaving cottage, yet time uncertain, blow fell heavy upon them. They leave brothers loved dearly, go strangers; understood leave two days, see Edward again, grief great; Edward reasoned Alice consoled her, although Edith difficult task. She lamented her brothers, her cow, her pony, her kids; dumb animals friends favorites Edith; even idea parting Pablo, fresh burst tears. Having made every arrangement Humphrey, Edward took his leave, promising come assist Pablo soon he could. The next day Humphrey busied his preparations. They supplied provisions Clara's cottage; Pablo took cart, Humphrey rode Lymington provided conveyance London following day. We may well observe, set hour appointed, arrived safely London three days. There, address given letter, found coach waiting; given his sisters charge elderly waiting-woman, come coach take charge them, quitted many tears, Humphrey hastened back New Forest. On his return, he found his surprise Edward called cottage he promised; mind foreboding evil, he mounted horse set across forest ascertain because. As he close intendant's house he met Oswald, informed Edward seized violent fever, dangerous state, delirious three four days. Humphrey hastened dismount, knocked door house; opened Sampson, Humphrey requested shown his brother's room. He found Edward state described Oswald, wholly unconscious his presence; maid, Phoebe, his bedside. "You may leave," said Humphrey, rather abruptly; "I his brother." Phoebe retired, Humphrey alone his brother. "It was, indeed, unhappy day came house," exclaimed Humphrey, tears rolled his cheeks; "my poor, poor Edward!" Edward began talk incoherently, attempted rise bed, his efforts unavailing--he weak; he raved Patience Heatherstone, he called Edward Beverley once, he talked his father Arnwood. "If he raved manner," thought Humphrey, "he many secrets left disclose. I leave him, keep others away I can." Humphrey sitting hour his brother, surgeon came see his patient. He felt his pulse, asked Humphrey he nursing him. "I his brother, sir," replied Humphrey. "Then, good sir, perceive signs perspiration--and I think little--keep clothes let perspire freely. If so, his life saved." The surgeon withdrew, saying he would return late evening. Humphrey remained another two hours bedside, feeling sign perspiration, he obeyed injunctions surgeon, held clothes Edward's endeavors throw off. For short time perspiration profuse, restlessness Edward subsided deep slumber. "Thank Heaven! hopes." "Did say hopes?" repeated voice behind him. Humphrey turned round perceived Patience Clara behind him, come without his observing it. "Yes," replied Humphrey, looking reproachfully Patience, "there hopes, surgeon said me--hopes he may yet able quit house he unfortunate enter." This harsh rude speech Humphrey; he considered Patience Heatherstone his brother's dangerous state, she behaved well him. Patience made reply, falling her knees bedside, prayed silently; Humphrey's heart smote he said her. "She bad," thought Humphrey, Patience Clara quitted room without least noise. Shortly afterward intendant came room offered his hand Humphrey, pretended see it, take it. "He got Arnwood: enough him," thought Humphrey; "but hand friendship he shall receive." The intendant put his hand within clothes, feeling high perspiration Edward in, said-- "I thank thee, O God! thy mercies, thou hast pleased spare valuable life. How sisters, Master Humphrey?" said intendant; "my daughter bade inquire. I send let know brother better, leave cottage surgeon called again." "My sisters longer cottage, Master Heatherstone," replied Humphrey; "they gone friends taken charge them. I saw safe London myself, I known brother's illness this." "You indeed tell news, Master Humphrey," replied intendant. "With whom, may I ask, sisters placed, capacity gone?" This reply intendant's reminded Humphrey he somewhat committed himself, as, supposed daughters forester, thought gone educated; he therefore replied-- "They found lonely forest, Master Heatherstone, wished see London; taken there, put care promised shall well placed." The intendant appeared much disturbed surprised, he said nothing, soon afterward quitted room. He almost immediately returned surgeon, who, soon he felt Edward's pulse, declared crisis over, he awoke he would quite sensible. Having given directions drink his patient, medicine he take, surgeon left, stating he call next evening, unless he sent for, he considered danger over. Edward continued quiet slumber major portion night. It break day he opened his eyes. Humphrey offered drink, Edward took greedily; seeing Humphrey, said-- "Oh, Humphrey, I quite forgotten I was--I am sleepy!" words his head fell pillow, he asleep. When broad daylight, Oswald came room: "Master Humphrey, say danger now, remained night. I relieve let me. Go take walk fresh air--it revive you." "I will, Oswald, many thanks. My brother woke once, and, I thank God, quite sensible. He know he wakes again, send me." Humphrey left room, glad, night close confinement sick-room, feel cool morning air fanning his cheeks. He long house he perceived Clara coming toward him. "How d'ye do, Humphrey?" said Clara; "and brother morning?" "He better, Clara, I hope danger." "But, Humphrey," continued Clara, "when came room last night, made say did?" "I recollect I said thing." "Yes, did; said hopes brother would able soon quit house he unfortunate enter. Do recollect?" "I may said so, Clara," replied Humphrey; "it speaking thoughts aloud." "But think so, Humphrey? Why Edward unfortunate entering house? That I want know. Patience cried much she left room said that. Why say so? You think short time ago." "No, dear Clara, I not, I now, I give reasons; must say it." Clara silent time, said-- "Patience tells sisters gone away cottage. You told her father so." "It true; gone." "But gone? What gone for? Who look cows, goats, poultry? Who cook dinner, Humphrey? What without them, send away without letting Patience know going, least might bid farewell?" "My dear Clara," replied Humphrey--who, feeling little difficulty replying questions, resolved cut matter short, appearing angry--"you know daughter gentleman, Patience Heatherstone. You gentle birth, sisters, know, daughters forester, brother Edward I better. It become Mistress Patience intimate are, especially Mistress Patience great heiress; her father obtained large property Arnwood, his death. It fit heiress Arnwood mix herself foresters' daughters; friends near Lymington, offered assist us, take sisters charge, thought better go; would become them, accident happen Edward me? Now provided for. After taught, make nice tirewomen lady quality," added Humphrey, sneer. "Do not think will, pretty Clara?" Clara burst tears. "You unkind, Humphrey," sobbed she. "You right send away sisters. I do not believe you--that is more!" Clara ran away house. CHAPTER XXVI. Our readers may think Humphrey unkind, avoid questioned Clara, evidently sent purpose, he harsh. At time must admitted, Mr. Heatherstone obtained possession Arnwood, rankled, doubt, minds brothers, every act now, part his family, viewed false medium. But feelings always control, Edward naturally impetuous, Humphrey much attached, much alarmed his brother's danger, he even excited. The blow fell doubly heavy, appeared time Patience rejected his brother, taken possession property, held family centuries. What made case annoying was, explanation, offer either side, was, present circumstances, almost impossible. Soon Clara left him, Humphrey returned his brother's room. He found awake talking Oswald. Ardently pressing his brother's hand, Edward said-- "My dear Humphrey, I shall soon well now, able, I trust, quit house. What I fear is, explanation asked intendant, relative sisters left us, also upon points. This I wish avoid without giving offense. I think intendant much blame obtained property, he know Beverley existed; I bear intimacy him, especially taken place his daughter. What I request is, never quit room I still unless relieved Oswald; intendant body else may opportunity private communication me, forcing listen may say. I made known Oswald came in." "Depend upon it, shall so, Edward, I opinion. Clara came now, I much trouble, compelled harsh, get rid her importunity." When surgeon called, he pronounced Edward danger, his attendance would longer necessary. Edward felt truth this. All he required strength; he trusted days obtain. Oswald sent cottage, ascertain Pablo going himself. He found every thing correct, Pablo, although he felt proud his responsibility, anxious Humphrey's return, he found lonely. During Oswald's absence day, Humphrey never quitted room; although intendant came several times, he never could find opportunity speaking Edward, he evidently wished do. To inquiries made he was, Edward always complained great weakness, reason soon understood. Several days elapsed, Edward often bed night, likely intruded upon, he felt strong enough removed; his object leave intendant's house without his knowledge, avoid explanation. One evening Pablo came horses dark. Oswald put stable; morning proving fine clear, little break day, Edward came softly stairs Humphrey, and, mounting horses, set cottage, without one intendant's house aware departure. It must supposed, however, Edward took step without degree consideration feelings intendant. On contrary, he left letter Oswald, delivered his departure, he thanked intendant sincerely kindness compassion he shown toward him; assured his gratitude kind feelings toward his daughter, said circumstances occurred, explanation could given without great pain parties, rendered advisable he take apparently unkind step leave without bidding farewell person; he embark immediately Continent, seek his fortune wars; he wished prosperity family, would ever his kindest wishes remembrances. "Humphrey," said Edward, ridden two miles across forest, sun risen unclouded sky, "I feel like emancipated slave. Thank God! sickness cured complaints, I want active employment. And now, Humphrey, Chaloner Grenville little tired mured cottage, I anxious off. What do? Will join us, remain cottage?" "I reflected upon it, Edward, I come determination remaining cottage. You find expensive enough support one going, must appear Beverley do. We plenty money saved equip you, maintain well year so, may require more. Leave here. I make money farm well stocked; I doubt I shall able send trifle every year, support honor family. Besides, I wish leave another reason. I want know going on, watch motions intendant heiress Arnwood. I also wish leave country I know sisters get Ladies Conynghame: duty watch them. I made mind, attempt dissuade me." "I shall not, dear Humphrey, I think decided properly; I beg think laying money me-a little suffice wants." "Not so, good brother; must shall, I help you, ruffle best. You better received do; for, though poverty sin, saying is, scouted sin be, sins winked at. You know I require money, and, therefore, must shall, love me, take all." "As will, dear Humphrey. Now then, let us put horses speed, for, possible, will, to-morrow morning, leave forest." By time search fugitives Worcester long over, difficulty obtaining means embarkation. Early next morning every thing ready, Edward, Humphrey, Chaloner, Grenville, Pablo set Southampton, one horses carrying little baggage them. Edward, mentioned, money he saved, store cottage, greatly increased, well supplied cash; evening embarked, horses, small sailing vessel, and, favorable, light wind, arrived small port France following day. Humphrey Pablo returned cottage, need hardly say, much spirits separation. "Oh, Massa Humphrey," said Pablo, rode along, "Missy Alice Missy Edith go away-I wish go them. Massa Edward go away--I wish go him. You stay cottage--I wish stay you. Pablo three places." "No, Pablo; stay useful." "Yes, I know that. You want cottage much. Missy Alice Edith Massa Edward want me, I stay cottage." "Yes, Pablo, stay cottage, cannot every thing now. I think must give dairy, sisters gone. I will tell I thinking of, Pablo. We make large inclosed place, coax ponies winter, pick many think good, sell Lymington. That better churning butter." "Yes, I see; plenty work Pablo." "And plenty me, too, Pablo; know inclosure made last long while; get wild cattle can." "Yes, I see," said Pablo. "I like much; like trouble build place." "We shall not much trouble, Pablo; fell trees inside wood side, let lie one upon other, animals never break them." "That good idea--save trouble," said Pablo. "And cows, suppose make butter?" "Keep them, sell calves; keep entice wild cattle pen." "Yes, good. And turn old Billy 'tice ponies pen," continued Pablo, laughing. "Yes, try it." We must return intendant's house. Oswald delivered letter intendant, read much astonishment. "Gone! he actually gone?" said Mr. Heatherstone. "Yes, sir, daylight morning." "And I informed it?" said Mr. Heatherstone; "why party proceeding, servant?--may I inquire that?" "I knew Master Edward I knew you, sir," replied Oswald. "Then better follow him," rejoined intendant, angry tone. "Very well, sir," replied Oswald, quitted room. "Good Heaven! plans frustrated!" exclaimed intendant, he alone. He read letter carefully he done first. "'Circumstances occurred explanation could given him.' I comprehend that--I must see Patience." Mr. Heatherstone opened door, called his daughter. "Patience," said Mr. Heatherstone, "Edward left house morning; letter he written me. Read it, let know explain portion it, incomprehensible. Sit read attentively." Patience, much agitated, gladly took seat perused Edward's letter. When she done so, she let drop her lap covered her face, tears trickling her fingers. After time, intendant said, "Patience, thing passed Edward Armitage?" Patience made reply, sobbed aloud. She might shown much emotion, must remembered last three weeks since Edward spoken her, his subsequent illness, she unhappy. The reserve Humphrey, expressions he made use of, his repulse Clara, her seen anything Edward his illness, added his sudden unexpected departure without word her, broken her spirits, she sank beneath load sorrow. The intendant left her recover herself he addressed her. When she ceased sobbing, her father spoke her kind voice, begging her she would conceal thing him, important real facts known. "Now tell me, child, passed Edward you." "He told me, came us evening, he loved me." "And reply?" "I hardly know, dear father, I said. I like unkind one saved life, I choose say I thought because--because--because he low birth; could I give encouragement son forester without permission?" "Then rejected him?" "I suppose I did, he considered I so. He secret importance he would confided interrupted us." "And now, Patience, I must request answer one question candidly. I blame conduct, correct circumstances. I also secret I perhaps ought confided; I consider confidence paternal kindness I treated Edward would sufficient point I could averse union; indeed, freedom communication I allowed you, must told so: sense duty propriety made act ought done, I grant, although contrary real wishes." "Your wishes, father?" said Patience. "Yes--my wishes; nothing I ardently desired union Edward; I wished love his merits." "I done so, father," replied Patience, sobbing again, "although I tell so." The intendant remained silent time, said, "There concealment, Patience; I regret I explicit sooner. I long suspected, since satisfied, Edward Armitage Edward Beverley, his brothers sisters supposed burned death Arnwood." Patience removed her handkerchief her face, looked her father astonishment. "I tell I strong suspicion it, dear child, first, noble appearance, forest garb could disguise; gave conviction was, Lymington I happened fall one Benjamin, servant Arnwood, interrogated closely. He really believed children burned; true I asked particularly relative appearance children--how many boys, many girls, ages, &c.--but strongest proof was, names four children corresponded names Children Forest, well ages, I went church register extracted them. Now almost amounting proof; likely four children forest cottage ages names Arnwood. After I ascertained point, I engaged Edward, know, wishing secure him, I acquainted his father, events well acquainted colonel's merits. You remained house together, pleasure I watched intimacy you; I exerted get Arnwood restored him. I could ask him, I prevented given laying claim myself. Had Edward remained us, might succeeded I wished; he would join unfortunate insurrection. I knew useless prevent him, I let go. I found he took name Beverley time he king's army, I last town I told commissioners, wondered he come from; effect useless request estate him, I wished do--his served royal army rendered impossible. I therefore claimed myself, succeeded. I made mind he attached you, equally him; soon I grant sent down, evening he addressed you, I made known property given me; I added, dry questions put him, relative possibility still existing heir estate, chance that, would mistress Arnwood. I threw hint him, fancying that, far concerned, would go well, I would explain knowledge he was, he made known his regard you." "Yes, I see now," replied Patience; "in one hour he rejected me, next he told I obtained possession his property. No wonder he indignant, looks upon us scorn. And he left us; driven danger, may never see again. Oh, father! I very, miserable!" "We must hope best, Patience. It true he gone wars, therefore follow he killed. You young--much young marry--and may explained. I must see Humphrey candid him.". "But Alice Edith--where gone, father?" "That I inform you. I letter Langton subject, I begged find out. He says two young ladies name Beverley, placed charge his friends, Ladies Conynghame, aunt Major Chaloner, time concealed forest. But I letters write, dear Patience. To-morrow, I live well, I ride cottage see Humphrey Beverley." The intendant kissed his daughter, she left room. Poor Patience! she glad left herself, think strange communication. For many days she felt fond she Edward, much she believed herself be. "And now," she thought, "if he really loves me, hears father's explanation, he come back again." By degrees she recovered her serenity, employed herself her quiet domestic duties. Mr. Heatherstone rode cottage next day, he found Humphrey busily employed usual, and, unusual, extremely grave. It pleasant task Mr. Heatherstone explain his conduct young man Humphrey, he felt he could comfortable evil impression removed, he knew Humphrey great deal sterling good sense. His reception cool; explanation made, Humphrey satisfied, showed intendant best friend, delicacy part Patience, rather because, misunderstanding occurred. Humphrey inquired he permission communicate substance conversation his brother, Mr. Heatherstone stated his wish intention he confided Humphrey. It hardly necessary say Humphrey took earliest opportunity writing Edward direction Chaloner left him. CHAPTER XXVII. But must follow Edward time. On his arrival Paris, he kindly received King Charles, promised assist his views joining army. "You choose two generals, great art war--Conde Turenne. I doubt opposed soon--that better you, learn tactics great players." "Which would majesty recommend follow?" inquired Edward. "Conde favorite, he soon opposed truculent dishonest court, kept instrument accomplish wishes, never intended keep promises, place English throne. I give letters Conde; and, recollect whatever general take service under, follow without pretending calculate far his movements may right wrong--that affair. Conde released Vincennes, depend upon he arms soon." As soon he furnished necessary credentials king, Edward presented levee Prince Conde. "You highly spoken of," said prince, "for young man. So affair Worcester? We retain you, services wanted by-and-by. Can procure countrymen?" "I know two I recommend personal knowledge; two officers I venture pledge for." "Any more?" "That I present reply highness; I think possible." "Bring officers to-morrow hour, Monsieur Beverley--_au revoir_." The Prince Conde passed speak officers gentlemen waiting pay respects. Edward went Chaloner Grenville, delighted intelligence he brought them. The next day prince's levee, introduced Edward. "I fortunate, gentlemen," said prince, "in securing services fine young men. You oblige enlisting many countrymen may consider likely good service, follow Guienne, province I depart. Be pleased put communication parties named paper, absence receive every assistance necessary supplies may required." A month interview, Conde, joined great number nobles, re-enforced troops Spain, set standard revolt. Edward his friends joined them, three hundred English Scotchmen, enlisted, soon afterward Conde obtained victory Blenan, April, 1652, advanced Paris. Turenne, taken command French army, followed him, severe action fought streets suburb St. Antoine, neither party advantage. But eventually Conde beaten back superior force Turenne; and, receiving assistance he expected Spaniards, he fell back frontiers Champagne. Previous his departure Paris, Edward received Humphrey's letter, explaining away intendant's conduct; contents removed heavy load Edward's mind; he thought nothing war, although he cherished idea Patience Heatherstone, he resolved follow fortunes prince long he could. He wrote letter intendant, thanking his kind feelings intentions toward him, he trusted he might one day pleasure seeing again. He however think advisable mention name his daughter, except inquiring her health, sending his respects. "It may years I see her again," thought Edward, "and knows may happen?" The Prince Conde command Spanish forces Netherlands; Edward, his friends, followed his fortunes, gained his good-will: rapidly promoted. Time flew on, year 1654 court France concluded alliance Cromwell, expelled King Charles French frontiers. The war still carried Netherlands. Turenne bore Conde, gained every campaign; court Spain, wearied reverses, made overtures peace, gladly accepted French. During wars, Cromwell named Protector, shortly afterward died. Edward, rarely heard Humphrey, anxious quit army go king, Spain; leave his colors, things adverse, impossible. After peace pardon Conde French king, armies disbanded, three adventurers free. They took leave prince, thanked long meritorious services; hastened King Charles, left Spain come Low Countries. At time joining king, Richard, son Cromwell, nominated Protector, resigned, every thing ready Restoration. On 15th May, 1660, news arrived Charles proclaimed king 8th, large body gentlemen went invite over. The king sailed Scheveling, met Dover General Monk, conducted London, he entered amid acclamations people, 29th month. We may leave reader suppose Edward, Chaloner, Grenville among favored his train. As procession moved slowly along Strand, countless multitude, windows houses filled well-dressed ladies, waved white kerchiefs king his attendant suit. Chaloner, Edward, Grenville, rode side side gentlemen waiting, certainly distinguished among king's retinue. "Look, Edward," said Chaloner, "at lovely girls yon window. Do recognize them?" "Indeed I not. Are Paris beauties?" "Why, thou insensible unnatural animal! thy sisters, Alice Edith; recognize behind good aunts Conynghame?" "It so, I believe," replied Edward. "Yes, Edith smiles, I am sure them." "Yes," replied Grenville, "there doubt that; they, think you, recognize us?" "We shall see," replied Edward, approached within yards window; speaking procession stopped. "Is possible," thought Edward, "that two girls russet gowns, I left cottage? And yet must be. Well, Chaloner, appearance, good aunts done justice charge." "Nature done more, Edward. I never thought would grown lovely girls have, although I always thought handsome." As passed, Edward caught eye Edith, smiled. "Alice, that is Edward!" said Edith, loud, heard king, near him. Alice Edith rose waved handkerchiefs, soon obliged cease, put eyes. "Are sisters, Edward?" said king. "They are, majesty." The king rose his stirrups, made low obeisance window standing. "We shall court beauties, Beverley," said king, looking his shoulder. As soon ceremonies over, could escape personal attentions, Edward his two friends went house resided Ladies Conynghame his sisters. We pass joy meeting many years' absence, pleasure gave Edward find his sisters grown accomplished elegant young women. That his two friends, were, reader recollect, old acquaintances Alice Edith, warmly received, hardly need say. "Now, Edward, think to-day--the reigning belle, toast gentlemen?" "Indeed! I must careful heart. Dear Edith, she?" "No less one formerly well acquainted, Edward--Patience Heatherstone." "Patience Heatherstone," cried Edward, "the toast London!" "Yes; deservedly so, I assure you; she good she handsome, and, moreover, treats gay gallants perfect indifference. She staying her uncle, Sir Ashley Cooper; her father also town, he called her to-day." "When hear Humphrey, Edith?" "A days back. He left cottage now, altogether." "Indeed? Where he reside then?" "At Arnwood. The house rebuilt, I understand princely mansion. Humphrey charge ascertained belong." "It belongs Mr. Heatherstone, not?" replied Edward. "How say so, Edward! You received Humphrey's letters long ago." "Yes, I did; let us talk more, dear Edith. I great perplexity." "Nay, dear brother, let us talk it," said Alice, come overheard latter portion conversation. "What perplexity?" "Well," replied Edward, "since so, let us sit talk matter. I acknowledge kindness Mr. Heatherstone, feel he asserted Humphrey true: still I like I indebted property mine, he right give. I acknowledge his generosity, I acknowledge his right possession. Nay, much I admire, I may say, fond I (for time effaced feeling) his daughter, still appears that, although said, expected she included transfer; I accept wife conditions." "That say, wish for, property woman love, offered one lot, accept them; must divided, handed two!" said Alice, smiling. "You mistake, dearest; I foolish; I certain pride, blame. Accepting property Mr. Heatherstone receiving favor given marriage portion his daughter. Now, I accept favor I claim right! It intention appealing king demanding restoration property. He refuse it." "Put trust princes, brother," replied Alice. "I doubt king, his council, consider advisable make many discontented restore property long held others, create host enemies. Recollect also Mr. Heatherstone, his brother-in-law, Sir Ashley Cooper, done king much service ever do. They important agents his restoration, king's obligations much greater you. Besides, merely may called point honor, more, unpleasant situation put his majesty! At events, Edward, recollect know intentions Mr. Heatherstone; wait see he proffers first." "But, dear sister, appears his intentions evident. Why he rebuilt Arnwood? He going surrender property make present house." "The reason rebuilding mansion good. You wars; possible might, might return. He said Humphrey, along acting his factotum business; recollect, time Mr. Heatherstone commenced rebuilding mansion, prospect restoration king, ever position apply restoration property! I believe, however, Humphrey knows Mr. Heatherstone's intentions he made known us; I therefore say again, dear Edward, make application till ascertain Mr. Heatherstone's intentions may be." "Your advice good, dear Alice, I guided it," replied Edward. "And let give advice friends, Masters Chaloner Grenville. That much property taken away put hands, I know; probably expect restored upon application king. Those hold property think too, far fortunate. Now, wiser heads mine, I told applications acceded to, HM supposed; but, time, meet parties, close once, king's intentions known, would recover property third quarter value. Now time: even days' delay may make difference. They easily obtain delay payment moneys. Impress upon them, dear Edward, let them, possible, estates to-morrow make arrangements." "That advice must followed," replied Edward. "We must go now, I fail communicate night." We may well inform reader advice immediately acted upon, Chaloner Grenville recovered estates five years' purchase. Edward remained court several days. He written Humphrey, dispatched messenger letter; messenger yet returned. The court one continual scene fetes gayety. On following day drawing-room held, Edward's sisters presented. Edward standing, many others suit, behind chair king, amusing presentations took place, waiting arrival his sisters--Chaloner Grenville him, obtained leave go country, object referred to--when his eyes caught, advancing toward king, Mr. Heatherstone, led his daughter, Patience. That perceived evident; indeed her eyes raised once, natural timidity felt young woman presence royalty. Edward half concealed behind one his companions he might gaze upon her without reserve. She indeed lovely young person, little altered, except grown taller rounded perfect her figure; her court-dress displayed proportions her humble costume New Forest concealed, time matured. There pensive, sweet expression her face, altered little; beautiful rounded arms, symmetrical fall shoulders, proportion whole figure surprise him; Edward, his mind, agreed she might well reigning toast day. Mr. Heatherstone advanced made his obeisance, his daughter led forward, introduced lady unknown Edward. After he saluted her, king said, loud enough Edward hear, "My obligations father great. I trust daughter often grace court." Patience made reply, passed on; and, soon afterward, Edward lost sight her crowd. If ever check Edward's feelings toward Patience--and time absence effect upon ardent lovers--the sight her resplendent beauty acted upon like magic; he uneasy till ceremony he enabled go his sisters. When he entered room, he found arms Humphrey, arrived messenger. After greetings over, Edward said, "Alice I seen Patience, I fear I must surrender discretion. Mr. Heatherstone may make his terms; I must wave pride rather lose her. I thought I control myself; I seen her, feel future happiness depends upon obtaining her wife. Let her father give her, Arnwood trifle addition!" "With respect conditions upon possess Arnwood," said Humphrey, "I inform are. They wholly unshackled, repay installments money expended building house. This I empowered state you, I think allow Mr. Heatherstone fully acted he stated his views he first obtained grant property." "He has, indeed," replied Edward. "As his daughter, Edward, yet 'win her wear her,' saying is. Her father resign property right, property his daughter, I suspect she quite easily handed you." "But say so, Humphrey? Have attached youth?" "Yes, youthful passion, I grant; recollect nothing came it, years passed away. It seven years since quitted forest, letters Mr. Heatherstone made remark upon passed Patience. Since that, never corresponded sent messages; hardly expect girl, age seventeen twenty-four, cherish image one, who, say least, treated her indifference. That view matter, Edward. It may wrong." "And may true," replied Edward, mournfully. "Well, view different," replied Edith. "You know, Humphrey, many offers Patience Heatherstone had, every day, I may say. Why she refused I In opinion, she constant proud brother mine, deserve her!" "It may so, Edith," replied Humphrey. "Women riddles--I argued upon common sense thing." "Much know women," replied Edith. "To sure, meet many New Forest, lived life." "Very true, dear sister; perhaps reason New Forest charms me." "After speech, sir, sooner get back better!" retorted Edith. But Edward made sign Humphrey, beat retreat. "Have seen intendant, Humphrey?" "No; I call upon him, I wanted see first." "I go you. I done justice," replied Edward; "and yet I hardly know explain him." "Say nothing, meet cordially; explanation sufficient." "I shall meet one I shall always revere feel I owe deep debt gratitude. What must he think called upon him!" "Nothing. You hold place court. You may known he London, never met him; coming make appear so. Tell I made known his noble disinterested conduct." "You right--I will. I fear, however, Humphrey, right Edith wrong regards his daughter." "Nay, Edward, recollect I have, Edith observed, passed life woods." Edward kindly received Mr. Heatherstone. Edward, Mr. Heatherstone repeating his intentions relative Arnwood, expressed his sense gentleman's conduct, simply adding-- "You may think impetuous, sir, I trust believe grateful." Patience colored trembled Edward first saw her. Edward refer past time renewed acquaintance. He wooed her again, her. Then explained. About year Restoration, fete Hampton Court, given honor three marriages taking place--Edward Beverley Patience Heatherstone, Chaloner Alice, Grenville Edith; and, his majesty said, he gave away brides, "Could loyalty better rewarded?" But young readers content hear particulars personages appeared little history. Humphrey must take first place. His love farming continued. Edward gave large farm, rent free; years Humphrey saved sufficient purchase property himself. He married Clara Ratcliffe, appeared lately scene, owing her been, two years Restoration, claimed elderly relation, lived country, whose infirm state health permit quit house. He left his property Clara, year her marriage Humphrey. The cottage New Forest held by, eventually made to, Pablo, became steady character, course time married young girl Arnwood, houseful young gipsies. Oswald, soon Edward came Arnwood, gave his place New Forest, lived entirely Edward his steward; Phoebe also went Arnwood, lived good old age, capacity housekeeper, her temper becoming rather worse better she advanced years. This able collect relative several parties; must say farewell. THE END.
