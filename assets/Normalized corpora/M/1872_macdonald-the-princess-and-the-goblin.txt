 THE PRINCESS AND THE GOBLIN CHAPTER 1 Why Princess Has Story About Her There little princess whose father king great country full mountains valleys. His palace built upon one mountains, grand beautiful. The princess, whose name Irene, born there, she sent soon her birth, her mother strong, brought country people large house, half castle, half farmhouse, side another mountain, half-way base peak. The princess sweet little creature, time story begins eight years old, I think, she got older fast. Her face fair pretty, eyes like two bits night sky, star dissolved blue. Those eyes would thought must known came there, often turned direction. The ceiling her nursery blue, stars it, like sky could make it. But I doubt ever she saw real sky stars it, reason I better mention once. These mountains full hollow places underneath; huge caverns, winding ways, water running them, shining colours rainbow light taken in. There would much known them, mines there, great deep pits, long galleries passages running them, dug get ore mountains full. In course digging, miners came upon many natural caverns. A far-off openings side mountain, ravine. Now subterranean caverns lived strange race beings, called gnomes, kobolds, goblins. There legend current country one time lived ground, like people. But reason other, concerning different legendary theories, king laid thought severe taxes upon them, required observances like, begun treat severity, way other, impose stricter laws; consequence disappeared face country. According legend, however, instead going country, taken refuge subterranean caverns, whence never came night, seldom showed numbers, never many people once. It least frequented difficult parts mountains said gather even night open air. Those caught sight said greatly altered course generations; wonder, seeing lived away sun, cold wet dark places. They now, ordinarily ugly, either absolutely hideous, ludicrously grotesque face form. There invention, said, lawless imagination expressed pen pencil, could surpass extravagance appearance. But I suspect said mistaken animal companions goblins themselves--of by. The goblins far removed human description would imply. And grew misshapen body grown knowledge cleverness, able things mortal could see possibility of. But grew cunning, grew mischief, great delight every way could think annoy people lived open-air storey them. They enough affection left preserve absolutely cruel cruelty's sake came way; still heartily cherished ancestral grudge occupied former possessions especially descendants king caused expulsion, sought every opportunity tormenting ways odd inventors; although dwarfed misshapen, strength equal cunning. In process time got king government own, whose chief business, beyond simple affairs, devise trouble neighbours. It pretty evident little princess never seen sky night. They much afraid goblins let her house then, even company ever many attendants; good reason, shall see by. CHAPTER 2 The Princess Loses Herself I said Princess Irene eight years old story begins. And begins. One wet day, mountain covered mist constantly gathering together raindrops, pouring roofs great old house, whence fell fringe water eaves round it, princess could course go out. She got tired, tired even her toys could longer amuse her. You would wonder I time describe one half toys she had. But then, would not toys themselves, makes difference: cannot get tired thing it. It picture, though, worth seeing--the princess sitting nursery sky ceiling her head, great table covered her toys. If artist would like draw this, I advise meddle toys. I afraid attempting describe them, I think he better try draw them. He better not. He thousand things I cannot, I do not think he could draw toys. No man could better make princess herself he could, though--leaning her back bowed back chair, her head hanging down, her hands her lap, miserable she would say herself, even knowing she would like, except go get thoroughly wet, catch particularly nice cold, go bed take gruel. The next moment see her sitting there, her nurse goes room. Even change, princess wakes little, looks her. Then she tumbles her chair runs door, door nurse went of, one opened foot curious old stair worm-eaten oak, looked never anyone set foot upon it. She six steps, sufficient reason, day, trying find top it. Up she ran--such long way seemed her!--until she came top third flight. There she found landing end long passage. Into she ran. It full doors side. There many she care open any, ran end, she turned another passage, also full doors. When she turned twice more, still saw doors doors her, she began get frightened. It silent! And doors must hide rooms nobody them! That dreadful. Also rain made great trampling noise roof. She turned started full speed, her little footsteps echoing sounds rain--back stairs her safe nursery. So she thought, she lost herself long ago. It does not follow she lost, she lost herself, though. She ran distance, turned several times, began afraid. Very soon she sure she lost way back. Rooms everywhere, stair! Her little heart beat fast her little feet ran, lump tears growing her throat. But she eager perhaps frightened cry time. At last her hope failed her. Nothing passages doors everywhere! She threw herself floor, burst wailing cry broken sobs. She cry long, however, she brave could expected princess her age. After good cry, she got up, brushed dust her frock. Oh, old dust was! Then she wiped her eyes her hands, princesses do not always handkerchiefs pockets, little girls I know of. Next, like true princess, she resolved going wisely work find her way back: she would walk passages, look every direction stair. This she did, without success. She went ground without knowing it, passages doors alike. At last, corner, half-open door, she see stair. But alas! went wrong way: instead going down, went up. Frightened she was, however, she could help wishing see yet stair could lead. It narrow, steep she went like four-legged creature her hands feet. CHAPTER 3 The Princess and--We Shall See Who When she came top, she found herself little square place, three doors, two opposite other, one opposite top stair. She stood moment, without idea her little head next. But she stood, she began hear curious humming sound. Could rain? No. It much gentle, even monotonous sound rain, she scarcely heard. The low sweet humming sound went on, sometimes stopping little beginning again. It like hum happy bee found rich well honey globular flower, anything else I think moment. Where could come from? She laid her ear first one doors hearken there--then another. When she laid her ear third door, could doubt came from: must something room. What could be? She rather afraid, her curiosity stronger her fear, she opened door gently peeped in. What think she saw? A old lady sat spinning. Perhaps wonder princess could tell old lady old lady, I inform she beautiful, her skin smooth white. I tell more. Her hair combed back her forehead face, hung loose far her back. That much like old lady--is it? Ah! white almost snow. And although her face smooth, her eyes looked wise could helped seeing she must old. The princess, though she could told why, think her old indeed--quite fifty, she said herself. But she rather older that, shall hear. While princess stared bewildered, her head inside door, old lady lifted hers, said, sweet, old rather shaky voice, mingled pleasantly continued hum her wheel: 'Come in, dear; come in. I glad see you.' That princess real princess might see quite plainly; she did not hang handle door, stare without moving, I known ought princesses rather vulgar little girls. She she told, stepped inside door once, shut gently behind her. 'Come me, dear,' said old lady. And princess she told. She approached old lady--rather slowly, I confess--but stop she stood her side, looked her face her blue eyes two melted stars them. 'Why, eyes, child?' asked old lady. 'Crying,' answered princess. 'Why, child?' 'Because I could not find way again.' 'But could find way up.' 'Not first--not long time.' 'But face streaked like back zebra. Had not handkerchief wipe eyes with?' 'No.' 'Then did not come wipe you?' 'Please, I did not know here. I next time.' 'There is good child!' said old lady. Then she stopped her wheel, rose, and, going room, returned little silver basin soft white towel, she washed wiped bright little face. And princess thought her hands smooth nice! When she carried away basin towel, little princess wondered see straight tall she was, for, although she old, she did not stoop bit. She dressed black velvet thick white heavy-looking lace it; black dress her hair shone like silver. There hardly furniture room might poorest old woman made her bread her spinning. There carpet floor--no table anywhere--nothing spinning-wheel chair beside it. When she came back, she sat without word began her spinning more, Irene, never seen spinning-wheel, stood her side looked on. When old lady got her thread fairly going again, she said princess, without looking her: 'Do know name, child?' 'No, I do not know it,' answered princess. 'My name Irene.' 'That is name!' cried princess. 'I know that. I let mine. I have not got name. You have got mine.' 'How be?' asked princess, bewildered. 'I have always name.' 'Your papa, king, asked I objection it; and, course, I had not. I let pleasure.' 'It kind give name--and pretty one,' said princess. 'Oh, kind!' said old lady. 'A name one things one give away keep same. I good many things. Would not like know I am, child?' 'Yes, I should--very much.' 'I am great-great-grandmother,' said lady. 'What is that?' asked princess. 'I am father's mother's father's mother.' 'Oh, dear! I cannot understand that,' said princess. 'I dare say not. I did not expect would. But that is reason I should not say it.' 'Oh, no!' answered princess. 'I explain older,' lady went on. 'But able understand much now: I came take care you.' 'Is long since came? Was yesterday? Or today, wet I could not get out?' 'I have ever since came yourself.' 'What long time!' said princess. 'I do not remember all.' 'No. I suppose not.' 'But I never saw before.' 'No. But shall see again.' 'Do live room always?' 'I do not sleep it. I sleep opposite side landing. I sit day.' 'I should not like it. My nursery much prettier. You must queen too, great big grand-mother.' 'Yes, I queen.' 'Where crown, then?' 'In bedroom.' 'I like see it.' 'You shall day--not today.' 'I wonder nursie never told me.' 'Nursie does not know. She never saw me.' 'But somebody knows house?' 'No; nobody.' 'How get dinner, then?' 'I keep poultry--of sort.' 'Where keep them?' 'I show you.' 'And makes chicken broth you?' 'I never kill MY chickens.' 'Then I cannot understand.' 'What breakfast morning?' asked lady. 'Oh! I bread milk, egg--I dare say eat eggs.' 'Yes, that is it. I eat eggs.' 'Is makes hair white?' 'No, dear. It is old age. I old.' 'I thought so. Are fifty?' 'Yes--more that.' 'Are hundred?' 'Yes--more that. I old guess. Come see chickens.' Again she stopped her spinning. She rose, took princess hand, led her room, opened door opposite stair. The princess expected see lot hens chickens, instead that, she saw blue sky first, roofs house, multitude loveliest pigeons, mostly white, colours, walking about, making bows other, talking language she could understand. She clapped her hands delight, rose flapping wings she her turn startled. 'You have frightened poultry,' said old lady, smiling. 'And they have frightened me,' said princess, smiling too. 'But nice poultry! Are eggs nice?' 'Yes, nice.' 'What small egg-spoon must have! Would not better keep hens, get bigger eggs?' 'How I feed them, though?' 'I see,' said princess. 'The pigeons feed themselves. They have got wings.' 'Just so. If could not fly, I could not eat eggs.' 'But get eggs? Where nests?' The lady took hold little loop string wall side door and, lifting shutter, showed great many pigeon-holes nests, young ones eggs them. The birds came side, she took eggs side. She closed quickly, lest young ones frightened. 'Oh, nice way!' cried princess. 'Will give egg eat? I am rather hungry.' 'I day, must go back, nursie miserable you. I dare say she is looking everywhere.' 'Except here,' answered princess. 'Oh, surprised she I tell her great big grand-grand-mother!' 'Yes, she will!' said old lady curious smile. 'Mind tell her exactly.' 'That I will. Please take back her?' 'I cannot go way, I take top stair, must run quite fast room.' The little princess put her hand old lady's, who, looking way that, brought her top first stair, thence bottom second, leave her till she saw her half-way third. When she heard cry her nurse's pleasure finding her, she turned walked stairs again, fast indeed great grandmother, sat her spinning another strange smile her sweet old face. About spinning I tell another time. Guess she spinning. CHAPTER 4 What Nurse Thought It 'Why, been, princess?' asked nurse, taking her her arms. 'It is unkind hide away long. I began afraid--' Here she checked herself. 'What afraid of, nursie?' asked princess. 'Never mind,' she answered. 'Perhaps I tell another day. Now tell been.' 'I have long way see great, huge, old grandmother,' said princess. 'What mean that?' asked nurse, thought she making fun. 'I mean I have long way see My GREAT grandmother. Ah, nursie, do not know beautiful mother grandmothers I have got upstairs. She old lady, lovely white hair--as white silver cup. Now, I think it, I think her hair must silver.' 'What nonsense talking, princess!' said nurse. 'I am talking nonsense,' returned Irene, rather offended. 'I tell her. She is much taller you, much prettier.' 'Oh, I dare say!' remarked nurse. 'And she lives upon pigeons' eggs.' 'Most likely,' said nurse. 'And she sits empty room, spin-spinning day long.' 'Not doubt it,' said nurse. 'And she keeps her crown her bedroom.' 'Of course--quite proper place keep her crown in. She wears bed, I will bound.' 'She did not say that. And I do not think she does. That would not comfortable--would it? I do not think papa wears his crown night-cap. Does he, nursie?' 'I never asked him. I dare say he does.' 'And she is ever since I came here--ever many years.' 'Anybody could told that,' said nurse, believe word Irene saying. 'Why did not tell me, then?' 'There necessity. You could make yourself.' 'You do not believe me, then!' exclaimed princess, astonished angry, she well might be. 'Did expect believe you, princess?' asked nurse coldly. 'I know princesses habit telling make-believes, first I ever heard expected believed,' she added, seeing child strangely earnest. The princess burst tears. 'Well, I must say,' remarked nurse, thoroughly vexed her crying, 'it becoming princess tell stories expect believed she princess.' 'But it is quite true, I tell you.' 'You have dreamt it, then, child.' 'No, I did not dream it. I went upstairs, I lost myself, I had not found beautiful lady, I never found myself.' 'Oh, I dare say!' 'Well, come me, see I am telling truth.' 'Indeed I work do. It is dinnertime, I will not nonsense.' The princess wiped her eyes, her face grew hot soon quite dry. She sat her dinner, ate next nothing. Not believed agree princesses: real princess cannot tell lie. So afternoon she speak word. Only nurse spoke her, she answered her, real princess never rude--even she well offended. Of course nurse comfortable her mind--not she suspected least truth Irene's story, she loved her dearly, vexed herself cross her. She thought her crossness princess's unhappiness, idea she really deeply hurt believed. But, became plain evening her every motion look, that, although she tried amuse herself her toys, her heart vexed troubled enjoy them, her nurse's discomfort grew grew. When bedtime came, she undressed laid her down, child, instead holding her little mouth kissed, turned away her lay still. Then nursie's heart gave way altogether, she began cry. At sound her first sob princess turned again, held her face kiss her usual. But nurse her handkerchief her eyes, see movement. 'Nursie,' said princess, 'why will not believe me?' 'Because I cannot believe you,' said nurse, getting angry again. 'Ah! then, cannot help it,' said Irene, 'and I vexed more. I give kiss go sleep.' 'You little angel!' cried nurse, caught her bed, walked room her her arms, kissing hugging her. 'You let take see dear old great big grandmother, will not you?' said princess, she laid her again. 'And will not say I am ugly, more--will you, princess?' 'Nursie, I never said ugly. What mean?' 'Well, did not say it, meant it.' 'Indeed, I never did.' 'You said I was not pretty that--' 'As beautiful grandmother--yes, I say that; I say again, it is quite true.' 'Then I think unkind!' said nurse, put her handkerchief her eyes again. 'Nursie, dear, everybody cannot beautiful every body, know. You nice-looking, beautiful grandmother--' 'Bother grandmother!' said nurse. 'Nurse, that is rude. You fit spoken till behave better.' The princess turned away more, nurse ashamed herself. 'I am sure I beg pardon, princess,' she said, though still offended tone. But princess let tone pass, heeded words. 'You will not say again, I sure,' she answered, turning towards her nurse. 'I going say twice nice-looking are, king would married you, would become me?' 'You angel!' repeated nurse, embracing her. 'Now,' insisted Irene, 'you come see grandmother--will not you?' 'I go anywhere like, cherub,' she answered; two minutes weary little princess fast asleep. CHAPTER 5 The Princess Let Us Well Alone When she woke next morning, first thing she heard rain still falling. Indeed, day like last would difficult tell use It. The first thing she thought of, however, rain, lady tower; first question occupied her thoughts whether she ask nurse fulfil her promise morning, go her find her grandmother soon she her breakfast. But she came conclusion perhaps lady would pleased she took anyone see her without first asking leave; especially pretty evident, seeing she lived pigeons' eggs, cooked herself, she want household know she there. So princess resolved take first opportunity running alone asking whether she might bring her nurse. She believed fact she could otherwise convince her she telling truth would much weight her grandmother. The princess her nurse best friends dressing-time, princess consequence ate enormous little breakfast. 'I wonder, Lootie'--that her pet name her nurse--'what pigeons' eggs taste like?' she said, she eating her egg--not quite common one, always picked pinky ones her. 'We will get pigeon's egg, shall judge yourself,' said nurse. 'Oh, no, no!' returned Irene, suddenly reflecting might disturb old lady getting it, even not, she would one less consequence. 'What strange creature are,' said nurse--'first want thing refuse it!' But she say crossly, princess never minded remarks unfriendly. 'Well, see, Lootie, reasons,' she returned, said more, she want bring subject former strife, lest her nurse offer go she her grandmother's permission bring her. Of course she could refuse take her, she would believe her less ever. Now nurse, she said herself afterwards, could every moment room; never yesterday princess given her smallest reason anxiety, yet come her head watch her closely. So she soon gave her chance, and, first offered, Irene stairs again. This day's adventure, however, turn like yesterday's, although began like it; indeed to-day seldom like yesterday, people would note differences--even rains. The princess ran passage passage, could find stair tower. My suspicion she gone high enough, searching second instead third floor. When she turned go back, she failed equally her search stair. She lost more. Something made even worse bear time, wonder she cried again. Suddenly occurred her cried she found her grandmother's stair. She got once, wiped her eyes, started upon fresh quest. This time, although she find she hoped, she found next best: she come stair went up, she came upon one went down. It evidently stair she come up, yet good deal better none; she went, singing merrily she reached bottom. There, her surprise, she found herself kitchen. Although she allowed go alone, her nurse often taken her, she great favourite servants. So general rush her moment she appeared, every one wanted her; report she soon reached nurse's ears. She came fetch her; she never suspected she got there, princess kept her counsel. Her failure find old lady disappointed her, made her thoughtful. Sometimes she came almost nurse's opinion she dreamed her; fancy never lasted long. She wondered much whether she ever see her again, thought sad able find her she particularly wanted her. She resolved say nothing her nurse subject, seeing little her power prove her words. CHAPTER 6 The Little Miner The next day great cloud still hung mountain, rain poured like water full sponge. The princess fond doors, she nearly cried she saw weather better. But mist dark dingy grey; light it; hours went grew brighter brighter, almost brilliant look at; late afternoon sun broke gloriously Irene clapped her hands, crying: 'See, see, Lootie! The sun his face washed. Look bright he is! Do get hat, let us go walk. Oh, dear! oh, dear! happy I am!' Lootie glad please princess. She got her hat cloak, set together walk mountain; road hard steep water could rest upon it, always dry enough walking minutes rain ceased. The clouds rolling away broken pieces, like great, overwoolly sheep, whose wool sun bleached till almost white eyes bear. Between sky shone deeper purer blue, rain. The trees roadside hung drops, sparkled sun like jewels. The things brighter rain brooks ran mountain; changed clearness crystal muddy brown; lost colour gained sound--or least noise, brook swollen musical before. But Irene raptures great brown streams tumbling everywhere; Lootie shared her delight, she confined house three days. At length she observed sun getting low, said time going back. She made remark again, but, every time, princess begged her go little farther little farther; reminding her much easier go downhill, saying turn would home moment. So go, look group ferns whose tops stream pouring watery arch, pick shining stone rock wayside, watch flight bird. Suddenly shadow great mountain peak came behind, shot front them. When nurse saw it, she started shook, catching hold princess's hand turned began run hill. 'What is haste, nursie?' asked Irene, running alongside her. 'We must moment longer.' 'But cannot help good many moments longer.' It true. The nurse almost cried. They much far home. It express orders princess one moment sun down; nearly mile mountain! If His Majesty, Irene's papa, hear it, Lootie would certainly dismissed; leave princess would break her heart. It wonder she ran. But Irene least frightened, knowing anything frightened at. She kept chattering well she could, easy. 'Lootie! Lootie! run fast? It shakes teeth I talk.' 'Then do not talk,' said Lootie. 'But princess went talking. She always saying: 'Look, look, Lootie!' Lootie paid heed anything she said, ran on. 'Look, look, Lootie! Do not see funny man peeping rock?' Lootie ran faster. They pass rock, came nearer, princess saw lump rock she taken man. 'Look, look, Lootie! There is curious creature foot old tree. Look it, Lootie! It is making faces us, I think.' Lootie gave stifled cry, ran faster still--so fast Irene's little legs could keep her, she fell crash. It hard downhill road, she running fast--so wonder she began cry. This put nurse nearly beside herself; she could run on, moment she got princess her feet again. 'Who is laughing me?' said princess, trying keep her sobs, running fast her grazed knees. 'Nobody, child,' said nurse, almost angrily. But instant came burst coarse tittering somewhere near, hoarse indistinct voice seemed say: 'Lies! lies! lies!' 'Oh!' cried nurse sigh almost scream, ran faster ever. 'Nursie! Lootie! I cannot run more. Do let us walk bit.' 'What I do?' said nurse. 'Here, I carry you.' She caught her up; found her much heavy run with, set her again. Then she looked wildly her, gave great cry, said: 'We have taken wrong turning somewhere, I do not know are. We lost, lost!' The terror she quite bewildered her. It true enough lost way. They running little valley house seen. Now Irene know good reason her nurse's terror, servants strict orders never mention goblins her, discomposing see her nurse fright. Before, however, she time grow thoroughly alarmed like her, she heard sound whistling, revived her. Presently she saw boy coming road valley meet them. He whistler; met his whistling changed singing. And something like he sang: 'Ring! dod! bang! Go hammers' clang! Hit turn bore! Whizz puff roar! Thus rive rocks, Force goblin locks.-- See shining ore! One, two, three-- Bright gold be! Four, five, six-- Shovels, mattocks, picks! Seven, eight, nine-- Light lamp mine. Ten, eleven, twelve-- Loosely hold helve. We are merry miner-boys, Make goblins hold noise.' 'I wish YOU would hold noise,' said nurse rudely, word GOBLIN time place made her tremble. It would bring goblins upon certainty, she thought, defy way. But whether boy heard her not, he stop his singing. 'Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen-- This worth siftin'; Sixteen, seventeen, eighteen-- There is match, lay't in. Nineteen, twenty-- Goblins plenty.' 'Do quiet,' cried nurse, whispered shriek. But boy, close hand, still went on. 'Hush! scush! scurry! There go hurry! Gobble! gobble! goblin! There go wobblin'; Hobble, hobble, hobblin'-- Cobble! cobble! cobblin'! Hob-bob-goblin!-- Huuuuuh!' 'There!' said boy, he stood still opposite them. 'There! that will them. They cannot bear singing, cannot stand song. They cannot sing themselves, voice crow; do not like people sing.' The boy dressed miner's dress, curious cap his head. He nice-looking boy, eyes dark mines he worked sparkling crystals rocks. He twelve years old. His face almost pale beauty, came his little open air sunlight--for even vegetables grown dark white; he looked happy, merry indeed--perhaps thought routed goblins; his bearing he stood nothing clownish rude it. 'I saw them,' he went on, 'as I came up; I am glad I did. I knew somebody, I could not see was. They will not touch long I am you.' 'Why, you?' asked nurse, offended freedom he spoke them. 'I am Peter's son.' 'Who is Peter?' 'Peter miner.' 'I do not know him.' 'I am his son, though.' 'And goblins mind you, pray?' 'Because I do not mind them. I am used them.' 'What difference make?' 'If you are afraid them, they are afraid you. I am afraid them. That is all. But it is that is wanted--up here, is. It is different thing there. They will not always mind song even, there. And anyone sings it, stand grinning awfully; he gets frightened, misses word, says wrong one, they--oh! do not give him!' 'What him?' asked Irene, trembling voice. 'Do not go frightening princess,' said nurse. 'The princess!' repeated little miner, taking his curious cap. 'I beg pardon; ought not late. Everybody knows that is law.' 'Yes, indeed is!' said nurse, beginning cry again. 'And I shall suffer it.' 'What matter?' said boy. 'It must fault. It princess suffer it. I hope did not hear call her princess. If did, they are sure know her again: they are awfully sharp.' 'Lootie! Lootie!' cried princess. 'Take home.' 'Do not go like that,' said nurse boy, almost fiercely. 'How could I help it? I lost way.' 'You should not late. You would not lost way had not frightened,' said boy. 'Come along. I will soon set right again. Shall I carry little Highness?' 'Impertinence!' murmured nurse, she say aloud, she thought she made angry he might take his revenge telling someone belonging house, would sure come king's ears. 'No, thank you,' said Irene. 'I walk well, though I cannot run fast nursie. If give one hand, Lootie give another, I shall get famously.' They soon her them, holding hand each. 'Now let us run,' said nurse. 'No, no!' said little miner. 'That is worst thing do. If had not run before, would lost way. And run now, moment.' 'I do not want run,' said Irene. 'You do not think me,' said nurse. 'Yes, I do, Lootie. The boy says will not touch us do not run.' 'Yes, know house I have kept late I shall turned away, would break heart.' 'Turned away, Lootie! Who would turn away?' 'Your papa, child.' 'But I will tell fault. And know was, Lootie.' 'He will not mind that. I am sure he will not.' 'Then I will cry, go knees him, beg take away dear Lootie.' The nurse comforted hearing this, said more. They went on, walking pretty fast, taking care run step. 'I want talk you,' said Irene little miner; 'but it is awkward! I do not know name.' 'My name's Curdie, little princess.' 'What funny name! Curdie! What more?' 'Curdie Peterson. What is name, please?' 'Irene.' 'What more?' 'I do not know more. What name, Lootie?' 'Princesses have not got one name. They do not want it.' 'Oh, then, Curdie, must call Irene more.' 'No, indeed,' said nurse indignantly. 'He shall thing.' 'What shall he call me, then, Lootie?' 'Your Royal Highness.' 'My Royal Highness! What is that? No, no, Lootie. I will not called names. I do not like them. You told it is rude children call names; I am sure Curdie would not rude. Curdie, name's Irene.' 'Well, Irene,' said Curdie, glance nurse showed he enjoyed teasing her; 'it kind let call anything. I like name much.' He expected nurse interfere again; he soon saw she frightened speak. She staring something yards middle path, narrowed rocks one could pass time. 'It much kinder go way take us home,' said Irene. 'I am going way yet,' said Curdie. 'It is side rocks path turns father's.' 'You would not think leaving us till we are safe home, I am sure,' gasped nurse. 'Of course not,' said Curdie. 'You dear, good, kind Curdie! I will give kiss get home,' said princess. The nurse gave her great pull hand she held. But instant something middle way, looked like great lump earth brought rain, began move. One another shot four long things, like two arms two legs, dark tell were. The nurse began tremble head foot. Irene clasped Curdie's hand yet faster, Curdie began sing again: 'One, two-- Hit hew! Three, four-- Blast bore! Five, six-- There is fix! Seven, eight-- Hold straight! Nine, ten-- Hit again! Hurry! scurry! Bother! smother! There is toad In road! Smash it! Squash it! Fry it! Dry it! You are another! Up off! There is enough!-- Huuuuuh!' As he uttered last words, Curdie let go his hold his companion, rushed thing road he would trample his feet. It gave great spring, ran straight one rocks like huge spider. Curdie turned back laughing, took Irene's hand again. She grasped his tight, said nothing till passed rocks. A yards she found herself part road she knew, able speak again. 'Do know, Curdie, I do not quite like song: sounds rather rude,' she said. 'Well, perhaps is,' answered Curdie. 'I never thought that; it is way have. We do not like it.' 'Who do not like it?' 'The cobs, call them.' 'Do not!' said nurse. 'Why not?' said Curdie. 'I beg will not. Please do not.' 'Oh! ask way, course, I will not; though I do not bit know why. Look! lights great house below. You will home five minutes now.' Nothing happened. They reached home safety. Nobody missed them, even known gone out; arrived door belonging part house without anyone seeing them. The nurse rushing hurried over-gracious good night Curdie; princess pulled her hand hers, throwing her arms round Curdie's neck, she caught her dragged her away. 'Lootie! Lootie! I promised kiss,' cried Irene. 'A princess must not give kisses. It is proper,' said Lootie. 'But I promised,' said princess. 'There is occasion; he is miner-boy.' 'He is good boy, brave boy, he kind us. Lootie! Lootie! I promised.' 'Then should not promised.' 'Lootie, I promised kiss.' 'Your Royal Highness,' said Lootie, suddenly grown respectful, 'must come directly.' 'Nurse, princess must break her word,' said Irene, drawing herself standing stock-still. Lootie know king might count worst--to let princess sunset, let her kiss miner-boy. She know that, gentleman, many kings been, he would counted neither worse. However much he might disliked his daughter kiss miner-boy, he would her break her word goblins creation. But, I say, nurse lady enough understand this, she great difficulty, for, she insisted, someone might hear princess cry run see, would come out. But Curdie came rescue. 'Never mind, Princess Irene,' he said. 'You must not kiss tonight. But shall not break word. I come another time. You may sure I will.' 'Oh, thank you, Curdie!' said princess, stopped crying. 'Good night, Irene; good night, Lootie,' said Curdie, turned sight moment. 'I like see him!' muttered nurse, she carried princess nursery. 'You see him,' said Irene. 'You may sure Curdie keep his word. He is sure come again.' 'I like see him!' repeated nurse, said more. She want open new strife princess saying plainly she meant. Glad enough she succeeded getting home unseen, keeping princess kissing miner's boy, she resolved watch her far better future. Her carelessness already doubled danger she in. Formerly goblins her fear; she protect her charge Curdie well. CHAPTER 7 The Mines Curdie went home whistling. He resolved say nothing princess fear getting nurse trouble, he enjoyed teasing her her absurdity, he careful her harm. He saw goblins, soon fast asleep his bed. He woke middle night, thought he heard curious noises outside. He sat listened; got up, and, opening door quietly, went out. When he peeped round corner, he saw, his window, group stumpy creatures, he recognized shape. Hardly, however, he begun his 'One, two, three!' broke asunder, scurried away, sight. He returned laughing, got bed again, fast asleep moment. Reflecting little matter morning, he came conclusion that, nothing kind ever happened before, must annoyed interfering protect princess. By time he dressed, however, he thinking something quite different, he value enmity goblins least. As soon breakfast, he set his father mine. They entered hill natural opening huge rock, little stream rushed out. They followed course yards, passage took turn, sloped steeply heart hill. With many angles windings branchings-off, sometimes steps came upon natural gulf, led deep hill arrived place present digging precious ore. This various kinds, mountain rich better sorts metals. With flint steel, tinder-box, lighted lamps, fixed heads, soon hard work pickaxes shovels hammers. Father son work near other, gang--the passages ore dug, called gangs--for lode, vein ore, small, one miner would dig away alone passage bigger gave room work--sometimes uncomfortable cramped positions. If stopped moment could hear everywhere around them, nearer, farther off, sounds companions burrowing away directions inside great mountain--some boring holes rock order blow gunpowder, others shovelling broken ore baskets carried mouth mine, others hitting away pickaxes. Sometimes, miner lonely part, he would hear tap-tapping, louder woodpecker, sound would come great distance solid mountain rock. The work hard best, warm underground; particularly unpleasant, miners, wanted earn little money particular purpose, would stop behind rest work night. But could tell night day there, except feeling tired sleepy; light sun ever came gloomy regions. Some thus remained behind night, although certain none companions work, would declare next morning heard, every time halted moment take breath, tap-tapping them, mountain full miners ever day; consequence would never stay overnight, knew sounds goblins. They worked night, miners' night goblins' day. Indeed, greater number miners afraid goblins; strange stories well known amongst treatment received goblins surprised work night. The courageous them, however, amongst Peter Peterson Curdie, took his father, stayed mine night again, although several times encountered stray goblins, never yet failed driving away. As I indicated already, chief defence verse, hated verse every kind, kinds could endure all. I suspect could make themselves, disliked much. At events, afraid could neither make verses remember verses people made them; never afraid could make verses themselves; although certain old rhymes effectual, yet well known new rhyme, right sort, even distasteful them, therefore effectual putting flight. Perhaps readers may wondering goblins could about, working night long, seeing never carried ore sold it; I informed concerning Curdie learned next night, able understand. For Curdie determined, his father would permit him, remain alone night--and two reasons: first, he wanted get extra wages he might buy warm red petticoat his mother, begun complain cold mountain air sooner usual autumn; second, he faint hope finding goblins his window night before. When he told his father, he made objection, he great confidence his boy's courage resources. 'I am sorry I cannot stay you,' said Peter; 'but I want go pay parson visit evening, besides I have bit headache day.' 'I am sorry that, father,' said Curdie. 'Oh, it is much. You will sure take care yourself, will not you?' 'Yes, father; I will. I will keep sharp look-out, I promise you.' Curdie one remained mine. About six of the clock rest went away, everyone bidding good night, telling take care himself; he great favourite all. 'Do not forget rhymes,' said one. 'No, no,'answered Curdie. 'It is matter he does,' said another, 'for he will make new one.' 'Yes: he might not able make fast enough,' said another; 'and cooking his head, might take mean advantage set upon him.' 'I will best,' said Curdie. 'I am afraid.' 'We know that,' returned, left him. CHAPTER 8 The Goblins For time Curdie worked away briskly, throwing ore he disengaged one side behind him, ready carrying morning. He heard good deal goblin-tapping, sounded far away hill, he paid little heed. Towards midnight he began feel rather hungry; he dropped his pickaxe, got lump bread morning he laid damp hole rock, sat heap ore, ate his supper. Then he leaned back five minutes' rest beginning his work again, laid his head rock. He kept position one minute he heard something made sharpen his ears. It sounded like voice inside rock. After he heard again. It goblin voice--there could doubt that--and time he could make words. 'Had not better moving?'it said. A rougher deeper voice replied: 'There is hurry. That wretched little mole will not tonight, he work ever hard. He is means thinnest place.' 'But still think lode come house?' said first voice. 'Yes, good bit farther he got yet. If he struck stroke side here,' said goblin, tapping stone, seemed Curdie, his head lay, 'he would through; he is couple yards past now, he follow lode week leads in. You see back there--a long way. Still, perhaps, case accident would well getting this. Helfer, you will take great chest. That is business, know.' 'Yes, dad,' said third voice. 'But must help get back. It is awfully heavy, know.' 'Well, is not bag smoke, I admit. But you are strong mountain, Helfer.' 'You say so, dad. I think I am right. But I could carry ten times much was not feet.' 'That weak point, I confess, boy.' 'Are not too, father?' 'Well, honest, it is goblin weakness. Why come soft, I declare I have not idea.' 'Specially head's hard, know, father.' 'Yes boy. The goblin's glory his head. To think fellows put helmets things go fighting! Ha! ha!' 'But do not wear shoes like them, father? I like it--especially I have got chest like head.' 'Well, see, it is fashion. The king never wears shoes.' 'The queen does.' 'Yes; that is distinction. The first queen, see--I mean king's first wife--wore shoes, course, she came upstairs; so, she died, next queen would inferior her she called it, would wear shoes too. It pride. She hardest forbidding rest women.' 'I am sure I would not wear them--no, for--that I would not!' said first voice, evidently mother family. 'I cannot think either should.' 'Did not I tell first upstairs?' said other. 'That silly thing I ever knew His Majesty guilty of. Why he marry outlandish woman like that-one natural enemies too?' 'I suppose he fell love her.' 'Pooh! pooh! He is happy one his people.' 'Did she die soon? They did not tease her death, they?' 'Oh, dear, no! The king worshipped her footmarks.' 'What made her die, then? Did not air agree her?' 'She died young prince born.' 'How silly her! We never that. It must she wore shoes.' 'I do not know that.' 'Why wear shoes there?' 'Ah, that is sensible question, I answer it. But order so, I must first tell secret. I saw queen's feet.' 'Without her shoes?' 'Yes--without her shoes.' 'No! Did you? How it?' 'Never mind was. She did not know I saw them. And think!--they toes!' 'Toes! What is that?' 'You may well ask! I never known I seen queen's feet. Just imagine! ends her feet split five six thin pieces!' 'Oh, horrid! How could king fallen love her?' 'You forget she wore shoes. That she wore them. That men, women too, upstairs wear shoes. They cannot bear sight feet without them.' 'Ah! I understand. If ever wish shoes again, Helfer, I will hit feet--I will.' 'No, no, mother; pray do not.' 'Then do not you.' 'But big box head--' A horrid scream followed, Curdie interpreted reply blow his mother upon feet her eldest goblin. 'Well, I never knew much before!' remarked fourth voice. 'Your knowledge universal quite yet,' said father. 'You fifty last month. Mind see bed bedding. As soon we have finished supper, we will going. Ha! ha! ha!' 'What laughing at, husband?' 'I am laughing think mess miners find in--somewhere day ten years.' 'Why, mean?' 'Oh, nothing.' 'Oh, yes, mean something. You always mean something.' 'It is do, then, wife.' 'That may be; it is I find out, know.' 'Ha! ha! You are sharp one. What mother you have got, Helfer!' 'Yes, father.' 'Well, I suppose I must tell you. They are palace consulting tonight; soon we have got away thin place I am going hear night fix upon. I like see young ruffian side, struggling agonies of--' He dropped his voice low Curdie could hear growl. The growl went low bass good while, inarticulate goblin's tongue sausage; his wife spoke rose former pitch. 'But shall palace?' she asked. 'I see safe new house I have digging last two months. Podge, mind table chairs. I commit care. The table seven legs--each chair three. I shall require hands.' After arose confused conversation various household goods transport; Curdie heard nothing importance. He knew least one reasons constant sound goblin hammers pickaxes night. They making new houses themselves, might retreat miners threaten break dwellings. But he learned two things far greater importance. The first was, grievous calamity preparing, almost ready fall upon heads miners; second was--the one weak point goblin's body; he known feet tender he reason suspect. He heard said toes: he never opportunity inspecting closely enough, dusk always appeared, satisfy whether correct report. Indeed, he able even satisfy whether fingers, although also commonly said fact. One miners, indeed, schooling rest, will not argue must primordial condition humanity, education handicraft developed toes fingers--with proposition Curdie heard his father sarcastically agree, alleging support probability babies' gloves traditional remnant old state things; stockings ages, regard paid toes, pointed direction. But importance fact concerning softness goblin feet, he foresaw might useful miners. What he meantime, however, discover, possible, special evil design goblins heads. Although he knew gangs natural galleries communicated mined part mountain, he least idea palace king gnomes was; otherwise he would set enterprise discovering said design was. He judged, rightly, must lie farther part mountain, mine yet communication. There must one nearly completed, however; could thin partition separated them. If he could get time follow goblins retreated! A blows would doubtless sufficient--just his ear lay; he attempted strike his pickaxe, he would hasten departure family, put guard, perhaps lose involuntary guidance. He therefore began feel wall With his hands, soon found stones loose enough drawn little noise. Laying hold large one his hands, he drew gently out, let softly. 'What noise?' said goblin father. Curdie blew his light, lest shine through. 'It must one miner stayed behind rest,' said mother. 'No; he is gone good while. I have not heard blow hour. Besides, was not like that.' 'Then I suppose must stone carried brook inside.' 'Perhaps. It room by.' Curdie kept quite still. After little while, hearing nothing sounds preparations departure, mingled occasional word direction, anxious know whether removal stone made opening goblins' house, he put his hand feel. It went good way, came contact something soft. He moment feel over, quickly withdrawn: one toeless goblin feet. The owner gave cry fright. 'What is matter, Helfer?' asked his mother. 'A beast came wall licked foot.' 'Nonsense! There wild beasts country,' said his father. 'But was, father. I felt it.' 'Nonsense, I say. Will malign native realms reduce level country upstairs? That swarming wild beasts every description.' 'But I feel it, father.' 'I tell hold tongue. You patriot.' Curdie suppressed his laughter, lay still mouse--but stiller, every moment he kept nibbling away his fingers edges hole. He slowly making bigger, rock much shattered blasting. There seemed good many family, judge mass confused talk came hole; speaking together, bottle-brushes--each least one--in throats, easy make much said. At length he heard father goblin saying. 'Now, then,' he said, 'get bundles backs. Here, Helfer, I will help chest.' 'I wish chest, father.' 'Your turn come good time enough! Make haste. I must go meeting palace tonight. When that is over, come back clear last things enemies return morning. Now light torches, come along. What distinction is, provide light, instead dependent thing hung air--a disagreeable contrivance--intended doubt blind us venture baleful influence! Quite glaring vulgar, I call it, though doubt useful poor creatures have not wit make light themselves.' Curdie could hardly keep calling know whether made fire light torches by. But moment's reflection showed would said did, inasmuch struck two stones together, fire came. CHAPTER 9 The Hall Goblin Palace A sound many soft feet followed, soon ceased. Then Curdie flew hole like tiger, tore pulled. The sides gave way, soon large enough crawl through. He would betray rekindling his lamp, torches retreating company, he found departing straight line long avenue door cave, threw back light enough afford glance round deserted home goblins. To his surprise, he could discover nothing distinguish ordinary natural cave rock, upon many he come rest miners progress excavations. The goblins talked coming back rest household gear: he saw nothing would made suspect family taken shelter single night. The floor rough stony; walls full projecting corners; roof one place twenty feet high, another endangering his forehead; one side stream, thicker needle, true, still sufficient spread wide dampness wall, flowed face rock. But troop front toiling heavy burdens. He could distinguish Helfer then, flickering light shade, his heavy chest his bending shoulders; second brother almost buried looked like great feather bed. 'Where get feathers?' thought Curdie; moment troop disappeared turn way, safe necessary Curdie follow them, lest round next turning he saw again, he might lose altogether. He darted like greyhound. When he reached corner looked cautiously round, he saw distance another long passage. None galleries he saw night bore signs work man--or goblin either. Stalactites, far older mines, hung roofs; floors rough boulders large round stones, showing water must run. He waited corner till disappeared round next, followed long way one passage another. The passages grew lofty, covered roof shining stalactites. It strange enough procession he followed. But strangest part household animals crowded amongst feet goblins. It true wild animals there--at least know any; wonderful number tame ones. I must, however, reserve contributions towards natural history later position story. At length, turning corner abruptly, he almost rushed middle goblin family; already set burdens floor cave considerably larger left. They yet breathless speak, else he would warning arrest. He started back, however, anyone saw him, retreating good way, stood watching till father come go palace. Before long, he his son Helfer appeared kept direction before, Curdie followed renewed precaution. For long time he heard sound except something like rush river inside rock; length seemed far-off noise great shouting reached his ears, which, however, presently ceased. After advancing good way farther, he thought he heard single voice. It sounded clearer clearer he went on, last he could almost distinguish words. In moment two, keeping goblins round another corner, he started back--this time amazement. He entrance magnificent cavern, oval shape, probably huge natural reservoir water, great palace hall goblins. It rose tremendous height, roof composed shining materials, multitude torches carried goblins crowded floor lighted place brilliantly, Curdie could see top quite well. But he idea immense place his eyes got accustomed it, good many minutes. The rough projections walls, shadows thrown upwards torches, made sides chamber look crowded statues upon brackets pedestals, reaching irregular tiers floor roof. The walls were, many parts, gloriously shining substances, gorgeously coloured besides, powerfully contrasted shadows. Curdie could help wondering whether his rhymes would use multitude goblins filled floor hall, indeed felt considerably tempted begin his shout 'One, two, three!', reason routing much endeavouring discover designs, he kept perfectly quiet, peering round edge doorway, listened his sharp ears. At end hall, high heads multitude, terrace-like ledge considerable height, caused receding upper part cavern-wall. Upon sat king his court: king throne hollowed huge block green copper ore, his court upon lower seats around it. The king making speech, applause followed Curdie heard. One court addressing multitude. What he heard say following effect: 'Hence appears two plans time together working strong head His Majesty deliverance his people. Regardless fact first possessors regions inhabit; regardless equally fact abandoned region loftiest motives; regardless also self-evident fact excel far mental ability excel us stature, look upon us degraded race make mockery finer feelings. But, time almost arrived when--thanks His Majesty's inventive genius--it power take thorough revenge upon all, respect unfriendly behaviour.' 'May please Your Majesty--' cried voice close door, Curdie recognized goblin he followed. 'Who he interrupts Chancellor?' cried another near throne. 'Glump,' answered several voices. 'He trusty subject,' said king himself, slow stately voice: 'let come forward speak.' A lane parted crowd, Glump, ascended platform bowed king, spoke follows: 'Sire, I would held peace, I known I knew near moment, Chancellor referred. In probability, another day past, enemy broken house--the partition even foot thickness.' 'Not quite much,' thought Curdie himself. 'This evening I remove household effects; therefore sooner ready carry plan, execution His Majesty making magnificent preparations, better. I may add, within last days I perceived small outbreak dining-room, which, combined observations upon course river escaping evil men enter, convinced close spot must deep gulf channel. This discovery will, I trust, add considerably otherwise immense forces His Majesty's disposal.' He ceased, king graciously acknowledged his speech bend his head; whereupon Glump, bow His Majesty, slid amongst rest undistinguished multitude. Then Chancellor rose resumed. 'The information worthy Glump given us,' he said, 'might considerable import present moment, design already referred to, naturally takes precedence. His Majesty, unwilling proceed extremities, well aware measures sooner later result violent reactions, excogitated fundamental comprehensive measure, I need say more. Should His Majesty successful--as dares doubt?--then peace, advantage goblin kingdom, established generation least, rendered absolutely secure pledge His Royal Highness prince hold good behaviour her relatives. Should His Majesty fail--which shall dare even imagine his secret thoughts?--then time carrying rigour design Glump referred, preparations even completed. The failure former render latter imperative.' Curdie, perceiving assembly drawing close little chance either plan fully discovered, thought prudent make his escape goblins began disperse, slipped quietly away. There much danger meeting goblins, men least left behind palace; considerable danger his taking wrong turning, he light, therefore depend upon his memory his hands. After he left behind glow issued door Glump's new abode, he utterly without guide, far his eyes concerned. He anxious get back hole goblins return fetch remains furniture. It he least afraid them, but, utmost importance he thoroughly discover plans cherishing were, he must occasion slightest suspicion watched miner. He hurried on, feeling his way along walls rock. Had he courageous, he must anxious, he could know he lost his way would difficult thing world find again. Morning would bring light regions; towards least all, known special rhymester persecutor, could goblins expected exercise courtesy. Well might he wish he brought his lamp tinder-box him, he thought he crept eagerly goblins! He wished when, while, he found his way blocked up, could get farther. It use turn back, he least idea he begun go wrong. Mechanically, however, he kept feeling walls hemmed in. His hand came upon place tiny stream water running face rock. 'What stupid I am!' he said himself. 'I actually end journey! And goblins coming back fetch things!' he added, red glimmer torches appeared end long avenue led cave. In moment he thrown floor, wriggled backwards hole. The floor side several feet lower, made easier get back. It he could lift largest stone he taken hole, he manage shove again. He sat ore-heap thought. He pretty sure latter plan goblins inundate mine breaking outlets water accumulated natural reservoirs mountain, well running portions it. While part hollowed miners remained shut inhabited goblins, opportunity injuring thus; passage broken through, goblins' part proved higher mountain, clear Curdie mine could destroyed hour. Water always chief danger miners exposed. They met little choke-damp sometimes, never explosive firedamp common coal-mines. Hence careful soon saw appearance water. As result his reflections goblins busy old home, seemed Curdie would best build whole gang, filling stone, clay lie, smallest channel water get into. There not, however, immediate danger, execution goblins' plan contingent upon failure unknown design take precedence it; he anxious keep door communication open, he might possible discover former plan was. At time could resume intermitted labours inundation without his finding out; putting hands work, one existing outlet might single night rendered impenetrable weight water; filling gang entirely up, embankment would buttressed sides mountain itself. As soon he found goblins retired, he lighted his lamp, proceeded fill hole he made stones he could withdraw he pleased. He thought better, he might occasion good many nights this, go home sleep. How pleasant night air felt upon outside mountain he gone inside it! He hurried hill without meeting single goblin way, called tapped window he woke his father, soon rose let in. He told whole story; and, he expected, his father thought best work lode farther, time pretend occasionally work still order goblins might suspicions. Both father son went bed slept soundly morning. CHAPTER 10 The Princess's King-Papa The weather continued fine weeks, little princess went every day. So long period fine weather indeed never known upon mountain. The uncomfortable thing her nurse nervous particular sun often she would take her heels nothing worse fleecy cloud crossing sun threw shadow hillside; many evening home full hour sunlight left weather-cock stables. If odd behaviour Irene would time almost forgotten goblins. She never forgot Curdie, she remembered his sake, indeed would remembered princess never forgets her debts paid. One splendid sunshiny day, hour noon, Irene, playing lawn garden, heard distant blast bugle. She jumped cry joy, she knew particular blast her father his way see her. This part garden lay slope hill allowed full view country below. So she shaded her eyes her hand looked far away catch first glimpse shining armour. In moments little troop came glittering round shoulder hill. Spears helmets sparkling gleaming, banners flying, horses prancing, came bugle-blast her like voice her father calling across distance: 'Irene, I am coming.' On came she could clearly distinguish king. He rode white horse taller men him. He wore narrow circle gold set jewels around his helmet, he came still nearer Irene could discern flashing stones sun. It long time since he see her, her little heart beat faster faster shining troop approached, she loved her king-papa dearly nowhere happy his arms. When reached certain point, she could see garden, she ran gate, stood till came, clanging stamping, one bright bugle-blast said: 'Irene, I come.' By time people house gathered gate, Irene stood alone front them. When horsemen pulled she ran side white horse held her arms. The king stopped took her hands. In instant she saddle clasped his great strong arms. I wish I could describe king could see mind. He gentle, blue eyes, nose made look like eagle. A long dark beard, streaked silvery lines, flowed his mouth almost his waist, Irene sat saddle hid her glad face upon his bosom mingled golden hair her mother given her, two together like cloud streaks sun woven it. After he held her his heart minute he spoke his white horse, great beautiful creature, prancing proudly little before, walked gently lady--for he knew he little lady his back--through gate door house. Then king set her ground and, dismounting, took her hand walked her great hall, hardly ever entered except he came see his little princess. There he sat down, two his counsellors accompanied him, refreshment, Irene sat his right hand drank her milk wooden bowl curiously carved. After king eaten drunk he turned princess said, stroking her hair: 'Now, child, shall next?' This question he almost always put her first meal together; Irene waiting impatience, now, she thought, she able settle question constantly perplexed her. 'I like take see great old grandmother.' The king looked grave And said: 'What little daughter mean?' 'I mean Queen Irene lives tower--the old lady, know, long hair silver.' The king gazed his little princess look she could understand. 'She is got her crown her bedroom,' she went on; 'but I have yet. You know she is there, do not you?' 'No,' said king, quietly. 'Then must dream,' said Irene. 'I half thought was; I could not sure. Now I sure it. Besides, I could not find her next time I went up.' At moment snow-white pigeon flew open window settled upon Irene's head. She broke merry laugh, cowered little, put her hands her head, saying: 'Dear dovey, do not peck me. You will pull hair long claws do not mind.' The king stretched his hand take pigeon, spread wings flew open window, Whiteness made one flash sun vanished. The king laid his hand his princess's head, held back little, gazed her face, smiled half smile, sighed half sigh. 'Come, child; we will walk garden together,' he said. 'You will not come see huge, great, beautiful grandmother, then, king-papa?' said princess. 'Not time,' said king gently. 'She invited me, know, great old ladies like her choose visited without leave asked given.' The garden lovely place. Being upon Mountainside parts rocks came great masses, immediately remained quite wild. Tufts heather grew upon them, hardy mountain plants flowers, near would lovely roses lilies pleasant garden flowers. This mingling wild mountain civilized garden quaint, impossible number gardeners make garden look formal stiff. Against one rocks garden seat, shadowed afternoon sun overhanging rock itself. There little winding path top rock, top another seat; sat seat foot sun hot; talked together many things. At length king said: 'You late one evening, Irene.' 'Yes, papa. It fault; Lootie sorry.' 'I must talk Lootie it,' said king. 'Do not speak loud her, please, papa,' said Irene. 'She is afraid late ever since! Indeed she naughty. It mistake once.' 'Once might often,' murmured king himself, he stroked his child's head. I cannot tell he come know. I sure Curdie told him. Someone palace must seen them, all. He sat good thinking. There sound heard except little stream ran merrily opening rock sat, sped away hill garden. Then he rose and, leaving Irene she was, went house sent Lootie, he talk made her cry. When evening he rode away upon his great white horse, he left six his attendants behind him, orders three watch outside house every night, walking round round sunset sunrise. It clear he quite comfortable princess. CHAPTER 11 The Old Lady's Bedroom Nothing happened worth telling time. The autumn came went by. There flowers garden. The wind blew strong, howled among rocks. The rain fell, drenched yellow red leaves could get bare branches. Again would glorious morning followed pouring afternoon, sometimes, week together, would rain, nothing rain, day, lovely cloudless night, sky full-blown stars--not one missing. But princess could see much them, she went bed early. The winter drew on, she found things growing dreary. When stormy go out, she got tired her toys, Lootie would take her house, sometimes housekeeper's room, housekeeper, good, kind old woman, made much her--sometimes servants' hall kitchen, she princess merely, absolute queen, ran great risk spoiled. Sometimes she would run herself room men-at-arms king left sat, showed her arms accoutrements could amuse her. Still times she found dreary, often often wished her huge great grandmother dream. One morning nurse left her housekeeper while. To amuse her she turned contents old cabinet upon table. The little princess found her treasures, queer ancient ornaments, many things use she could imagine, far interesting her toys, sat playing two hours more. But, length, handling curious old-fashioned brooch, she ran pin her thumb, gave little scream sharpness pain, would thought little pain increased her thumb begun swell. This alarmed housekeeper greatly. The nurse fetched; doctor sent for; her hand poulticed, long her usual time she put bed. The pain still continued, although she fell asleep dreamed good many dreams, pain always every dream. At last woke her UP. The moon shining brightly room. The poultice fallen her hand burning hot. She fancied she could hold moonlight would cool it. So she got bed, without waking nurse lay end room, went window. When she looked she saw one men-at-arms walking garden moonlight glancing his armour. She going tap window call him, she wanted tell it, she bethought herself might wake Lootie, she would put her her bed again. So she resolved go window another room, call there. It much nicer somebody talk lie awake bed burning pain her hand. She opened door gently went nursery, look garden, go window. But she came foot old staircase moon shining window high up, making worm-eaten oak look strange delicate lovely. In moment she putting her little feet one silvery path stair, looking behind she went, see shadow made middle silver. Some little girls would afraid find thus alone middle night, Irene princess. As she went slowly stair, quite sure she dreaming, suddenly great longing woke her heart try whether she could find old lady silvery hair. 'If she dream,' she said herself, 'then I likelier find her, I dreaming.' So she went, stair stair, she Came many rooms--all she seen before. Through passage passage she softly sped, comforting herself she lose her way would matter much, she woke she would find herself her bed Lootie far off. But, she known every step way, she walked straight door foot narrow stair led tower. 'What I realreality-really find beautiful old grandmother there!' she said herself she crept steep steps. When she reached top she stood moment listening dark, moon there. Yes! was! hum spinning-wheel! What diligent grandmother work day night! She tapped gently door. 'Come in, Irene,'said sweet voice. The princess opened door entered. There moonlight streaming window, middle moonlight sat old lady her black dress white lace, her silvery hair mingling moonlight, could told which. 'Come in, Irene,' she said again. 'Can tell I spinning?' 'She speaks,' thought Irene, 'just she seen five minutes ago, yesterday farthest. --No,' she answered; 'I do not know spinning. Please, I thought dream. Why could not I find before, great-great-grandmother?' 'That hardly old enough understand. But would found sooner had not come think I dream. I give one reason though could not find me. I did not want find me.' 'Why, please?' 'Because I want Lootie know I here.' 'But told tell Lootie.' 'Yes. But I knew Lootie would believe you. If she see sitting spinning here, she would not believe me, either.' 'Why?' 'Because she could not. She would rub her eyes, go away say she felt queer, forget half more, say dream.' 'Just like me,' said Irene, feeling much ashamed herself. 'Yes, good deal like you, like you; you have come again; Lootie would not come again. She would said, No, no--she enough nonsense.' 'Is naughty Lootie, then?' 'It would naughty you. I have never done anything Lootie.' 'And wash face hands me,' said Irene, beginning cry. The old lady smiled sweet smile said: 'I am vexed you, child--nor Lootie either. But I do not want say anything Lootie me. If she ask you, must silent. But I think she ask you.' All time talked old lady kept spinning. 'You have not told yet I spinning,' she said. 'Because I do not know. It is pretty stuff.' It indeed pretty stuff. There good bunch distaff attached spinning-wheel, moonlight shone like--what shall I say like? It white enough silver--yes, like silver, shone grey rather white, glittered little. And thread old lady drew fine Irene could hardly see it. 'I spinning you, child.' 'For me! What I it, please?' 'I tell by. But first I tell is. It spider-web--of particular kind. My pigeons bring great sea. There one forest spiders live make particular kind--the finest strongest any. I nearly finished present job. What rock enough. I week's work yet, though,' she added, looking bunch. 'Do work day night, too, great-great-great-great-grandmother?' said princess, thinking polite many greats. 'I quite great that,' she answered, smiling almost merrily. 'If call grandmother, do. No, I do not work every night--only moonlit nights, longer moon shines upon wheel. I shall not work much longer tonight.' 'And next, grandmother?' 'Go bed. Would like see bedroom?' 'Yes, I should.' 'Then I think I will not work longer tonight. I shall good time.' The old lady rose, left her wheel standing was. You see good putting away, furniture danger untidy. Then she took Irene hand, her bad hand Irene gave little cry pain. 'My child!' said her grandmother, 'what matter?' Irene held her hand moonlight, old lady might see it, told her it, she looked grave. But she said: 'Give hand'; and, led her upon little dark landing, opened door opposite side it. What Irene's surprise see loveliest room she ever seen her life! It large lofty, dome-shaped. From centre hung lamp round ball, shining brightest moonlight, made everything visible room, though clearly princess could tell many things were. A large oval bed stood middle, coverlid rose colour, velvet curtains round lovely pale blue. The walls also blue--spangled looked like stars silver. The old lady left her and, going strange-looking cabinet, opened took curious silver casket. Then she sat low chair and, calling Irene, made her kneel her she looked her hand. Having examined it, she opened casket, took little ointment. The sweetest odour filled room--like roses lilies--as she rubbed ointment gently hot swollen hand. Her touch pleasant cool seemed drive away pain heat wherever came. 'Oh, grandmother! nice!' said Irene. 'Thank you; thank you.' Then old lady went chest drawers, took large handkerchief gossamer-like cambric, she tied round her hand. 'I do not think I let go away tonight,' she said. 'Would like sleep me?' 'Oh, yes, yes, dear grandmother,' said Irene, would clapped her hands, forgetting she could not. 'You will not afraid, then, go bed old woman?' 'No. You beautiful, grandmother.' 'But I old.' 'And I suppose I young. You will not mind sleeping young woman, grandmother?' 'You sweet little pertness!' said old lady, drew her towards her, kissed her forehead cheek mouth. Then she got large silver basin, poured water made Irene sit chair, washed her feet. This done, she ready bed. And oh, delicious bed her grandmother laid her! She hardly could told she lying upon anything: she felt nothing softness. The old lady undressed herself lay beside her. 'Why do not put moon?' asked princess. 'That never goes out, night day,' she answered. 'In darkest night, pigeons message, always see moon know fly to.' 'But somebody besides pigeons see it--somebody house, I mean--they would come look find you.' 'The better them, then,' said old lady. 'But happen five times hundred years anyone see it. The greater part take meteor, wink eyes, forget again. Besides, nobody could find room except I pleased. Besides, again--I tell secret--if light go would fancy lying bare garret, heap old straw, would see one pleasant things round time.' 'I hope never go out,' said princess. 'I hope not. But time went sleep. Shall I take arms?' The little princess nestled close old lady, took her her arms held her close her bosom. 'Oh, dear! nice!' said princess. 'I did not know anything world could comfortable. I like lie ever.' 'You may will,' said old lady. 'But I must put one trial-not hard one, I hope. This night week must come back me. If do not, I know may find again, soon want much.' 'Oh! please, do not let forget.' 'You shall forget. The question whether believe I anywhere--whether believe I anything dream. You may sure I I help come. But rest yourself, all. On night next Friday, must come me. Mind now.' 'I try,' said princess. 'Then good night,' said old lady, kissed forehead lay her bosom. In moment little princess dreaming midst loveliest dreams--of summer seas moonlight mossy springs great murmuring trees, beds wild flowers odours she never smelled before. But, all, dream could lovely she left behind she fell asleep. In morning she found herself her bed. There handkerchief anything else her hand, sweet odour lingered it. The swelling gone down; prick brooch vanished--in fact, her hand perfectly well. CHAPTER 12 A Short Chapter About Curdie Curdie spent many nights mine. His father he taken Mrs. Peterson secret, knew mother could hold her tongue, could said miners' wives. But Curdie tell her every night he spent mine, part went earning new red petticoat her. Mrs. Peterson nice good mother! All mothers nice good less, Mrs. Peterson nice good less. She made kept little heaven poor cottage high hillside her husband son go home low rather dreary earth worked. I doubt princess much happier even arms her huge great-grandmother Peter Curdie arms Mrs. Peterson. True, her hands hard chapped large, work them; therefore, sight angels, her hands much beautiful. And Curdie worked hard get her petticoat, she worked hard every day get comforts he would missed much she would new petticoat even winter. Not she Curdie ever thought much worked other: would spoiled everything. When left alone mine Curdie always worked hour two first, following lode which, according Glump, would lead last deserted habitation. After that, he would set reconnoitring expedition. In order manage this, rather return it, better first time, he bought huge ball fine string, learned trick Hop-of-my-Thumb, whose history his mother often told him. Not Hop-of-my-Thumb ever used ball string--I sorry supposed far classics--but principle pebbles. The end string he fastened his pickaxe, figured bad anchor, then, ball his hand, unrolling he went, set dark natural gangs goblins' territory. The first night two he came upon nothing worth remembering; saw little home-life cobs various caves called houses; failed coming upon anything cast light upon foregoing design kept inundation present background. But length, I think third fourth night, he found, partly guided noise implements, company evidently best sappers miners amongst them, hard work. What about? It could well inundation, seeing meantime postponed something else. Then it? He lurked watched, every greatest risk detected, without success. He retreat haste, proceeding rendered difficult he gather his string he returned upon course. It he afraid goblins, he afraid finding watched, might prevented discovery he aimed. Sometimes his haste that, he reached home towards morning, his string, lack time wind he 'dodged cobs', would seemed hopeless entanglement; good sleep, though short one, he always found his mother got right again. There was, wound respectable ball, ready use moment he want it! 'I cannot think it, mother,' he would say. 'I follow thread,' she would answer--'just mine.' She never say it; less clever she her words, clever she her hands; less his mother said, Curdie believed she say. But still he made discovery goblin miners about. CHAPTER 13 The Cobs' Creatures About time gentlemen king left behind watch princess occasion doubt testimony his eyes, strange objects would bear witness. They one sort--creatures--but grotesque misshapen like child's drawings upon his slate anything natural. They saw night, guard house. The testimony man first reported seen one that, he walking slowly round house, yet shadow, he caught sight creature standing hind legs moonlight, forefeet upon window-ledge, staring window. Its body might dog wolf, he thought, he declared his honour head twice size ought size body, round ball, face, turned upon fled, like one carved boy upon turnip inside he going put candle anything else he could think of. It rushed garden. He sent arrow it, thought he must struck it; gave unearthly howl, he could find his arrow beast, although he searched place vanished. They laughed he driven hold his tongue, said he must taken long pull ale-jug. But two nights he one side him, he, too, seen something strange, quite different reported other. The description second man gave creature he seen yet grotesque unlikely. They laughed rest; night night another came side, last one left laugh his companions. Two nights passed, he saw nothing; third he came rushing garden two house, agitation declared--for turn now--that band his helmet cracking his chin rising his hair inside it. Running part garden I already described, saw score creatures, one could give name, one like another, hideous ludicrous once, gambolling lawn moonlight. The supernatural rather subnatural ugliness faces, length legs necks some, apparent absence either others, made spectators, although one consent saw, yet doubtful, I said, evidence eyes--and ears well; noises made, although loud, uncouth varied forms, could described neither grunts squeaks roars howls barks yells screams croaks hisses mews shrieks, something like mingled one horrible dissonance. Keeping shade, watchers moments recover hideous assembly suspected presence; once, common consent, scampered direction great rock, vanished men come sufficiently think following them. My readers suspect were; I give full information concerning them. They were, course, household animals belonging goblins, whose ancestors taken ancestors many centuries upper regions light lower regions darkness. The original stocks horrible creatures much animals seen farms homes country, exception them, wild creatures, foxes, indeed wolves small bears, goblins, proclivity towards animal creation, caught cubs tamed. But course time undergone even greater changes passed upon owners. They altered--that is, descendants altered--into creatures I attempted describe except vaguest manner--the various parts bodies assuming, apparently arbitrary self-willed manner, abnormal developments. Indeed, little distinct type predominate bewildering results, could guessed known animal original, even then, likeness remained would one general expression definable conformation. But increased gruesomeness tenfold that, constant domestic, indeed rather family association goblins, countenances grown grotesque resemblance human. No one understands animals see every one them, even amongst fishes, may dimness vagueness infinitely remote, yet shadows human: case human resemblance greatly increased: owners sunk towards them, risen towards owners. But conditions subterranean life equally unnatural both, goblins worse, creatures improved approximation, result would appeared far ludicrous consoling warmest lover animal nature. I shall explain animals began show king's country house. The goblins, Curdie discovered, mining on--at work day night, divisions, urging scheme he lay wait. In course tunnelling broken channel small stream, break top it, water escaped interfere work. Some creatures, hovering often masters, found hole, had, curiosity grown passion restraints unnatural circumstances, proceeded explore channel. The stream ran seat Irene her king-papa sat I told, goblin creatures found jolly fun get romp smooth lawn never seen poor miserable lives. But although partaken enough nature owners delight annoying alarming people met mountain, were, course, incapable designs own, intentionally furthering masters. For several nights men-at-arms length one mind fact visits horrible creatures, whether bodily spectral could yet say, watched special attention part garden last seen them. Perhaps indeed gave consequence little attention house. But creatures cunning easily caught; watchers quick-eyed enough descry head, keen eyes it, which, opening whence stream issued, would watch turn, ready, moment leave lawn, report place clear. CHAPTER 14 That Night Week During whole week Irene thinking every moment her promise old lady, although even she could feel quite sure she dreaming. Could really old lady lived top house, pigeons spinning-wheel, lamp never went out? She was, however, none less determined, coming Friday, ascend three stairs, walk passages many doors, try find tower she either seen dreamed her grandmother. Her nurse could help wondering come child--she would sit thoughtfully silent, even midst game her would suddenly fall dreamy mood. But Irene took care betray nothing, whatever efforts Lootie might make get her thoughts. And Lootie say herself: 'What odd child she is!' give up. At length longed-for Friday arrived, lest Lootie moved watch her, Irene endeavoured keep herself quiet possible. In afternoon she asked her doll's house, went arranging rearranging various rooms inhabitants whole hour. Then she gave sigh threw herself back her chair. One dolls would sit, another would stand, tiresome. Indeed, one would even lie down, bad. But getting dark, darker got excited Irene became, she felt necessary composed. 'I see want tea, princess,' said nurse: 'I go get it. The room feels close: I open window little. The evening mild: will not hurt you.' 'There is fear that, Lootie,' said Irene, wishing she put going tea till darker, she might made her attempt every advantage. I fancy Lootie longer returning she intended; Irene, lost thought, looked up, she saw nearly dark, moment caught sight pair eyes, bright green light, glowering her open window. The next instant something leaped room. It like cat, legs long horse's, Irene said, body bigger legs thicker cat. She frightened cry out, frightened jump her chair run room. It plain enough every one readers she ought done--and indeed, Irene thought herself; she came foot old stair, outside nursery door, she imagined creature running long ascents her, pursuing her dark passages--which, all, might lead tower! That thought much. Her heart failed her, and, turning stair, she rushed along hall, whence, finding front door open, she darted court pursued--at least she thought so--by creature. No one happening see her, she ran, unable think fear, ready run anywhere elude awful creature stilt-legs. Not daring look behind her, she rushed straight gate mountain. It foolish indeed--thus run farther farther could help her, she seeking fit spot goblin creature eat her his leisure; way fear serves us: always sides thing afraid of. The princess soon breath running uphill; she ran on, she fancied horrible creature behind her, forgetting that, her long legs must overtaken her long ago. At last she could run longer, fell, unable even scream, roadside, she lay time half dead terror. But finding nothing lay hold her, her breath beginning come back, she ventured length get half peer anxiously her. It dark she could see nothing. Not single star out. She could even tell direction house lay, her home she fancied dreadful creature lying ready pounce upon her. She saw she ought run stairs once. It well she scream; for, although goblins come weeks, stray idler two might heard her. She sat upon stone, nobody one done something wrong could miserable. She quite forgotten her promise visit her grandmother. A raindrop fell her face. She looked up, moment her terror lost astonishment. At first she thought rising moon left her place, drawn nigh see could matter little girl, sitting alone, without hat cloak, dark bare mountain; she soon saw she mistaken, light ground her feet, shadow anywhere. But great silver globe hanging air; she gazed lovely thing, her courage revived. If she indoors again, she would fear nothing, even terrible creature long legs! But she find her way back? What could light be? Could be--? No, could not. But be--yes--it must be--her great-great-grandmother's lamp, guided her pigeons home darkest night! She jumped up: she keep light view she must find house. Her heart grew strong. Speedily, yet softly, she walked hill, hoping pass watching creature unseen. Dark was, little danger choosing wrong road. And--which strange--the light filled her eyes lamp, instead blinding moment object upon next fell, enabled her moment see it, despite darkness. By looking lamp dropping her eyes, she could see road yard two front her, saved her several falls, road rough. But once, her dismay, vanished, terror beast, left her moment she began return, laid hold her heart. The instant, however, she caught light windows, knew exactly she was. It dark run, she made haste she could, reached gate safety. She found house door still open, ran hall, and, without even looking nursery, bounded straight stair, next, next; turning right, ran long avenue silent rooms, found her way door foot tower stair. When first nurse missed her, she fancied she playing her trick, time took trouble her; last, getting frightened, she begun search; princess entered, whole household hither thither house, hunting her. A seconds she reached stair tower even begun search neglected rooms, would never thought looking already searched every place could think vain. But time she knocking old lady's door. CHAPTER 15 Woven Then Spun 'Come in, Irene,' said silvery voice her grandmother. The princess opened door peeped in. But room quite dark sound spinning-wheel. She grew frightened more, thinking that, although room there, old lady might dream all. Every little girl knows dreadful find room empty she thought somebody was; Irene fancy moment person she came find nowhere all. She remembered, however, night she spun moonlight, concluded must sweet, bee-like humming: old lady might somewhere darkness. Before she time think another thought, she heard her voice again, saying before: 'Come in, Irene.' From sound, she understood she room beside her. Perhaps she her bedroom. She turned across passage, feeling her way door. When her hand fell lock, old lady spoke: 'Shut door behind you, Irene. I always close door workroom I go chamber.' Irene wondered hear her voice plainly door: shut other, she opened went in. Oh, lovely reach darkness fear she come! The soft light made her feel she going heart milkiest pearl; blue walls silver stars moment perplexed her fancy reality sky she left outside minute ago covered rainclouds. 'I have lighted fire you, Irene: you are cold wet,' said her grandmother. Then Irene looked again, saw she taken huge bouquet red roses low stand wall fact fire burned shapes loveliest reddest roses, glowing gorgeously heads wings two cherubs shining silver. And she came nearer, she found smell roses room filled came fire-roses hearth. Her grandmother dressed loveliest pale blue velvet, her hair, longer white, rich golden colour, streamed like cataract, falling dull gathered heaps, rushing away smooth shining falls. And ever she looked, hair seemed pouring her head vanishing golden mist ere reached floor. It flowed edge circle shining silver, set alternated pearls opals. On her dress ornament whatever, neither ring her hand, necklace carcanet her neck. But her slippers glimmered light Milky Way, covered seed-pearls opals one mass. Her face woman three-and-twenty. The princess bewildered astonishment admiration she could hardly thank her, drew nigh timidity, feeling dirty uncomfortable. The lady seated low chair side fire, hands outstretched take her, princess hung back troubled smile. 'Why, what is matter?' asked her grandmother. 'You have not anything wrong--I know face, though rather miserable. What is matter, dear?' And she still held her arms. 'Dear grandmother,' said Irene, 'I am sure I have not done something wrong. I ought run long-legged cat came window, instead running mountain making fright.' 'You taken surprise, child, likely again. It people wrong things wilfully likely again. Come.' And still she held her arms. 'But, grandmother, you are beautiful grand crown on; I dirty mud rain! I quite spoil beautiful blue dress.' With merry little laugh lady sprung her chair, lightly far Irene herself could, caught child her bosom, and, kissing tear-stained face over, sat her her lap. 'Oh, grandmother! You will make mess!' cried Irene, clinging her. 'You darling! think I care dress little girl? Besides--look here.' As she spoke she set her down, Irene saw her dismay lovely dress covered mud her fall mountain road. But lady stooped fire, taking it, stalk her fingers, one burning roses, passed third time front her dress; Irene looked, single stain discovered. 'There!' said her grandmother, 'you will not mind coming now?' But Irene hung back, eying flaming rose lady held her hand. 'You are afraid rose--are you?' she said, throw hearth again. 'Oh! do not, please!' cried Irene. 'Will not hold frock hands face? And I am afraid feet knees want too.' 'No, answered her grandmother, smiling little sadly, she threw rose her; 'it hot yet. It would set frock flame. Besides, I do not want make clean tonight. I want nurse rest people see are, tell ran away fear long-legged cat. I like wash you, would believe then. Do see bath behind you?' The princess looked, saw large oval tub silver, shining brilliantly light wonderful lamp. 'Go look it,' said lady. Irene went, came back silent her eyes shining. 'What see?' asked her grandmother. 'The sky, moon stars,' she answered. 'It looked bottom it.' The lady smiled pleased satisfied smile, silent also moments. Then she said: 'Any time want bath, come me. I know YOU bath every morning, sometimes want one night, too.' 'Thank you, grandmother; I will--I indeed,' answered Irene, silent moments thinking. Then she said: 'How it, grandmother, I saw beautiful lamp--not light only--but great round silvery lamp itself, hanging alone great open air, high up? It lamp I saw--was not it?' 'Yes, child--it lamp.' 'Then it? I do not see window round.' 'When I please I make lamp shine walls--shine strong melts away sight, shows saw it. But, I told you, everybody see it.' 'How I can, then? I am sure I do not know.' 'It gift born you. And one day I hope everybody it.' 'But make shine walls?' 'Ah! would understand I try ever much make you--not yet--not yet. But,' added lady, rising, 'you must sit chair I get present I preparing you. I told spinning you. It finished now, I going fetch it. I keeping warm one brooding pigeons.' Irene sat low chair, her grandmother left her, shutting door behind her. The child sat gazing, rose fire, starry walls, silver light; great quietness grew her heart. If long-legged cats world come rushing her she would afraid moment. How she could tell--she knew fear her, everything right safe could get in. She gazing lovely lamp minutes fixedly: turning her eyes, she found wall vanished, she looking dark cloudy night. But though she heard wind blowing, none blew upon her. In moment clouds parted, rather vanished like wall, she looked straight starry herds, flashing gloriously dark blue. It moment. The clouds gathered shut stars; wall gathered shut clouds; stood lady beside her loveliest smile her face, shimmering ball her hand, size pigeon's egg. 'There, Irene; work you!' she said, holding ball princess. She took her hand, looked over. It sparkled little, shone there, much. It sort grey-whiteness, something like spun glass. 'Is spinning, grandmother?' she asked.  since came house. There think.' 'How pretty is! What I it, please?' 'That I explain you,' answered lady, turning her going her cabinet. She came back small ring her hand. Then she took ball Irene's, something ring--Irene could tell what. 'Give hand,' she said. Irene held her right hand. 'Yes, hand I want,' said lady, put ring forefinger it. 'What beautiful ring!' said Irene. 'What stone called?' 'It fire-opal.' 'Please, I keep it?' 'Always.' 'Oh, thank you, grandmother! It is prettier anything I ever saw, except those--of colours-in your--Please, crown?' 'Yes, crown. The stone ring sort--only good. It red, mine colours, see.' 'Yes, grandmother. I take care it! But--' she added, hesitating. 'But what?' asked her grandmother. 'What I say Lootie asks I got it?' 'You ask her got it,' answered lady smiling. 'I do not see I that.' 'You will, though.' 'Of course I will, say so. But, know, I cannot pretend know.' 'Of course not. But do not trouble it. You see time comes.' So saying, lady turned, threw little ball rose fire. 'Oh, grandmother!' exclaimed Irene; 'I thought spun me.' 'So I did, child. And you have got it.' 'No; it is burnt fire!' The lady put her hand fire, brought ball, glimmering before, held towards her. Irene stretched her hand take it, lady turned and, going her cabinet, opened drawer, laid ball it. 'Have I done anything vex you, grandmother?' said Irene pitifully. 'No, darling. But must understand one ever gives anything another properly really without keeping it. That ball yours.' 'Oh! I am take me! You going keep me!' 'You take you. I have fastened end ring finger.' Irene looked ring. 'I cannot see there, grandmother,' she said. 'Feel--a little way ring--towards cabinet,' said lady. 'Oh! I feel it!' exclaimed princess. 'But I cannot see it,' she added, looking close her outstretched hand. 'No. The thread fine see it. You feel it. Now fancy much spinning took, although seem little ball.' 'But use I make it, lies cabinet?' 'That I explain you. It would use you--it would not lie cabinet. Now listen. If ever find danger--such, example, evening--you must take ring put pillow bed. Then must lay finger, wore ring, upon thread, follow thread wherever leads you.' 'Oh, delightful! It lead you, grandmother, I know!' 'Yes. But, remember, may seem roundabout way indeed, must doubt thread. Of one thing may sure, hold it, I hold too.' 'It wonderful!' said Irene thoughtfully. Then suddenly becoming aware, she jumped up, crying: 'Oh, grandmother! I sitting time chair, standing! I beg pardon.' The lady laid her hand her shoulder, said: 'Sit again, Irene. Nothing pleases better see anyone sit chair. I glad stand long anyone sit it.' 'How kind you!' said princess, sat again. 'It makes happy,' said lady. 'But,' said Irene, still puzzled, 'will not thread get somebody is way broken, one end fast ring, laid cabinet?' 'You find arrange itself. I afraid time go.' 'Might not I stay sleep tonight, grandmother?' 'No, tonight. If I meant stay tonight, I given bath; know everybody house miserable you, would cruel keep night. You must go downstairs.' 'I am glad, grandmother, did not say "Go home," home. May not I call home?' 'You may, child. And I trust always think home. Now come. I must take back without anyone seeing you.' 'Please, I want ask one question more,' said Irene. 'Is crown look young?' 'No, child,' answered her grandmother; 'it I felt young evening I put crown on. And I thought would like see old grandmother her best.' 'Why call old? You are old, grandmother.' 'I old indeed. It silly people--I do not mean you, tiny, could not know better--but silly people fancy old age means crookedness witheredness feebleness sticks spectacles rheumatism forgetfulness! It silly! Old age nothing whatever that. The right old age means strength beauty mirth courage clear eyes strong painless limbs. I older able think, and--' 'And look you, grandmother!' cried Irene, jumping flinging her arms her neck. 'I will not silly again, I promise you. At least--I am rather afraid promise--but I am, I promise sorry it--I do. I wish I old you, grandmother. I do not think ever afraid anything.' 'Not long, least, child. Perhaps time I two thousand years age, I shall, indeed, never afraid anything. But I confess I sometimes afraid children--sometimes you, Irene.' 'Oh, I am sorry, grandmother! Tonight, I suppose, mean.' 'Yes--a little tonight; good deal made mind I dream, real great-great-grandmother. You must suppose I blaming that. I dare say could help it.' 'I do not know, grandmother,' said princess, beginning cry. 'I cannot always I like. And I do not always try. I am sorry anyhow.' The lady stooped, lifted her her arms, sat her her chair, holding her close her bosom. In minutes princess sobbed herself sleep. How long she slept I know. When she came herself she sitting her high chair nursery table, her doll's house her. CHAPTER 16 The Ring The moment her nurse came room, sobbing. When she saw her sitting she started back loud cry amazement joy. Then running her, she caught her her arms covered her kisses. 'My precious darling princess! been? What happened you? We have crying eyes out, searching house top bottom you.' 'Not quite top,' thought Irene herself; she might added, 'not quite bottom', perhaps, she known all. But one she would not, she could say. 'Oh, Lootie! I have dreadful adventure!' she replied, told her cat long legs, she ran upon mountain, came back again. But she said nothing her grandmother her lamp. 'And we have searching house hour half!' exclaimed nurse. 'But that is matter, we have got you! Only, princess, I must say,' she added, her mood changing, 'what ought done call Lootie come help you, instead running house, mountain, wild, I must say, foolish fashion.' 'Well, Lootie,' said Irene quietly, 'perhaps big cat, legs, running you, might exactly know wisest thing moment.' 'I would not run mountain, anyhow,' returned Lootie. 'Not time think it. But creatures came night mountain, frightened lost way home.' This put stop Lootie's reproaches. She point saying long-legged cat must twilight fancy princess's, memory horrors night, talking-to king given her consequence, prevented her saying she half believe--having strong suspicion cat goblin; she knew nothing difference goblins creatures: she counted goblins. Without another word she went got fresh tea bread butter princess. Before she returned, whole household, headed housekeeper, burst nursery exult darling. The gentlemen-at-arms followed, ready enough believe she told long-legged cat. Indeed, though wise enough say nothing it, remembered, little horror, creature amongst surprised gambols upon princess's lawn. In hearts blamed kept better watch. And captain gave orders night front door windows ground floor locked immediately sun set, opened upon pretence whatever. The men-at-arms redoubled vigilance, time alarm. When princess woke next morning, her nurse bending her. 'How ring glow morning, princess!--just like fiery rose!' she said. 'Does it, Lootie?' returned Irene. 'Who gave ring, Lootie? I know I have long time, I get it? I do not remember.' 'I think must mother gave you, princess; really, long worn it, I do not remember ever I heard,' answered her nurse. 'I ask king-papa next time he comes,' said Irene. CHAPTER 17 Springtime The spring dear creatures, young old, came last, first days gone, king rode budding valleys see his little daughter. He distant part his dominions winter, he habit stopping one great city, visiting his favourite country houses, he moved place place, his people might know him. Wherever he journeyed, he kept constant look-out ablest best men put office; wherever he found mistaken, he appointed incapable unjust, he removed once. Hence see his care people kept seeing his princess often he would liked. You may wonder he take her him; several reasons his so, I suspect her great-great-grandmother principal hand preventing it. Once Irene heard bugle-blast, she gate meet her father he rode his great white horse. After alone little while, she thought she resolved ask him. 'Please, king-papa,' she said, 'Will tell I got pretty ring? I cannot remember.' The king looked it. A strange beautiful smile spread like sunshine his face, answering smile, time questioning one, spread like moonlight Irene's. 'It queen-mamma's once,' he said. 'And is not now?' asked Irene. 'She want now,' said king, looking grave. 'Why does not she want now?' 'Because she is gone rings made.' 'And shall I see her?' asked princess. 'Not time yet,' answered king, tears came his eyes. Irene remember her mother know her father looked so, tears came his eyes; she put her arms round his neck kissed him, asked questions. The king much disturbed hearing report gentlemen-at-arms concerning creatures seen; I presume would taken Irene day, presence ring her finger assured of. About hour he left, Irene saw go old stair; he come till ready start; she thought herself he see old lady. When he went away he left six gentlemen behind him, might six always guard. And now, lovely spring weather, Irene mountain greater part day. In warmer hollows lovely primroses, many she ever got tired them. As often she saw new one opening eye light blind earth, she would clap her hands gladness, unlike children I know, instead pulling it, would touch tenderly new baby, and, made acquaintance, would leave happy she found it. She treated plants grew like birds' nests; every fresh flower like new little bird her. She would pay visits flower-nests she knew, remembering itself. She would go her hands knees beside one say: 'Good morning! Are smelling sweet morning? Good-bye!' she would go another nest, say same. It favourite amusement her. There many flowers down, she loved all, primroses her favourites. 'They are shy, they are bit forward,' she would say Lootie. There goats about, mountain, little kids came she pleased flowers. The goats belonged miners mostly-a Curdie's mother; good many wild ones seemed belong nobody. These goblins counted theirs, upon partly lived. They set snares dug pits them; scruple take tame ones happened caught; try steal manner, afraid dogs hill-people kept watch them, knowing dogs always tried bite feet. But goblins kind sheep own--very queer creatures, drove feed night, goblin creatures wise enough keep good watch them, knew bones by. CHAPTER 18 Curdie's Clue Curdie watchful ever, almost getting tired his ill success. Every night he followed goblins about, went digging boring, getting near he could, watched behind stones rocks; yet he seemed nearer finding view. As first, he always kept hold end his string, his pickaxe, left outside hole he entered goblins' country mine, continued serve anchor hold fast end. The goblins, hearing noise quarter, ceased apprehend immediate invasion, kept watch. One night, dodging listening till he nearly falling asleep weariness, he began roll his ball, he resolved go home bed. It long, however, he began feel bewildered. One another he passed goblin houses, caves, is, occupied goblin families, length sure many he passed he came. He use great caution pass unseen--they lay close together. Could his string led wrong? He still followed winding it, still led thickly populated quarters, he became quite uneasy, indeed apprehensive; although he afraid cobs, he afraid finding his way out. But could he do? It use sit wait morning--the morning made difference here. It dark, always dark; his string failed he helpless. He might even arrive within yard mine never know it. Seeing he could nothing better he would least find end his string was, and, possible, come play trick. He knew size ball he getting pretty near last it, he began feel tugging pulling it. What could mean? Turning sharp corner, he thought he heard strange sounds. These grew, he went on, scuffling growling squeaking; noise increased, until, turning second sharp corner, he found midst it, moment tumbled wallowing mass, he knew must knot cobs' creatures. Before he could recover his feet, he caught great scratches his face several severe bites his legs arms. But he scrambled get up, his hand fell upon his pickaxe, horrid beasts could serious harm, he laying right left dark. The hideous cries followed gave satisfaction knowing he punished pretty smartly rudeness, scampering retreating howls, he perceived he routed them. He stood little, weighing his battle-axe his hand precious lump metal--but indeed lump gold could precious time common tool--then untied end string it, put ball his pocket, still stood thinking. It clear cobs' creatures found his axe, carried off, led he knew where. But his thinking he could tell he ought do, suddenly he became aware glimmer light distance. Without moment's hesitation he set it, fast unknown rugged way would permit. Yet turning corner, led dim light, he spied something quite new his experience underground regions--a small irregular shape something shining. Going it, he found piece mica, Muscovy glass, called sheep-silver Scotland, light flickered fire behind it. After trying vain time discover entrance place burning, he came length small chamber opening, high wall, revealed glow beyond. To opening he managed scramble up, he saw strange sight. Below sat little group goblins around fire, smoke vanished darkness far aloft. The sides cave full shining minerals like palace hall; company evidently superior order, every one wore stones head, arms, waist, shining dull gorgeous colours light fire. Nor Curdie looked long he recognized king himself, found he made his way inner apartment royal family. He never good chance hearing something. He crept hole softly he could, scrambled good way wall towards without attracting attention, sat listened. The king, evidently queen, probably crown prince Prime Minister talking together. He sure queen her shoes, she warmed her feet fire, he saw quite plainly. 'That fun!' said one he took crown prince. It first whole sentence he heard. 'I do not see think grand affair!' said his stepmother, tossing her head backward. 'You must remember, spouse,' interposed His Majesty, making excuse his son, 'he got blood him. His mother--' 'Do not talk his mother! You positively encourage his unnatural fancies. Whatever belongs mother ought cut him.' 'You forget yourself, dear!' said king. 'I do not,' said queen, 'nor either. If expect approve coarse tastes, find mistaken. I do not wear shoes nothing.' 'You must acknowledge, however,' king said, little groan, 'that least whim Harelip's, matter State policy. You well aware his gratification comes purely pleasure sacrificing public good. Does not, Harelip?' 'Yes, father; course does. Only nice make her cry. I will skin taken her toes, tie till grow together. Then her feet like people's, occasion her wear shoes.' 'Do mean insinuate I have got toes, unnatural wretch?' cried queen; she moved angrily towards Harelip. The councillor, however, betwixt them, leaned forward prevent her touching him, address prince. 'Your Royal Highness,' he said, 'possibly requires reminded got three toes yourself--one one foot, two other.' 'Ha! ha! ha!' shouted queen triumphantly. The councillor, encouraged mark favour, went on. 'It seems me, Your Royal Highness, would greatly endear future people, proving less one misfortune born sun-mother, command upon comparatively slight operation which, extended form, wisely meditate regard future princess.' 'Ha! ha! ha!' laughed queen louder before, king minister joined laugh. Harelip growled, moments others continued express enjoyment his discomfiture. The queen one Curdie could see distinctness. She sat sideways him, light fire shone full upon her face. He could consider her handsome. Her nose certainly broader end extreme length, her eyes, instead horizontal, set like two perpendicular eggs, one broad, small end. Her mouth bigger small buttonhole she laughed, stretched ear ear--only, sure, her ears nearly middle her cheeks. Anxious hear everything might say, Curdie ventured slide smooth part rock him, projection below, upon he thought rest. But whether he careful enough, projection gave way, he came rush floor cavern, bringing great rumbling shower stones. The goblins jumped seats anger consternation, never yet seen anything afraid palace. But saw Curdie his pick his hand rage mingled fear, took first invasion miners. The king notwithstanding drew his full height four feet, spread his full breadth three half, he handsomest squarest goblins, strutting Curdie, planted outspread feet him, said dignity: 'Pray right palace?' 'The right necessity, Your Majesty,' answered Curdie. 'I lost way know I wandering to.' 'How get in?' 'By hole mountain.' 'But miner! Look pickaxe!' Curdie look it, answering: 'I came upon lying ground little way here. I tumbled wild beasts playing it. Look, Your Majesty.' And Curdie showed he scratched bitten. The king pleased find behave politely he expected his people told concerning miners, he attributed power his presence; he therefore feel friendly intruder. 'You oblige walking dominions once,' he said, well knowing mockery lay words. 'With pleasure, Your Majesty give guide,' said Curdie. 'I give thousand,' said king scoffing air magnificent liberality. 'One quite sufficient,' said Curdie. But king uttered strange shout, half halloo, half roar, rushed goblins till cave swarming. He said something first Curdie could hear, passed one another till moment farthest crowd evidently heard understood it. They began gather way he relish, he retreated towards wall. They pressed upon him. 'Stand back,' said Curdie, grasping his pickaxe tighter his knee. They grinned pressed closer. Curdie bethought began rhyme. 'Ten, twenty, thirty-- You are dirty! Twenty, thirty, forty-- You are thick snorty! 'Thirty, forty, fifty-- You are puff-and-snifty! Forty, fifty, sixty-- Beast man mixty! 'Fifty, sixty, seventy-- Mixty, maxty, leaventy! Sixty, seventy, eighty-- All cheeks slaty! 'Seventy, eighty, ninety, All hands flinty! Eighty, ninety, hundred, Altogether dundred!' The goblins fell back little he began, made horrible grimaces rhyme, eating something disagreeable set teeth edge gave creeps; whether rhyming words words all, for, new rhyme considered efficacious, Curdie made spur moment, whether presence king queen gave courage, I cannot tell; moment rhyme crowded again, shot hundred long arms, multitude thick nailless fingers ends them, lay hold upon him. Then Curdie heaved his axe. But gentle courageous wishing kill them, he turned end square blunt like hammer, came great blow head goblin nearest him. Hard heads goblins are, he thought he must feel that. And he did, doubt; he gave horrible cry, sprung Curdie's throat. Curdie, however, drew back time, critical moment remembered vulnerable part goblin body. He made sudden rush king stamped his might His Majesty's feet. The king gave unkingly howl almost fell fire. Curdie rushed crowd, stamping right left. The goblins drew back, howling every side he approached, crowded he attacked could escape his tread; shrieking roaring filled cave would appalled Curdie good hope gave him. They tumbling heaps eagerness rush cave, new assailant suddenly faced him--the queen, flaming eyes expanded nostrils, her hair standing half her head, rushed him. She trusted her shoes: granite--hollowed like French sabots. Curdie would endured much rather hurt woman, even she goblin; affair life death: forgetting her shoes, he made great stamp one her feet. But she instantly returned different effect, causing frightful pain, almost disabling him. His chance her would attack granite shoes his pickaxe, he could think she caught her arms rushing across cave. She dashed hole wall, force almost stunned him. But although he could move, he far gone hear her great cry, rush multitudes soft feet, followed sounds something heaved rock; came multitudinous patter stones falling near him. The last ceased he grew faint, his head badly cut, last insensible. When he came perfect silence him, utter darkness, merest glimmer one tiny spot. He crawled it, found heaved slab mouth hole, past edge poor little gleam found way fire. He could move hairbreadth, piled great heap stones it. He crawled back he lying, faint hope finding his pickaxe, But vain search he last compelled acknowledge evil plight. He sat tried think, soon fell fast asleep. CHAPTER 19 Goblin Counsels He must slept long time, he awoke he felt wonderfully restored--indeed almost well--and hungry. There voices outer cave. Once more, then, night; goblins slept day went affairs night. In universal constant darkness dwelling reason prefer one arrangement other; aversion sun-people chose busy least chance met either miners below, burrowing, people mountain above, feeding sheep catching goats. And indeed sun away outside mountain sufficiently like dismal regions endurable mole eyes, thoroughly become unaccustomed light beyond fires torches. Curdie listened, soon found talking himself. 'How long take?' asked Harelip. 'Not many days, I think,' answered king. 'They poor feeble creatures, sun-people, want always eating. We go week time without food, better it; I have told eat two three times every day! Can believe it? They must quite hollow inside--not like us, nine-tenths whose bulk solid flesh bone. Yes--I judge week starvation him.' 'If I may allowed word,' interposed queen,--'and I think I ought voice matter--' 'The wretch entirely disposal, spouse,' interrupted king. 'He property. You caught yourself. We never done it.' The queen laughed. She seemed far better humour night before. 'I say,' she resumed, 'that seem pity waste much fresh meat.' 'What thinking of, love?' said king. 'The notion starving implies going give meat, either salt fresh.' 'I am stupid comes to,' returned Her Majesty. 'What I mean time he starved hardly picking upon his bones.' The king gave great laugh. 'Well, spouse, may like,' he said. 'I do not fancy part. I pretty sure he tough eating.' 'That would honour instead punish his insolence,' returned queen. 'But poor creatures deprived much nourishment? Our little dogs cats pigs small bears would enjoy much.' 'You best housekeepers, lovely queen!' said her husband. 'Let means. Let us people in, get kill once. He deserves it. The mischief he might brought upon us, he penetrated far retired citadel, incalculable. Or rather let us tie hand foot, pleasure seeing torn pieces full torchlight great hall.' 'Better better!' cried queen prince together, clapping hands. And prince made ugly noise his hare-lip, he intended one feast. 'But,' added queen, bethinking herself, 'he troublesome. For poor creatures are, something sun-people troublesome. I cannot imagine superior strength skill understanding ours, permit exist all. Why destroy entirely, use cattle grazing lands pleasure? Of course do not want live horrid country! It far glaring quieter refined tastes. But might use sort outhouse, know. Even creatures' eyes might get used it, grow blind would consequence, provided grew fat well. But might even keep great cows creatures, luxuries, cream cheese, present taste occasionally, brave men succeeded carrying farms.' 'It worth thinking of,' said king; 'and I do not know first suggest it, except positive genius conquest. But still, say, something troublesome them; would better, I understand suggest, starve day two first, he may little less frisky take out.' 'Once goblin Living hole; Busy he cobblin' A shoe without sole. 'By came birdie: "Goblin, do?" "Cobble sturdie Upper leather shoe." '"What is good that, Sir?" Said little bird. "Why it is Pat, Sir-- Plain without word. '"Where it is hole, Sir, Never holes: Why shoes soles, Sir, When they have got souls?"' 'What is horrible noise?' cried queen, shuddering pot-metal head granite shoes. 'I declare,' said king solemn indignation, 'it is sun-creature hole!' 'Stop disgusting noise!' cried crown prince valiantly, getting standing front heap stones, his face towards Curdie's prison. 'Do now, I will break head.' 'Break away,' shouted Curdie, began singing again: 'Once goblin, Living hole--' 'I really cannot bear it,' said queen. 'If I could get his horrid toes slippers again!' 'I think better go bed,' said king. 'It is time go bed,' said queen. 'I would I you,' said Curdie. 'Impertinent wretch!' said queen, utmost scorn her voice. 'An impossible if,' said His Majesty dignity. 'Quite,' returned Curdie, began singing again: 'Go bed, Goblin, do. Help queen Take her shoe. 'If do, It disclose A horrid set Of sprouting toes.' 'What lie!' roared queen rage. 'By way, reminds me,' said king, 'that long married, I never seen feet, queen. I think might take shoes go bed! They positively hurt sometimes.' 'I I like,' retorted queen sulkily. 'You ought hubby wishes you,' said king. 'I not,' said queen. 'Then I insist upon it,' said king. Apparently His Majesty approached queen purpose following advice given Curdie, latter heard scuffle, great roar king. 'Will quiet, then?' said queen wickedly. 'Yes, yes, queen. I meant coax you.' 'Hands off!' cried queen triumphantly. 'I am going bed. You may come like. But long I queen I sleep shoes. It royal privilege. Harelip, go bed.' 'I am going,' said Harelip sleepily. 'So I,' said king. 'Come along, then,' said queen; 'and mind good, I will--' 'Oh, no, no, no!' screamed king supplicating tones. Curdie heard muttered reply distance; cave quite still. They left fire burning, light came brighter before. Curdie thought time try anything could done. But he found he could get even finger chink slab rock. He gave great rush his shoulder slab, yielded part rock. All he could sit think again. By he came resolution pretend dying, hope might take his strength much exhausted let chance. Then, creatures, he could find his axe again, he would fear them; queen's horrid shoes, he would fear all. Meantime, come night, nothing forge new rhymes, his weapons. He intention using present, course; well stock, he might live want them, manufacture would help away time. CHAPTER 20 Irene's Clue That morning early, princess woke terrible fright. There hideous noise her room--creatures snarling hissing rocketing fighting. The moment she came herself, she remembered something she never thought again--what her grandmother told her she frightened. She immediately took her ring put her pillow. As she she fancied she felt finger thumb take gently her palm. 'It must grandmother!' she said herself, thought gave her courage she stopped put her dainty little slippers running room. While she caught sight long cloak sky-blue, thrown back chair bedside. She never seen evidently waiting her. She put on, then, feeling forefinger her right hand, soon found her grandmother's thread, she proceeded follow, expecting would lead her straight old stair. When she reached door she found went ran along floor, she almost crawl order keep hold it. Then, her surprise, somewhat her dismay, she found instead leading her towards stair turned quite opposite direction. It led her certain narrow passages towards kitchen, turning aside ere she reached it, guiding her door communicated small back yard. Some maids already up, door standing open. Across yard thread still ran along ground, brought her door wall opened upon Mountainside. When she passed through, thread rose half her height, she could hold ease she walked. It led her straight mountain. The her alarm less frightful she supposed. The cook's great black cat, pursued housekeeper's terrier, bounced her bedroom door, properly fastened, two burst room together commenced battle royal. How nurse came sleep mystery, I suspect old lady something it. It clear warm morning. The wind blew deliciously Mountainside. Here she saw late primrose she stop call upon them. The sky mottled small clouds. The sun yet up, fluffy edges caught his light, hung orange gold-coloured fringes upon air. The dew lay round drops upon leaves, hung like tiny diamond ear-rings blades grass her path. 'How lovely bit gossamer is!' thought princess, looking long undulating line shone distance her hill. It time gossamers though; Irene soon discovered her thread she saw shining her light morning. It leading her she knew whither; she never her life sunrise, everything fresh cool lively full something coming, she felt happy afraid anything. After leading her good distance, thread turned left, path upon she Lootie met Curdie. But she never thought that, morning light, far outlook country, path could open airy cheerful. She could see road almost horizon, along she often watched her king-papa his troop come shining, bugle-blast cleaving air them; like companion her. Down path went, up, again, getting rugged rugged went; still along path went silvery thread, still along thread went Irene's little rosy-tipped forefinger. By she came little stream jabbered prattled hill, side stream went path thread. And still path grew rougher steeper, mountain grew wilder, till Irene began think she going long way home; she turned look back she saw level country vanished rough bare mountain closed her. But still went thread, went princess. Everything around her getting brighter brighter sun came nearer; till length his first rays alighted top rock her, like golden creature fresh sky. Then she saw little stream ran hole rock, path go past rock, thread leading her straight it. A shudder ran her head foot she found thread actually taking her hole stream ran. It ran babbling joyously, she go in. She hesitate. Right hole she went, high enough let her walk without stooping. For little way brown glimmer, first turn ceased, she gone many paces she total darkness. Then she began frightened indeed. Every moment she kept feeling thread backwards forwards, she went farther farther darkness great hollow mountain, she kept thinking her grandmother, she said her, kind she been, beautiful she was, her lovely room, fire roses, great lamp sent light stone walls. And she became sure thread could gone itself, her grandmother must sent it. But tried her dreadfully path went steep, especially When she came places she go rough stairs, even sometimes ladder. Through one narrow passage another, lumps rock sand clay, thread guided her, she came small hole she creep. Finding change side, 'Shall I ever get back?' she thought, again, wondering herself she ten times frightened, often feeling she walking story dream. Sometimes she heard noise water, dull gurgling inside rock. By she heard sounds blows, came nearer nearer; grew duller, almost died away. In hundred directions she turned, obedient guiding thread. At last she spied dull red shine, came mica window, thence away round about, right, cavern, glowed red embers fire. Here thread began rise. It rose high her head higher still. What she she lost her hold? She pulling down: She might break it! She could see far up, glowing red her fire-opal light embers. But presently she came huge heap stones, piled slope wall cavern. On she climbed, soon recovered level thread however find, next moment, vanished heap stones, left her standing it, her face solid rock. For one terrible moment she felt her grandmother forsaken her. The thread spiders spun far seas, her grandmother sat moonlight spun her, she tempered rose-fire tied her opal ring, left her--had gone she could longer follow it--had brought her horrible cavern, left her! She forsaken indeed! 'When shall I wake?' she said herself agony, moment knew dream. She threw herself upon heap, began cry. It well she know creatures, one stone shoes her feet, lying next cave. But neither she know side slab. At length thought struck her least she could follow thread backwards, thus get mountain, home. She rose once, found thread. But instant she tried feel backwards, vanished her touch. Forwards, led her hand heap stones--backwards seemed nowhere. Neither could she see light fire. She burst wailing cry, threw herself stones. CHAPTER 21 The Escape As princess lay sobbed she kept feeling thread mechanically, following her finger many times stones disappeared. By she began, still mechanically, poke her finger stones far she could. All came her head she might remove stones see thread went next. Almost laughing herself never thought before, she jumped her feet. Her fear vanished; she certain her grandmother's thread could brought her leave her there; she began throw away stones top fast she could, sometimes two three handful, sometimes taking hands lift one. After clearing away little, she found thread turned went straight downwards. Hence, heap sloped good deal, growing course wider towards base, she throw away multitude stones follow thread. But all, she soon found thread, going straight little way, turned first sideways one direction, sideways another, shot, various angles, hither thither inside heap, she began afraid clear thread she must remove whole huge gathering. She dismayed idea, but, losing time, set work will; aching back, bleeding fingers hands, she worked on, sustained pleasure seeing heap slowly diminish begin show opposite side fire. Another thing helped keep her courage that, often she uncovered turn thread, instead lying loose upon stone, tightened up; made her sure her grandmother end somewhere. She got half-way she started, nearly fell fright. Close her ears seemed, voice broke singing: 'Jabber, bother, smash! You will crash. Jabber, smash, bother! You will worst pother. Smash, bother, jabber!--' Here Curdie stopped, either he could find rhyme 'jabber', he remembered he forgotten he woke sound Irene's labours, his plan make goblins think he getting weak. But he uttered enough let Irene know he was. 'It is Curdie!' she cried joyfully. 'Hush! hush!' came Curdie's voice somewhere. 'Speak softly.' 'Why, singing loud!' said Irene. 'Yes. But know I here, do not know are. Who you?' 'I am Irene,' answered princess. 'I know quite well. You are Curdie.' 'Why, ever come here, Irene?' 'My great-great-grandmother sent me; I think I have found why. You cannot get out, I suppose?' 'No, I cannot. What doing?' 'Clearing away huge heap stones.' 'There is princess!' exclaimed Curdie, tone delight, still speaking little whisper. 'I cannot think got here, though.' 'My grandmother sent her thread.' 'I do not know mean,' said Curdie; 'but you are there, does not much matter.' 'Oh, yes, does!' returned Irene. 'I never her.' 'You tell get out, then. There is time lose now,'said Curdie. And Irene went work, fresh she began. 'There is lot stones!' she said. 'It take long time get away.' 'How far got?' asked Curdie. 'I have got half away, half ever much bigger.' 'I do not think move lower half. Do see slab laid wall?' Irene looked, felt her hands, soon perceived outlines slab. 'Yes,' she answered, 'I do.' 'Then, I think,' rejoined Curdie, 'when cleared slab half-way down, bit more, I shall able push over.' 'I must follow thread,' returned Irene, 'whatever I do.' 'What mean?' exclaimed Curdie. 'You see get out,' answered princess, went harder ever. But she soon satisfied Curdie wanted done thread wanted done one thing. For she saw following turns thread she clearing face slab, that, little half-way down, thread went chink slab wall place Curdie confined, she could follow farther slab her way. As soon she found this, she said right joyous whisper: 'Now, Curdie, I think give great push, slab would tumble over.' 'Stand quite clear it, then,' said Curdie, 'and let know ready.' Irene got heap, stood one side it. 'Now, Curdie!' she cried. Curdie gave great rush his shoulder it. Out tumbled slab heap, crept Curdie top it. 'You have saved life, Irene!' he whispered. 'Oh, Curdie! I am glad! Let us get horrid place fast can.' 'That is easier said done,' returned he. 'Oh, no, it is quite easy,' said Irene. 'We follow thread. I sure it is going take us now.' She already begun follow fallen slab hole, Curdie searching floor cavern his pickaxe. 'Here is!' he cried. 'No, not,' he added, disappointed tone. 'What be, then? I declare it is torch. That jolly! It is better almost pickaxe. Much better were not stone shoes!' he went on, he lighted torch blowing last embers expiring fire. When he looked up, lighted torch casting glare great darkness huge cavern, he caught sight Irene disappearing hole he come. 'Where going there?' he cried. 'That is way out. That is I could not get out.' 'I know that,' whispered Irene. 'But way thread goes, I must follow it.' 'What nonsense child talks!' said Curdie himself. 'I must follow her, though, see she comes harm. She soon find she cannot get way, she come me.' So he crept slab hole his torch his hand. But he looked it, he could see her nowhere. And he discovered although hole narrow, much longer he supposed; one direction roof came low, hole went narrow passage, he could see end. The princess must crept there. He got his knees one hand, holding torch other, crept her. The hole twisted about, parts low he could hardly get through, others high he could see roof, everywhere narrow--far narrow goblin get through, I presume never thought Curdie might. He beginning feel uncomfortable lest something befallen princess, he heard her voice almost close his ear, whispering: 'Are not coming, Curdie?' And he turned next corner she stood waiting him. 'I knew could not go wrong narrow hole, must keep me, great wide place,' she said. 'I cannot understand it,' said Curdie, half himself, half Irene. 'Never mind,' she returned. 'Wait till get out.' Curdie, utterly astonished she already got far, path he known nothing of, thought better let her she pleased. 'At events,' he said himself, 'I know nothing way, miner I am; she seems think she know something it, though she passes comprehension. So she is likely find her way I am, she insists taking lead, I must follow. We cannot much worse are, anyhow.' Reasoning thus, he followed her steps, came another great cavern, across Irene walked straight line, confidently she knew every step way. Curdie went her, flashing his torch about, trying see something lay around them. Suddenly he started back pace light fell upon something close Irene passing. It platform rock raised feet floor covered sheepskins, upon lay two horrible figures asleep, recognized Curdie king queen goblins. He lowered his torch instantly lest light awake them. As he flashed upon his pickaxe, lying side queen, whose hand lay close handle it. 'Stop one moment,' he whispered. 'Hold torch, do not let light faces.' Irene shuddered she saw frightful creatures, she passed without observing them, she he requested, turning her back, held torch low front her. Curdie drew his pickaxe carefully away, he spied one her feet, projecting skins. The great clumsy granite shoe, exposed thus his hand, temptation resisted. He laid hold it, and, cautious efforts, drew off. The moment he succeeded, he saw his astonishment he sung ignorance, annoy queen, actually true: she six horrible toes. Overjoyed his success, seeing huge bump sheepskins foot was, he proceeded lift gently, for, he could succeed carrying away shoe well, he would afraid goblins many flies. But he pulled second shoe queen gave growl sat bed. The instant king awoke also sat beside her. 'Run, Irene!' cried Curdie, though he least afraid himself, he princess. Irene looked round, saw fearful creatures awake, like wise princess she was, dashed torch ground extinguished it, crying out: 'Here, Curdie, take hand.' He darted her side, forgetting neither queen's shoe his pickaxe, caught hold her hand, she sped fearlessly her thread guided her. They heard queen give great bellow; good start, would time could get torches lighted pursue them. Just thought saw gleam behind them, thread brought narrow opening, Irene crept easily, Curdie difficulty. 'Now,'said Curdie; 'I think shall safe.' 'Of course shall,' returned Irene. 'Why think so?'asked Curdie. 'Because grandmother taking care us.' 'That is nonsense,' said Curdie. 'I do not know mean.' 'Then do not know I mean, right call nonsense?' asked princess, little offended. 'I beg pardon, Irene,' said Curdie; 'I mean vex you.' 'Of course not,' returned princess. 'But think shall safe?' 'Because king queen far stout get hole.' 'There might ways round,' said princess. 'To sure might: yet,' acknowledged Curdie. 'But mean king queen?' asked princess. 'I never call creatures king queen.' 'Their people do, though,' answered Curdie. The princess asked questions, Curdie, walked leisurely along, gave her full account, character habits goblins, far he knew them, his adventures them, beginning night he met her Lootie upon mountain. When he finished, he begged Irene tell she come his rescue. So Irene tell long story, she rather roundabout manner, interrupted many questions concerning things she explained. But her tale, he believe half it, left everything unaccountable before, he nearly much perplexed he must think princess. He could believe she deliberately telling stories, conclusion he could come Lootie playing child tricks, inventing end lies frighten her her purposes. 'But ever Lootie come let go mountains alone?'he asked. 'Lootie knows nothing it. I left her fast asleep--at least I think so. I hope grandmother will not let her get trouble, was not her fault all, grandmother well knows.' 'But find way me?' persisted Curdie. 'I told already,' answered Irene; 'by keeping finger upon grandmother's thread, I now.' 'You do not mean you have got thread there?' 'Of course I do. I told ten times already. I hardly--except I removing stones--taken finger it. There!' she added, guiding Curdie's hand thread, 'you feel yourself--do not you?' 'I feel nothing all,' replied Curdie. 'Then matter finger? I feel perfectly. To sure thin, sunlight looks like thread spider, though many twisted together make it--but I cannot think should not feel well I do.' Curdie polite say he believe thread all. What he say was: 'Well, I make nothing it.' 'I can, though, must glad that, us.' 'We are yet,' said Curdie. 'We soon shall be,' returned Irene confidently. And thread went downwards, led Irene's hand hole floor cavern, whence came sound running water hearing time. 'It goes ground now, Curdie,' she said, stopping. He listening another sound, his practised ear caught long ago, also growing louder. It noise goblin-miners made work, seemed great distance now. Irene heard moment she stopped. 'What noise?' she asked. 'Do know, Curdie?' 'Yes. It goblins digging burrowing,' he answered. 'And do not know for?' 'No; I have not least idea. Would like see them?' he asked, wishing another try secret. 'If thread took there, I should not much mind; I do not want see them, I cannot leave thread. It leads hole, better go once.' 'Very well. Shall I go first?' said Curdie. 'No; better not. You cannot feel thread,' she answered, stepping narrow break floor cavern. 'Oh!' she cried, 'I water. It running strong--but deep, room walk. Make haste, Curdie.' He tried, hole small get in. 'Go little bit he said, shouldering his pickaxe. In moments he cleared larger opening followed her. They went on, running water, Curdie getting afraid leading terrible gulf heart mountain. In one two places he break away rock make room even Irene could get through--at least without hurting herself. But length spied glimmer light, minute almost blinded full sunlight, emerged. It little time princess could see well enough discover stood her garden, close seat she her king-papa sat afternoon. They come channel little stream. She danced clapped her hands delight. 'Now, Curdie!' she cried, 'will not believe I told grandmother her thread?' For she felt time Curdie believing she told him. 'There!--do not see shining us?' she added. 'I do not see anything,' persisted Curdie. 'Then must believe without seeing,' said princess; 'for cannot deny brought us mountain.' 'I cannot deny mountain, I ungrateful indeed deny brought it.' 'I could not done thread,' persisted Irene. 'That is part I do not understand.' 'Well, come along, Lootie get something eat. I sure must want much.' 'Indeed I do. But father mother anxious me, I must make haste--first mountain tell mother, mine let father know.' 'Very well, Curdie; cannot get without coming way, I take house, nearest.' They met one way, for, indeed, before, people everywhere searching princess. When got Irene found thread, she half expected, went old staircase, new thought struck her. She turned Curdie said: 'My grandmother wants me. Do come see her. Then know I telling truth. Do come--to please me, Curdie. I cannot bear think I say true.' 'I never doubted believed said,' returned Curdie. 'I thought fancy head correct.' 'But come, dear Curdie.' The little miner could withstand appeal, though he felt shy seemed huge grand house, he yielded, followed her stair. CHAPTER 22 The Old Lady Curdie Up stair went, next next, long rows empty rooms, little tower stair, Irene growing happier happier she ascended. There answer she knocked length door workroom, could she hear sound spinning-wheel, her heart sank within her, one moment, she turned knocked door. 'Come in,' answered sweet voice her grandmother, Irene opened door entered, followed Curdie. 'You darling!' cried lady, seated fire red roses mingled white. 'I have waiting you, indeed getting little anxious you, beginning think whether I better go fetch myself.' As she spoke she took little princess her arms placed her upon her lap. She dressed white now, looking possible lovely ever. 'I have brought Curdie, grandmother. He would not believe I told I have brought him.' 'Yes--I see him. He good boy, Curdie, brave boy. Are not glad you have got out?' 'Yes, grandmother. But was not good believe I telling truth.' 'People must believe can, believe must hard upon believe less. I doubt would believed had not seen it.' 'Ah! yes, grandmother, I dare say. I am sure right. But he will believe now.' 'I do not know that,' replied her grandmother. 'Will not you, Curdie?' said Irene, looking round she asked question. He standing middle floor, staring, looking strangely bewildered. This she thought came his astonishment beauty lady. 'Make bow grandmother, Curdie,' she said. 'I do not see grandmother,' answered Curdie rather gruffly. 'Do not see grandmother, I am sitting her lap?' exclaimed princess. 'No, I do not,' reiterated Curdie, offended tone. 'Do not see lovely fire roses--white ones amongst time?' asked Irene, almost bewildered he. 'No, I do not,' answered Curdie, almost sulkily. 'Nor blue bed? Nor rose-coloured counterpane?--Nor beautiful light, like moon, hanging roof?' 'You are making game me, Your Royal Highness; come together day, I do not think kind you,' said Curdie, feeling much hurt. 'Then see?' asked Irene, perceived her believe least bad believe her. 'I see big, bare, garret-room--like one mother's cottage, big enough take cottage in, leave good margin round,' answered Curdie. 'And see?' 'I see tub, heap musty straw, withered apple, ray sunlight coming hole middle roof shining head, making place look curious dusky brown. I think better drop it, princess, go nursery, like good girl.' 'But do not hear grandmother talking me?' asked Irene, almost crying. 'No. I hear cooing lot pigeons. If will not come down, I go without you. I think better anyhow, I am sure nobody met us would believe word said them. They would think made up. I do not expect anybody father mother believe me. They know I would not tell story.' 'And yet will not believe me, Curdie?' expostulated princess, fairly crying vexation sorrow gulf her Curdie. 'No. I cannot, I cannot help it,' said Curdie, turning leave room. 'What SHALL I do, grandmother?' sobbed princess, turning her face round upon lady's bosom, shaking suppressed sobs. 'You must give time,' said her grandmother; 'and must content believed while. It hard bear; I bear it, shall bear many time yet. I take care Curdie thinks end. You must let go now.' 'You are coming, you?' asked Curdie. 'No, Curdie; grandmother says I must let go. Turn right get bottom stairs, take hall great door is.' 'Oh! I do not doubt I find way--without you, princess, old grannie's thread either,' said Curdie quite rudely. 'Oh, Curdie! Curdie!' 'I wish I gone home once. I am much obliged you, Irene, getting hole, I wish had not made fool afterwards.' He said he opened door, he left open, and, without another word, went stair. Irene listened dismay his departing footsteps. Then turning lady: 'What mean, grandmother?' she sobbed, burst fresh tears. 'It means, love, I mean show myself. Curdie yet able believe things. Seeing believing--it seeing. You remember I told Lootie see me, she would rub her eyes, forget half she saw, call half nonsense.' 'Yes; I thought Curdie--' 'You right. Curdie much farther Lootie, see come it. But meantime must content, I say, misunderstood while. We anxious understood, hard be. But one thing much necessary.' 'What that, grandmother?' 'To understand people.' 'Yes, grandmother. I must fair--for I am fair people, I am worth understood myself. I see. So Curdie cannot help it, I vexed him, wait.' 'There is dear child,' said her grandmother, pressed her close her bosom. 'Why were not workroom came up, grandmother?' asked Irene, moments' silence. 'If I there, Curdie would seen well enough. But I rather beautiful room?' 'I thought would spinning.' 'I have nobody spin present. I never spin without knowing I spinning.' 'That reminds me--there one thing puzzles me,' said princess: 'how get thread mountain again? Surely will not make another me? That would trouble!' The lady set her rose went fire. Putting her hand, she drew held shining ball her finger thumb. 'I have got now, see,' she said, coming back princess,  ready want it.' Going her cabinet, she laid drawer before. 'And ring,' she added, taking little finger her left hand putting forefinger Irene's right hand. 'Oh, thank you, grandmother! I feel safe now!' 'You tired, child,' lady went on. 'Your hands hurt stones, I counted nine bruises you. Just look like.' And she held her little mirror she brought cabinet. The princess burst merry laugh sight. She draggled stream dirty creeping narrow places, she seen reflection without knowing reflection, she would taken herself gipsy child whose face washed hair combed month. The lady laughed too, lifting her upon her knee, took her cloak night-gown. Then she carried her side room. Irene wondered she going her, asked questions--only starting little she found she going lay her large silver bath; she looked it, she saw bottom, stars shining miles away, seemed, great blue gulf. Her hands closed involuntarily beautiful arms held her, all. The lady pressed her her bosom, saying: 'Do afraid, child.' 'No, grandmother,' answered princess, little gasp; next instant she sank clear cool water. When she opened her eyes, she saw nothing strange lovely blue beneath her. The lady, beautiful room, vanished her sight, she seemed utterly alone. But instead afraid, she felt happy--perfectly blissful. And somewhere came voice lady, singing strange sweet song, she could distinguish every word; sense she feeling--no understanding. Nor could she remember single line gone. It vanished, like poetry dream, fast came. In years, however, she would sometimes fancy snatches melody suddenly rising her brain must little phrases fragments air song; fancy would make her happier, abler her duty. How long she lay water she know. It seemed long time--not weariness pleasure. But last she felt beautiful hands lay hold her, gurgling water she lifted lovely room. The lady carried her fire, sat her her lap, dried her tenderly softest towel. It different Lootie's drying. When lady done, she stooped fire, drew her night-gown, white snow. 'How delicious!' exclaimed princess. 'It smells roses world, I think.' When she stood floor she felt she made again. Every bruise weariness gone, her hands soft whole ever. 'Now I going put bed good sleep,' said her grandmother. 'But Lootie thinking? And I say her she asks I been?' 'Do not trouble it. You find come right,' said her grandmother, laid her blue bed, rosy counterpane. 'There one thing more,' said Irene. 'I little anxious Curdie. As I brought house, I ought seen safe his way home.' 'I took care that,' answered lady. 'I told let go, therefore I bound look him. Nobody saw him, he eating good dinner his mother's cottage far mountain.' 'Then I go sleep,' said Irene, minutes she fast asleep. CHAPTER 23 Curdie His Mother Curdie went mountain neither whistling singing, he vexed Irene taking in, he called it; he vexed spoken her angrily. His mother gave cry joy she saw him, set getting something eat, asking questions time, he answer cheerfully usual. When his meal ready, she left eat it, hurried mine let his father know he safe. When she came back, she found fast asleep upon her bed; he wake his father came home evening. 'Now, Curdie,' his mother said, sat supper, 'tell us whole story beginning end, happened.' Curdie obeyed, told everything point came upon lawn garden king's house. 'And happened that?' asked his mother. 'You have not told us all. You ought happy got away demons, instead I never saw gloomy. There must something more. Besides, speak lovely child I like hear you. She saved life risk her own, yet somehow do not seem think much it.' 'She talked nonsense' answered Curdie, 'and told pack things were not bit true; I cannot get it.' 'What they?' asked his father. 'Your mother may able throw light upon them.' Then Curdie made clean breast it, told everything. They sat silent time, pondering strange tale. At last Curdie's mother spoke. 'You confess, boy,' she said, 'there something whole affair understand?' 'Yes, course, mother,' he answered. 'I cannot understand child knowing nothing mountain, even I shut it, come way alone, straight I was; then, getting hole, lead mountain too, I known step way light open air.' 'Then right say she told true. She take out, she must something guide her: thread well rope, anything else? There something cannot explain, her explanation may right one.' 'It is explanation all, mother; I cannot believe it.' 'That may understand it. If did, would probably find explanation, believe thoroughly. I do not blame able believe it, I blame fancying child would try deceive you. Why she? Depend upon it, she told she knew. Until found better way accounting all, might least sparing judgement.' 'That something inside saying time,' said Curdie, hanging his head. 'But make grandmother? That I cannot get over. To take old garret, try persuade sight eyes beautiful room, blue walls silver stars, end things it, nothing old tub withered apple heap straw sunbeam! It bad! She might old woman least pass her precious grandmother!' 'Did not she speak she saw things herself, Curdie?' 'Yes. That is bothers me. You would thought she really meant believed she saw every one things she talked about. And one there! It bad, I say.' 'Perhaps people see things people cannot see, Curdie,' said his mother gravely. 'I think I tell something I saw once--only Perhaps You will not believe either!' 'Oh, mother, mother!' cried Curdie, bursting tears; 'I do not deserve that, surely!' 'But I going tell strange,' persisted his mother; 'and heard say I must dreaming, I do not know I right vexed you, though I know least I asleep.' 'Do tell me, mother. Perhaps help think better princess.' 'That is I tempted tell you,' replied his mother. 'But first, I may well mention that, according old whispers, something common king's family; queen blood, cousins degree. There strange stories told concerning them--all good stories--but strange, strange. What I cannot tell, I remember faces grandmother mother talked together them. There wonder awe--not fear--in eyes, whispered, never spoke aloud. But I saw this: Your father going work mine one night, I his supper. It soon married, long born. He came mouth mine, left go home alone, I knew way almost well floor cottage. It pretty dark, parts road rocks overhung nearly quite dark. But I got along perfectly well, never thinking afraid, I reached spot know well enough, Curdie, path make sharp turn way great rock left-hand side. When I got there, I suddenly surrounded half dozen cobs, first I ever seen, although I heard tell often enough. One blocked path, began tormenting teasing way makes shudder think even now.' 'If I you!' cried father son breath. The mother gave funny little smile, went on. 'They horrible creatures too, I must confess I dreadfully frightened. They torn clothes much, I afraid going tear pieces, suddenly great white soft light shone upon me. I looked up. A broad ray, like shining road, came large globe silvery light, high up, indeed quite high horizon--so could new star another moon anything sort. The cobs dropped persecuting me, looked dazed, I thought going run away, presently began again. The moment, however, path globe light came bird, shining like silver sun. It gave rapid flaps first, then, wings straight out, shot, sliding slope light. It looked like white pigeon. But whatever was, cobs caught sight coming straight upon them, took heels scampered away across mountain, leaving safe, much frightened. As soon sent off, bird went gliding light, moment reached globe light disappeared, shutter closed window, I saw More. But I trouble cobs night ever after.' 'How strange!' exclaimed Curdie. 'Yes, strange; I cannot help believing it, whether not,' said his mother. 'It is exactly mother told next morning,' said his father. 'You do not think I am doubting mother?' cried Curdie. 'There people world quite well worth believing mother,' said his mother. 'I do not know she is much fitter believed she happens mother, Mr. Curdie. There mothers far likely tell lies little girl I saw talking primroses weeks ago. If she lie I begin doubt word.' 'But princesses told lies well people,' said Curdie. 'Yes, princesses like child. She is good girl, I certain, that is princess. Depend upon sorry behaving her, Curdie. You ought least held tongue.' 'I sorry now,' answered Curdie. 'You ought go tell her so, then.' 'I do not see I could manage that. They would not let miner boy like word her alone; I could not tell her nurse hers. She would asking ever many questions, I do not know many little princess would like answer. She told Lootie did not know anything her coming get mountain. I certain she would prevented her somehow she known it. But I may chance long, meantime I must try something her. I think, father, I got track last.' 'Have you, indeed, boy?' said Peter. 'I sure deserve success; worked hard it. What found out?' 'It is difficult, know, father, inside mountain, especially dark, knowing turns taken, tell lie things outside.' 'Impossible, boy, without chart, least compass,' returned his father. 'Well, I think I nearly discovered direction cobs mining. If I right, I know something else I put it, one one make three.' 'They often do, Curdie, miners ought well aware. Now tell us, boy, two things are, see whether guess third you.' 'I do not see princess,' interposed his mother. 'I soon let see that, mother. Perhaps may think foolish, I sure there, nothing present fancy, I determined ever go observations. Just came channel got out, I heard miners work somewhere near--I think us. Now since I began watch them, mined good half-mile, straight line; far I aware, working part mountain. But I never could tell direction going. When came king's garden, however, I thought whether possible working towards king's house; I want tonight make sure whether not. I take light me--' 'Oh, Curdie,' cried his mother, 'then see you.' 'I am afraid I before,' rejoined Curdie, 'now I have got precious shoe. They cannot make another hurry, one bare foot purpose. Woman she may be, I will not spare her next time. But I shall careful light, I do not want see me. I will not stick hat.' 'Go on, then, tell us mean do.' 'I mean take bit paper pencil, go mouth stream came out. I shall mark paper near I angle every turning I take I find cobs work, get good idea direction going. If prove nearly parallel stream, I shall know towards king's house working.' 'And should? How much wiser then?' 'Wait minute, mother dear. I told I came upon royal family cave, talking prince--Harelip, called him--marrying sun-woman--that means one us--one toes her feet. Now speech one made night great gathering, I heard part, he said peace would secured generation least pledge prince would hold good behaviour her relatives: that is he said, he must meant sun-woman prince marry. I quite sure king much proud wish his son marry princess, much knowing fancy his peasant woman wife would great advantage them.' 'I see driving now,' said his mother. 'But,' said his father, 'our king would dig mountain plain he would his princess wife cob, he ten times prince.' 'Yes; think much themselves!' said his mother. 'Small creatures always do. The bantam proudest cock little yard.' 'And I fancy,' said Curdie, 'if got her, would tell king would kill her except he consented marriage.' 'They might say so,' said his father, 'but would not kill her; would keep her alive sake hold gave king. Whatever he them, would threaten princess.' 'And bad enough torment her amusement--I know that,' said his mother. 'Anyhow, I keep watch them, see to,' said Curdie. 'It is horrible think of. I dare not let it. But shall not her--at least I help it. So, mother dear--my clue right--will get bit paper pencil lump pease pudding, I set once. I saw place I climb wall garden quite easily.' 'You must mind keep way men watch,' said his mother. 'That I will. I do not want know anything it. They would spoil all. The cobs would try plan--they obstinate creatures! I shall take good care, mother. They will not kill eat either, come upon me. So need not mind them.' His mother got he asked for, Curdie set out. Close beside door princess left garden mountain stood great rock, climbing Curdie got wall. He tied his clue stone inside channel stream, took his pickaxe him. He gone far he encountered horrid creature coming towards mouth. The spot narrow two almost size shape, besides Curdie wish let creature pass. Not able use his pickaxe, however, he severe struggle him, receiving many bites, bad, he succeeded killing his pocket-knife. Having dragged out, he made haste get another stop way. I need follow farther night's adventures. He returned his breakfast, satisfied goblins mining direction palace--on low level intention must, he thought, burrow walls king's house, rise inside it--in order, he fully believed, lay hands little princess, carry her wife horrid Harelip. CHAPTER 24 Irene Behaves Like Princess When princess awoke sweetest sleeps, she found her nurse bending her, housekeeper looking nurse's shoulder, laundry-maid looking housekeeper's. The room full women-servants; gentlemen-at-arms, long column servants behind them, peeping, trying peep door nursery. 'Are horrid creatures gone?' asked princess, remembering first terrified her morning. 'You naughty, naughty little princess!' cried Lootie. Her face pale, red streaks it, she looked she going shake her; Irene said nothing--only waited hear come next. 'How could get clothes like that, make us fancy lost! And keep day too! You obstinate child! It is anything fun us, I tell you!' It way nurse could account her disappearance. 'I did not that, Lootie,' said Irene, quietly. 'Do not tell stories!' cried her nurse quite rudely. 'I shall tell nothing all,' said Irene. 'That is bad,' said nurse. 'Just bad say nothing tell stories?' exclaimed princess. 'I ask papa that. He will not say so. And I do not think he like say so.' 'Tell directly mean it!' screamed nurse, half wild anger princess fright possible consequences herself. 'When I tell truth, Lootie,' said princess, somehow feel angry, 'you say "Do not tell stories": seems I must tell stories believe me.' 'You rude, princess,' said nurse. 'You rude, Lootie, I speak till sorry. Why I, I know believe me?' returned princess. For she know perfectly well she tell Lootie she about, she went tell her, less would she believe her. 'You provoking child!' cried her nurse. 'You deserve well punished wicked behaviour.' 'Please, Mrs Housekeeper,' said princess, 'will take room, keep till king-papa comes? I ask come soon he can.' Every one stared words. Up moment regarded her little baby. But housekeeper afraid nurse, sought patch matters up, saying: 'I sure, princess, nursie mean rude you.' 'I think papa would wish nurse spoke Lootie does. If she thinks I tell lies, she better either say papa, go away. Sir Walter, take charge me?' 'With greatest pleasure, princess,' answered captain gentlemen-at-arms, walking his great stride room. The crowd servants made eager way him, he bowed low little princess's bed. 'I shall send servant once, fastest horse stable, tell king-papa Your Royal Highness desires his presence. When chosen one under-servants wait upon you, I shall order room cleared.' 'Thank much, Sir Walter,' said princess, her eye glanced towards rosy-cheeked girl lately come house scullery-maid. But Lootie saw eyes her dear princess going search another instead her, she fell upon her knees bedside, burst great cry distress. 'I think, Sir Walter,' said princess, 'I keep Lootie. But I put care; need trouble king-papa I speak again. Will please go away? I quite safe well, I hide sake either amusing myself, troubling people. Lootie, please dress me.' CHAPTER 25 Curdie Comes Grief Everything time quiet ground. The king still away distant part his dominions. The men-at-arms kept watching house. They considerably astonished finding foot rock garden hideous body goblin creature killed Curdie; came conclusion slain mines, crept die; except occasional glimpse live one saw nothing alarm. Curdie kept watching mountain, goblins kept burrowing deeper earth. As long went deeper was, Curdie judged, immediate danger. To Irene summer full pleasure ever, long time, although she often thought her grandmother day, often dreamed her night, she see her. The kids flowers much her delight ever, she made much friendship miners' children she met mountain Lootie would permit; Lootie foolish notions concerning dignity princess, understanding truest princess one loves her brothers sisters best, able good humble towards them. At time she considerably altered better her behaviour princess. She could help seeing she longer mere child, wiser her age would account for. She kept foolishly whispering servants, however--sometimes princess right her mind, sometimes she good live, nonsense sort. All time Curdie sorry, without chance confessing, he behaved unkindly princess. This perhaps made diligent his endeavours serve her. His mother he often talked subject, she comforted him, told she sure he would day opportunity he much desired. Here I like remark, sake princes princesses general, low contemptible thing refuse confess fault, even error. If true princess done wrong, she always uneasy she opportunity throwing wrongness away her saying: 'I it; I wish I not; I sorry done it.' So see ground supposing Curdie miner only, prince well. Many instances known world's history. At length, however, he began see signs change proceedings goblin excavators: going deeper, commenced running level; he watched them, therefore, closely ever. All once, one night, coming slope hard rock, began ascend along inclined plane surface. Having reached top, went level night two, began ascend more, kept pretty steep angle. At length Curdie judged time transfer his observation another quarter, next night he go mine all; but, leaving his pickaxe clue home, taking his usual lumps bread pease pudding, went mountain king's house. He climbed wall, remained garden whole night, creeping hands knees one spot other, lying full length his ear ground, listening. But he heard nothing except tread men-at-arms marched about, whose observation, night cloudy moon, he little difficulty avoiding. For several following nights he continued haunt garden listen, success. At length, early one evening, whether he got careless his safety, growing moon become strong enough expose him, his watching came sudden end. He creeping behind rock stream ran out, he listening round hope might convey his ear indication whereabouts goblin miners, he came moonlight lawn, whizz his ear blow upon his leg startled him. He instantly squatted hope eluding notice. But he heard sound running feet, he jumped take chance escape flight. He fell, however, keen shoot pain, bolt crossbow wounded his leg, blood streaming it. He instantly laid Hold two three men-at-arms. It useless struggle, he submitted silence. 'It is boy!' cried several together, tone amazement. 'I thought one demons. What here?' 'Going little rough usage, apparently,' said Curdie, laughing, men shook him. 'Impertinence good. You business king's grounds, do not give true account yourself, shall fare thief.' 'Why, else could he be?' said one. 'He might lost kid, know,' suggested another. 'I see good trying excuse him. He business here, anyhow.' 'Let go away, then, please,' said Curdie. 'But do not please--not except give good account yourself.' 'I do not feel quite sure whether I trust you,' said Curdie. 'We king's men-at-arms,' said captain courteously, he taken Curdie's appearance courage. 'Well, I tell it--if promise listen anything rash.' 'I call cool!' said one party, laughing. 'He tell us mischief he about, promise pleases him.' 'I mischief,' said Curdie. But ere he could say he turned faint, fell senseless grass. Then first discovered bolt shot, taking one goblin creatures, wounded him. They carried house laid hall. The report spread caught robber, servants crowded see villain. Amongst rest came nurse. The moment she saw she exclaimed indignation: 'I declare it is young rascal miner rude princess mountain. He actually wanted kiss princess. I took good care that--the wretch! And he prowling about, he? Just like his impudence!' The princess fast asleep, she could misrepresent her pleasure. When he heard this, captain, although he considerable doubt truth, resolved keep Curdie prisoner could search affair. So, brought round little, attended his wound, rather bad one, laid him, still exhausted loss blood, upon mattress disused room--one already often mentioned--and locked door, left him. He passed troubled night, morning found talking wildly. In evening he came himself, felt weak, his leg exceedingly painful. Wondering he was, seeing one men-at-arms room, he began question soon recalled events preceding night. As he unable watch more, he told soldier he knew goblins, begged tell his companions, stir watch tenfold vigilance; whether he talk quite coherently, whole thing appeared incredible, certainly man concluded Curdie raving still, tried coax holding his tongue. This, course, annoyed Curdie dreadfully, felt his turn believed, consequence his fever returned, time when, his persistent entreaties, captain called, could doubt he raving. They could, promised everything he wanted, intention fulfilment. At last he went sleep, length his sleep grew profound peaceful, left him, locked door again, withdrew, intending revisit early morning. CHAPTER 26 The Goblin-Miners That night several servants chat together going bed. 'What noise be?' said one housemaids, listening moment two. 'I have heard last two nights,' said cook. 'If place, I taken rats, Tom keeps far enough.' 'I have heard, though,' said scullery-maid, 'that rats move great companies sometimes. There may army invading us. I have heard noises yesterday today too.' 'It will grand fun, then, Tom Mrs Housekeeper's Bob,' said cook. 'They will friends lives, fight side. I will engage Tom Bob together put flight number rats.' 'It seems me,' said nurse, 'that noises much loud that. I heard day, princess asked several times could be. Sometimes sound like distant thunder, sometimes like noises hear mountain horrid miners underneath.' 'I should not wonder,' said cook, 'if miners all. They may come hole mountain noises reach us. They always boring blasting breaking, know.' As he spoke, came great rolling rumble beneath them, house quivered. They started affright, rushing hall found gentlemen-at-arms consternation also. They sent wake captain, said description must earthquake, occurrence which, although rare country, taken place almost within century; went bed again, strange say, fell fast asleep without thinking Curdie, associating noises heard he told them. He believed Curdie. If he had, he would thought he said, would taken precautions. As heard nothing more, concluded Sir Walter right, danger perhaps another hundred years. The fact, discovered afterwards, goblins had, working second sloping face stone, arrived huge block lay cellars house, within line foundations. It round succeeded, hard work, dislodging without blasting, rolled thundering slope bounding, jarring roll, shook foundations house. The goblins dismayed noise, knew, careful spying measuring, must near, king's house, feared giving alarm. They, therefore, remained quiet while, began work again, doubt thought fortunate coming upon vein sand filled winding fissure rock house built. By scooping away came king's wine cellar. No sooner find were, scurried back again, like rats holes, running full speed goblin palace, announced success king queen shouts triumph. In moment goblin royal family whole goblin people way hot haste king's house, eager share glory carrying night Princess Irene. The queen went stumping along one shoe stone one skin. This could pleasant, readers may wonder that, skilful workmen her, she yet replaced shoe carried Curdie. As king, however, one ground objection her stone shoes, he doubt took advantage discovery her toes, threatened expose her deformity she another made. I presume he insisted her content skin shoes, allowed her wear remaining granite one present occasion she going war. They soon arrived king's wine cellar, regardless huge vessels, know use, proceeded once, quietly could, force door led upwards. CHAPTER 27 The Goblins King's House When Curdie fell asleep he began dream. He thought he ascending Mountainside mouth mine, whistling singing 'Ring, dod, bang!' he came upon woman child lost way; point he went dreaming everything happened since he thus met princess Lootie; he watched goblins, he taken them, he rescued princess; everything, indeed, he wounded, captured, imprisoned men-at-arms. And he thought he lying wide awake laid him, suddenly he heard great thundering sound. 'The cobs coming!' he said. 'They did not believe word I told them! The cobs'll carrying princess stupid noses! But shall not! shall not!' He jumped up, he thought, began dress, but, his dismay, found he still lying bed. 'Now then, I will!' he said. 'Here goes! I now!' But yet he found snug bed. Twenty times he tried, twenty times he failed; fact he awake, dreaming he was. At length agony despair, fancying he heard goblins house, he gave great cry. Then came, he thought, hand upon lock his door. It opened, and, looking up, he saw lady white hair, carrying silver box her hand, enter room. She came his bed, he thought, stroked his head face cool, soft hands, took dressing his leg, rubbed something smelt like roses, waved her hands three times. At last wave her hands everything vanished, he felt sinking profoundest slumber, remembered nothing he awoke earnest. The setting moon throwing feeble light casement, house full uproar. There soft heavy multitudinous stamping, clashing clanging weapons, voices men cries women, mixed hideous bellowing, sounded victorious. The cobs house! He sprang his bed, hurried his clothes, forgetting his shoes, armed nails; spying old hunting-knife, short sword, hanging wall, he caught it, rushed stairs, guided sounds strife, grew louder louder. When he reached ground floor he found whole place swarming. All goblins mountain seemed gathered there. He rushed amongst them, shouting: 'One, two, Hit hew! Three, four, Blast bore!' every rhyme he came great stamp upon foot, cutting time faces--executing, indeed, sword dance wildest description. Away scattered goblins every direction--into closets, stairs, chimneys, rafters, cellars. Curdie went stamping slashing singing, saw nothing people house he came great hall, which, moment he entered it, arose great goblin shout. The last men-at-arms, captain himself, floor, buried beneath wallowing crowd goblins. For, knight busy defending well he could, stabs thick bodies goblins, he soon found heads invulnerable, queen attacked his legs feet her horrible granite shoe, he soon down; captain got his back wall stood longer. The goblins would torn pieces, king given orders carry away alive, them, twelve groups, standing knot goblins, many could find room sitting upon prostrate bodies. Curdie burst dancing gyrating stamping singing like small incarnate whirlwind. 'Where it is hole, sir, Never holes: Why shoes soles, sir, When they have got souls? 'But she upon her foot, sir, Has granite shoe: The strongest leather boot, sir, Six would soon through.' The queen gave howl rage dismay; she recovered her presence mind, Curdie, begun group nearest him, eleven knights legs again. 'Stamp feet!' he cried man rose, minutes hall nearly empty, goblins running fast could, howling shrieking limping, cowering every ran cuddle wounded feet hard hands, protect frightful stamp-stamp armed men. And Curdie approached group which, trusting queen her shoe, kept guard prostrate captain. The king sat captain's head, queen stood front, like infuriated cat, her perpendicular eyes gleaming green, her hair standing half her horrid head. Her heart quaking, however, she kept moving her skin-shod foot nervous apprehension. When Curdie within paces, she rushed him, made one tremendous stamp his opposing foot, happily he withdrew time, caught round waist, dash marble floor. But she caught him, he came weight his iron-shod shoe upon her skin-shod foot, hideous howl she dropped him, squatted floor, took her foot her hands. Meanwhile rest rushed king bodyguard, sent flying, lifted prostrate captain, pressed death. It moments he recovered breath consciousness. 'Where is princess?' cried Curdie, again. No one knew, rushed search her. Through every room house went, nowhere she found. Neither one servants seen. But Curdie, kept lower part house, quiet enough, began hear confused sound distant hubbub, set find came from. The noise grew his sharp ears guided stair wine cellar. It full goblins, butler supplying wine fast he could draw it. While queen her party encountered men-at-arms, Harelip another company gone search house. They captured every one met, could find more, hurried away carry safe caverns below. But butler, amongst them, found path lay wine cellar, he bethought persuading taste wine, and, he hoped, sooner tasted wanted more. The routed goblins, way below, joined them, Curdie entered all, outstretched hands, vessels every description sauce pan silver cup, pressing around butler, sat tap huge cask, filling filling. Curdie cast one glance around place commencing his attack, saw farthest corner terrified group domestics unwatched, cowering without courage attempt escape. Amongst terror-stricken face Lootie; nowhere could he see princess. Seized horrible conviction Harelip already carried her off, he rushed amongst them, unable wrath sing more, stamping cutting greater fury ever. 'Stamp feet; stamp feet!' he shouted, moment goblins disappearing hole floor like rats mice. They could vanish fast, however, many goblin feet go limping back underground ways mountain morning. Presently, however, reinforced king his party, redoubtable queen head. Finding Curdie busy amongst her unfortunate subjects, she rushed rage despair, time gave bad bruise foot. Then regular stamping fight got them, Curdie, point his hunting-knife, keeping her clasping her mighty arms him, he watched his opportunity getting good stamp her skin-shod foot. But queen wary well agile hitherto. The rest meantime, finding adversary thus matched moment, paused headlong hurry, turned shivering group women corner. As determined emulate his father sun-woman sort share his future throne, Harelip rushed them, caught Lootie, sped her hole. She gave great shriek, Curdie heard her, saw plight she in. Gathering his strength, he gave queen sudden cut across face his weapon, came down, she started back, his weight proper foot, sprung Lootie's rescue. The prince two defenceless feet, Curdie stamped he reached hole. He dropped his burden rolled shrieking earth. Curdie made one stab he disappeared, caught hold senseless Lootie, dragged her back corner, mounted guard her, preparing encounter queen. Her face streaming blood, her eyes flashing green lightning it, she came her mouth open her teeth grinning like tiger's, followed king her bodyguard thickest goblins. But moment rushed captain his men, ran stamping furiously. They dared encounter onset. Away scurried, queen foremost. Of course, right thing would take king queen prisoners, hold hostages princess, anxious find her one thought detaining late. Having thus rescued servants, set searching house more. None could give least information concerning princess. Lootie almost silly terror, and, although scarcely able walk would leave Curdie's side single moment. Again he allowed others search rest house--where, except dismayed goblin lurking there, found one--while he requested Lootie take princess's room. She submissive obedient he king. He found bedclothes tossed about, floor, princess's garments scattered room, greatest confusion. It evident goblins there, Curdie longer doubt she carried first inroad. With pang despair he saw wrong securing king queen prince; he determined find rescue princess she found rescued him, meet worst fate goblins could doom him. CHAPTER 28 Curdie's Guide Just consolation resolve dawned upon his mind he turning away cellar follow goblins hole, something touched his hand. It slightest touch, he looked he could see nothing. Feeling peering grey dawn, his fingers came upon tight thread. He looked again, narrowly, still could see nothing. It flashed upon must princess's thread. Without saying word, he knew one would believe he believed princess, he followed thread his finger, contrived give Lootie slip, soon house mountainside--surprised that, thread indeed grandmother's messenger, led princess, he supposed must, mountain, she would certain meet goblins rushing back enraged defeat. But he hurried hope overtaking her first. When he arrived, however, place path turned mine, he found thread turn it, went straight mountain. Could thread leading home his mother's cottage? Could princess there? He bounded mountain like one goats, sun thread brought indeed his mother's door. There vanished his fingers, he could find it, search he might. The door latch, he entered. There sat his mother fire, her arms lay princess, fast asleep. 'Hush, Curdie!' said his mother. 'Do wake her. I am glad you are come! I thought cobs must got again!' With heart full delight, Curdie sat corner hearth, stool opposite his mother's chair, gazed princess, slept peacefully she her bed. All she opened her eyes fixed him. 'Oh, Curdie! you are come!' she said quietly. 'I thought would!' Curdie rose stood her downcast eyes. 'Irene,' he said, 'I sorry I believe you.' 'Oh, never mind, Curdie!' answered princess. 'You could not, know. You believe now, do not you?' 'I cannot help now. I ought helped before.' 'Why cannot help now?' 'Because, I going mountain look you, I got hold thread, brought here.' 'Then you have come house, you?' 'Yes, I have.' 'I did not know there.' 'I have two three days, I believe.' 'And I never knew it! Then perhaps tell grandmother brought here? I cannot think. Something woke me--I did not know what, I frightened, I felt thread, was! I frightened still brought mountain, I thought going take again, I like outside best. I supposed trouble again, I get out. But brought instead; and, oh, Curdie! mother kind me--just like grandmother!' Here Curdie's mother gave princess hug, princess turned gave her sweet smile, held her mouth kiss her. 'Then did not see cobs?'asked Curdie. 'No; I have not mountain, I told you, Curdie.' 'But cobs house--all it--and bedroom, making row!' 'What want there? It rude them.' 'They wanted you--to carry mountain them, wife prince Harelip.' 'Oh, dreadful' cried princess, shuddering. 'But need not afraid, know. Your grandmother takes care you.' 'Ah! believe grandmother, then? I am glad! She made think would day.' All Curdie remembered his dream, silent, thinking. 'But come house, know it?' asked princess. Then Curdie explain everything--how he watched her sake, he wounded shut soldiers, he heard noises could rise, beautiful old lady come him, followed. 'Poor Curdie! lie hurt ill, never know it!' exclaimed princess, stroking his rough hand. 'I would come nursed you, told me.' 'I did not see lame,' said his mother.  I, mother? Oh--yes--I suppose I ought be! I declare I have never thought since I got go amongst cobs!' 'Let see wound,' said his mother. He pulled his stocking--when behold, except great scar, his leg perfectly sound! Curdie his mother gazed other's eyes, full wonder, Irene called out: 'I thought so, Curdie! I sure was not dream. I sure grandmother see you. Do not smell roses? It grandmother healed leg, sent help me.' 'No, Princess Irene,' said Curdie; 'I was not good enough allowed help you: I did not believe you. Your grandmother took care without me.' 'She sent help people, anyhow. I wish king-papa would come. I want tell good been!' 'But,' said mother, 'we forgetting frightened people must be. You must take princess home once, Curdie--or least go tell she is.' 'Yes, mother. Only I am dreadfully hungry. Do let breakfast first. They ought listened me, would not taken surprise were.' 'That true, Curdie; blame much. You remember?' 'Yes, mother, I do. Only I must really something eat.' 'You shall, boy--as fast I get it,' said his mother, rising setting princess her chair. But his breakfast ready, Curdie jumped suddenly startle his companions. 'Mother, mother!' he cried, 'I forgetting. You must take princess home yourself. I must go wake father.' Without word explanation, he rushed place his father sleeping. Having thoroughly roused he told he darted cottage. CHAPTER 29 Masonwork He remembered resolution goblins carry second plan upon failure first. No doubt already busy, mine therefore greatest danger flooded rendered useless--not speak lives miners. When he reached mouth mine, rousing miners within reach, he found his father good many entering. They hurried gang he found way goblin country. There foresight Peter already collected great many blocks stone, cement, ready building weak place--well enough known goblins. Although room two actually building once, managed, setting rest work preparing cement passing stones, finish course day huge buttress filling whole gang, supported everywhere live rock. Before hour usually dropped work, satisfied mine secure. They heard goblin hammers pickaxes busy time, length fancied heard sounds water never heard before. But otherwise accounted left mine, stepped tremendous storm raging mountain. The thunder bellowing, lightning lancing huge black cloud lay hung edges thick mist sides. The lightning breaking mountain, too, flashing cloud. From state brooks, swollen raging torrents, evident storm storming day. The wind blowing would blow mountain, but, anxious his mother princess, Curdie darted thick tempest. Even set storm came on, he judge safe, storm even poor little house danger. Indeed he soon found huge rock built, protected blasts waters, must swept blown away; two torrents rock parted rush water behind united front cottage--two roaring dangerous streams, his mother princess could possibly passed. It great difficulty he forced his way one them, door. The moment his hand fell latch, uproar winds Waters came joyous cry princess: 'There is Curdie! Curdie! Curdie!' She sitting wrapped blankets bed, his mother trying hundredth time light fire drowned rain came chimney. The clay floor one mass mud, whole place looked wretched. But faces mother princess shone troubles made merrier. Curdie burst laughing sight them. 'I never fun!' said princess, her eyes twinkling her pretty teeth shining. 'How nice must live cottage mountain!' 'It depends kind inside house is,' said mother. 'I know mean,' said Irene. 'That is kind thing grandmother says.' By time Peter returned storm nearly over, streams fierce swollen question princess go mountain, dangerous Peter even Curdie make attempt gathering darkness. 'They dreadfully frightened you,' said Peter princess, 'but cannot help it. We must wait till morning.' With Curdie's help, fire lighted last, mother set making supper; supper told princess stories till she grew sleepy. Then Curdie's mother laid her Curdie's bed, tiny little garret-room. As soon she bed, little window low roof she caught sight her grandmother's lamp shining far away beneath, she gazed beautiful silvery globe she fell asleep. CHAPTER 30 The King Kiss The next morning sun rose bright Irene said rain washed his face let light clean. The torrents still roaring side mountain, much smaller dangerous daylight. After early breakfast, Peter went his work Curdie his mother set take princess home. They difficulty getting her dry across streams, Curdie carry her, last got safe broader part road, walked gently towards king's house. And see turned last corner last king's troop riding gate! 'Oh, Curdie!' cried Irene, clapping her hands right joyfully,'my king-papa come.' The moment Curdie heard that, he caught her his arms, set full speed, crying: 'Come on, mother dear! The king may break his heart he knows she safe.' Irene clung round his neck he ran her like deer. When he entered gate court, sat king his horse, people house him, weeping hanging heads. The king weeping, his face white dead man's, he looked life gone him. The men-at-arms he brought sat horror-stricken faces, eyes flashing rage, waiting word king something--they know what, nobody knew what. The day before, men-at-arms belonging house, soon satisfied princess carried away, rushed goblins hole, found already skilfully blockaded narrowest part, many feet cellar, without miners tools could nothing. Not one knew mouth mine lay, set find overtaken storm even yet returned. Poor Sir Walter especially filled shame, almost hoped king would order his head cut off, think sweet little face amongst goblins unendurable. When Curdie ran gate princess his arms, absorbed misery awed king's presence grief, one observed his arrival. He went straight king, he sat his horse. 'Papa! papa!' princess cried, stretching her arms him; 'here I am!' The king started. The colour rushed his face. He gave inarticulate cry. Curdie held princess, king bent took her his arms. As he clasped her his bosom, big tears went dropping his cheeks his beard. And shout arose bystanders startled horses pranced capered, armour rang clattered, rocks mountain echoed back noises. The princess greeted she nestled her father's bosom, king set her she told story. But she tell Curdie herself, she tell herself none could understand--except king Curdie, stood king's knee stroking neck great white horse. And still she told Curdie done, Sir Walter others added she told, even Lootie joining praises his courage energy. Curdie held his peace, looking quietly king's face. And his mother stood outskirts crowd listening delight, her son's deeds pleasant her ears, princess caught sight her. 'And his mother, king-papa!' she said. 'See--there. She nice mother, kind me!' They parted asunder king made sign her come forward. She obeyed, he gave her his hand, could speak. 'And now, king-papa,' princess went on, 'I must tell another thing. One night long ago Curdie drove goblins away brought Lootie safe mountain. And I promised kiss got home, Lootie would not let give him. I do not want scold Lootie, I want tell her princess must she promises.' 'Indeed she must, child--except wrong,' said king. 'There, give Curdie kiss.' And he spoke he held her towards him. The princess reached down, threw her arms round Curdie's neck, kissed mouth, saying: 'There, Curdie! There is kiss I promised you!' Then went house, cook rushed kitchen servants work. Lootie dressed Irene her shiningest clothes, king put his armour, put purple gold; messenger sent Peter miners, great grand feast, continued long princess put bed. CHAPTER 31 The Subterranean Waters The king's harper, always formed part his escort, chanting ballad he made he went playing his instrument--about princess goblins, prowess Curdie, he ceased, his eyes one doors hall. Thereupon eyes king his guests turned thitherward also. The next moment, open doorway came princess Irene. She went straight her father, her right hand stretched little sideways, her forefinger, her father Curdie understood, feeling way along invisible thread. The king took her his knee, she said his ear: 'King-papa, hear noise?' 'I hear nothing,' said king. 'Listen,' she said, holding her forefinger. The king listened, great stillness fell upon company. Each man, seeing king listened, listened also, harper sat his harp his arms, his finger silent upon strings. 'I hear noise,' said king length--'a noise distant thunder. It coming nearer nearer. What be?' They heard now, seemed ready start his feet he listened. Yet sat perfectly still. The noise came rapidly nearer. 'What be?' said king again. 'I think must another storm coming mountain,' said Sir Walter. Then Curdie, first word king slipped his seat, laid his ear ground, rose quickly, approaching king said, speaking fast: 'Please, Your Majesty, I think I know is. I time explain, might make late us. Will Your Majesty give orders everybody leave house quickly possible get mountain?' The king, wisest man kingdom, knew well time things must done questions left till afterwards. He faith Curdie, rose instantly, Irene his arms. 'Every man woman follow me,' he said, strode darkness. Before he reached gate, noise grown great thundering roar, ground trembled beneath feet, last crossed court, great hall door came huge rush turbid water, almost swept away. But got safe gate mountain, torrent went roaring road valley beneath. Curdie left king princess look his mother, he his father, one side, caught stream overtook carried safe dry. When king got way water, little mountain, he stood princess his arms, looking back amazement issuing torrent, glimmered fierce foamy night. There Curdie rejoined them. 'Now, Curdie,' said king, 'what mean? Is expected?' 'It is, Your Majesty,' said Curdie; proceeded tell second scheme goblins, who, fancying miners importance upper world were, resolved, fail carrying king's daughter, flood mine drown miners. Then he explained miners done prevent it. The goblins had, pursuance design, let loose underground reservoirs streams, expecting water run mine, lower part mountain, had, supposed, knowing solid wall close behind, broken passage it. But readiest outlet water could find turned tunnel made king's house, possibility catastrophe occurred young miner he laid his ear floor hall. What done? The house appeared danger falling, every moment torrent increasing. 'We must set once,' said king. 'But get horses!' 'Shall I see manage that?' said Curdie. 'Do,' said king. Curdie gathered men-at-arms, took garden wall, stables. They found horses terror; water rising fast around them, quite time got out. But way get out, except riding stream, pouring lower windows well door. As one horse quite enough man manage torrent, Curdie got king's white charger and, leading way, brought safety rising ground. 'Look, look, Curdie!' cried Irene, moment that, dismounted, he led horse king. Curdie look, saw, high air, somewhere top king's house, great globe light shining like purest silver. 'Oh!' he cried consternation, 'that grandmother's lamp! We must get her out. I go find her. The house may fall, know.' 'My grandmother danger,' said Irene, smiling. 'Here, Curdie, take princess I get horse,' said king. Curdie took princess again, turned eyes globe light. The moment shot white bird, which, descending outstretched wings, made one circle round king Curdie princess, glided again. The light pigeon vanished together. 'Now, Curdie!' said princess, he lifted her her father's arms, 'you see grandmother knows it, is not frightened. I believe she could walk water would not wet her bit.' 'But, child,' said king, 'you cold have not Something on. Run, Curdie, boy, fetch anything lay hands on, keep princess warm. We long ride us.' Curdie gone moment, soon returned great rich fur, news dead goblins tossing current house. They caught snare; instead mine flooded country, whence swept drowned. Irene shuddered, king held her close his bosom. Then he turned Sir Walter, said: 'Bring Curdie's father mother here.' 'I wish,' said king, stood him, 'to take son me. He shall enter bodyguard once, wait promotion.' Peter his wife, overcome, murmured almost inaudible thanks. But Curdie spoke aloud. 'Please, Your Majesty,' he said, 'I cannot leave father mother.' 'That is right, Curdie!' cried princess. 'I would not I you.' The king looked princess Curdie glow satisfaction his countenance. 'I think right, Curdie,' he said, 'and I ask again. But I shall chance something time.' 'Your Majesty already allowed serve you,' said Curdie. 'But, Curdie,' said his mother, 'why should not go king? We get well without you.' 'But I cannot get well without you,' said Curdie. 'The king kind, I could half use I you. Please, Your Majesty, would not mind giving mother red petticoat! I got her one long ago, goblins.' 'As soon get home,' said king, 'Irene I search warmest one found, send one gentlemen.' 'Yes, will, Curdie!' said princess. 'And next summer we will come back see wear it, Curdie's mother,' she added. 'Shall not we, king-papa?' 'Yes, love; I hope so,' said king. Then turning miners, he said: 'Will best servants tonight? I hope able return house tomorrow.' The miners one voice promised hospitality. Then king commanded his servants mind whatever Curdie say them, shaking hands his father mother, king princess company rode away side new stream, already devoured half road, starry night. CHAPTER 32 The Last Chapter All rest went mountain, separated groups homes miners. Curdie his father mother took Lootie them. And whole way light, Lootie understood origin, shone upon path. But looked round could see nothing silvery globe. For days days water continued rush doors windows king's house, goblin bodies swept road. Curdie saw something must done. He spoke his father rest miners, proceeded make another outlet waters. By setting hands work, tunnelling building there, soon succeeded; also made little tunnel drain water away king's house, soon able get wine cellar, found multitude dead goblins--among rest queen, skin-shoe gone, stone one fast her ankle--for water swept away barricade, prevented men-at-arms following goblins, greatly widened passage. They built securely up, went back labours mine. A good many goblins creatures escaped inundation upon mountain. But soon left part country, remained grew milder character, indeed became much like Scotch brownies. Their skulls became softer well hearts, feet grew harder, degrees became friendly inhabitants mountain even miners. But latter merciless cobs' creatures came way, length disappeared.
