 MASTERMAN READY CHAPTER ONE. It month October, 18---, _Pacific_, large ship, running heavy gale wind middle vast Atlantic Ocean. She little sail, wind strong, canvas would split pieces furious blasts she driven waves, high, following her almost fast she darted boiling waters; sometimes heaving her stern sinking her bows deep hollow sea, appeared she would dived underneath waves; she fine vessel, captain good seaman, he considered best safety his vessel, put his trust Providence ever watchful us. The captain stood wheel, watching men steering ship; running heavy gale, requires great attention helm: he looked around heavens, he sang low voice words sea song: "One wide water around us, All us one black sky." And them;--they middle Atlantic, another vessel seen, heavens covered black clouds, borne along furiously gale; sea ran mountains high, broke large white foaming crests, fierce wind howled rigging vessel. Besides captain ship two men wheel, two personages deck: one young lad twelve years old, weather-beaten old seaman, whose grisly locks streaming wind, he paced aft looked taffrail vessel. The young lad, observing heavy sea coming stern vessel, caught hold old man's arm, crying out--"Will not great wave come us, Ready?" "No, Master William, not: do not see ship lifts her quarters it?--and passed underneath us. But might happen, would become you, I hold on, hold also? You would washed overboard." "I do not like sea much, Ready; I wish safe shore again," replied lad. "Do not waves look wished beat ship pieces?" "Yes, do; roar angry cannot bury vessel beneath them: I used them, good ship like this, good captain crew, I do not care them." "But sometimes ships sink, everybody drowned." "Yes; often ships sink board think safe. We best, must submit Heaven." "What little birds flying close water?" "Those Mother Carey's chickens. You seldom see except storm, storm coming on." The birds William referred stormy petrels. "Were ever shipwrecked desolate island like Robinson Crusoe?" "Yes, Master William, I shipwrecked; I never heard Robinson Crusoe. So many wrecked undergone great hardships, many never lived tell suffered, it is likely I known one man speak of, many." "Oh! it is book I read. I could tell it--and I ship quiet again; I wish would help below, I promised mamma stay long." "Then always keep promise like good lad," replied old man; "now give hand, I will answer fetch hatchway without tumble; weather fine again, I will tell I wrecked, shall tell Robinson Crusoe." Having seen William safe cabin door, old seaman returned deck, his watch. Masterman Ready, his name, fifty years sea, bound apprentice collier sailed South Shields, he ten years old. His face browned long exposure, deep furrows his cheeks, he still hale active man. He served many years board man-of-war, every climate: he many strange stories tell, he might believed even his stories strange, he would tell untruth. He could navigate vessel, and, course, he could read write. The name Ready well suited him, he seldom loss; cases difficulty danger, captain would hesitate ask his opinion, frequently take his advice. He second mate vessel. The _Pacific_ was, observed, fine ship, well able contend violent storm. She four hundred tons burthen, making passage New South Wales, valuable cargo English hardware, cutlery, manufactures. The captain good navigator seaman, moreover good man, cheerful, happy disposition, always making best everything, accidents happen, always inclined laugh look grave. His name Osborn. The first mate, whose name Mackintosh, Scotsman, rough ill-tempered, paying strict attention his duty--a man Captain Osborn could trust, he like. Ready already spoken of, necessary say anything seamen board, except thirteen them, hardly sufficient number man large vessel; sail, five seamen, like treatment received Mackintosh, first mate, left ship, Captain Osborn choose wait he could obtain others stead. This proved unfortunate, events shall hereafter relate show. CHAPTER TWO. Master William, introduced reader, eldest boy family passengers board, consisting father, mother, four children: his father Mr Seagrave, well-informed, clever man, many years held office government Sydney, capital New South Wales, returning leave absence three years. He purchased government several thousand acres land; since risen much value, sheep cattle he put proving source great profit. His property well managed person charge his absence England, he taking variety articles every description improvement, his use, furniture his house, implements agriculture, seeds, plants, cattle, many things numerous mention. Mrs Seagrave amiable woman, strong health. The family consisted William, eldest, clever, steady boy, but, time, full mirth humour; Thomas, six years old, thoughtless good-tempered boy, full mischief, always scrape; Caroline, little girl seven years; Albert, fine strong little fellow, one year old: he charge black girl, come Cape Good Hope Sydney, followed Mrs Seagrave England. We mentioned people board Pacific: perhaps ought forget two shepherd's dogs, belonging Mr Seagrave, little terrier, great favourite Captain Osborn, she belonged. It fourth day commencement gale abated, gradually subsided nearly calm. The men watching night night gale brought clothes drenched rain spray, hung rigging dry: sails, also, furled, saturated wet, loosened spread might mildewed. The wind blew mild soft, sea gone down, ship running water speed four miles hour. Mrs Seagrave, wrapped cloak, seated upon one arm-chests near stern ship, her husband children her enjoying fine weather, Captain Osborn, taking observation sun his sextant, came them. "Well, Master Tommy, glad gale over?" "I did not care," replied Tommy, "only I spilt soup. But Juno tumbled her chair, rolled away baby, till papa picked up." "It mercy poor Albert killed," observed Mrs Seagrave. "And he might been, Juno thought nothing herself," replied Mr Seagrave. "That is true, sir," replied Captain Osborn. "She saved child, and, I fear, hurt herself." "I thump head hard," said Juno, smiling. "Yes, it is lucky good thick woolly coat it," replied Captain Osborn, laughing. "It 12 of the clock sun, sir," said Mackintosh, first mate, captain. "Then bring latitude, Mr Mackintosh, I work longitude sights I took morning. In five minutes, Mr Seagrave, I shall ready prick place chart." "Here dogs come deck," said William; "I dare say glad fine weather are. Come here, Romulus! Here, Remus!--Remus!" "Well, sir," said Ready, standing his quadrant his hand, "I like ask question. Those dogs two odd names I never heard before. Who Romulus Remus?" "Romulus Remus," replied Mr Seagrave, "were names two shepherds, brothers, ancient days founded city Rome, eventually became largest celebrated empire world. They first kings Rome, reigned together. History says Remus affronted Romulus leaping wall he raised, Romulus, his anger, took away his life; history early days depended upon." "No, brothers either, appears," replied Ready; "however, old story--two trade never agree. One sometimes hears Rome now--is place?" "Yes," replied William, "it remains old city." "Well, one lives learns," said Ready. "I learnt something to-day, everyone last day his life, he ask questions. I am old man, perhaps do not know much, except seafaring way; I known much less I ask information, ashamed acknowledge ignorance; that is way learn, Master William." "Very good advice, Ready,--and, William, I hope profit it," said Mr Seagrave; "never ashamed ask meaning understand." "I always do, papa. Do I ask questions, Ready?" "Yes, do, clever questions boy age; I wish I could answer better I sometimes." "I like go now, dear," said Mrs Seagrave; "perhaps Ready see baby safe." "That I will, madam," said Ready, putting his quadrant capstan: "now, Juno, give child, go first;--backwards, stupid girl! often I tell that? Some day another come run." "And break head," said Juno. "Yes, break arm; hold child?" As soon cabin, captain Mr Seagrave marked position vessel chart, found one hundred thirty miles Cape Good Hope. "If wind holds, shall to-morrow," said Mr Seagrave his wife. "Juno, perhaps may see father mother." Poor Juno shook her head, tear two stole her dark cheek. With mournful face she told them, her father mother belonged Dutch boer, gone many miles interior: she parted quite little child, left Cape Town. CHAPTER THREE. The next morning _Pacific_ arrived Cape anchored Table Bay. "Why call Table Bay, Ready?" said William. "I suppose it is call great mountain Table Mountain, Master William; see flat mountain top." "Yes, quite flat table." "Yes, sometimes see white clouds rolling top curious manner, sailors call spreading tablecloth: sign bad weather." "Then I hope spread tablecloth here, Ready," said William, "for I shall certainly appetite. We bad weather enough already, mamma suffers much it. What pretty place is!" "We shall remain two days, sir," said Captain Osborn Mr Seagrave, "if Mrs Seagrave would like go shore." "I go ask Mrs Seagrave," said her husband, went ladder, followed William. Upon question put Mrs Seagrave, she replied she quite satisfied ship motion, feel herself equal going shore; therefore decided she remain board two younger children, that, following day, Mr Seagrave take William Tommy see Cape Town, return board night. The next morning, Captain Osborn lowered one large boats, Mr Seagrave, accompanied Captain Osborn, went shore William Tommy. Tommy promised his mamma good; he always did, almost always forgot his promise directly he sight. As soon landed, went gentleman's house, Captain Osborn acquainted. They stayed minutes drink glass lemonade, warm; proposed go Company's Gardens see wild beasts confined there, William much delighted, Tommy clapped his hands joy. "What Company's Gardens, papa?" inquired William. "They made Dutch East India Company, time Cape Good Hope possession. They are, properly speaking, Botanical Gardens; but, time, wild animals kept there. Formerly great many, paid attention lately, plenty animals England now." "What shall see?" said Tommy. "You see lions, Tommy, great many large den together," said Captain Osborn. "Oh! I want see lion." "You must go near them, recollect." "No, I will not," said Tommy. As soon entered gates, Tommy escaped Captain Osborn, ran away his hurry see lions; Captain Osborn caught again, held fast hand. "Here pair strange birds," said gentleman accompanied them; "they called Secretaries, account feathers hang behind heads, feather pen clerk puts behind his ear: useful, snake-killers; indeed, would, could, live altogether upon snakes, great enemies to, never letting one escape. They strike feet, force kill immediately." "Are many snakes country?" inquired William. "Yes, venomous snakes," replied Mr Seagrave; "so birds useful destroying them. You observe, William, Almighty, his wisdom, arranged animal (especially noxious kind) shall multiplied excess, kept preyed upon other; indeed, wherever country animal exists quantity, generally found another animal destroys it. The Secretary inhabits country snakes exist numbers, may destroy them: England bird would little value." "But animals large fierce destroyed others, papa; instance, elephant lion." "Very true; larger animals breed fast, therefore numbers increase rapidly. For instance, pair elephants one young one space two years more; rabbits, preyed upon food many beasts well birds, would increase enormously, destroyed. Examine whole creation, find unerring hand, invariably preserves balance exact; mouths food provided, although accidental circumstances may time occasion slight alteration." They continued walk came den lions. It large place, closed strong high wall stone, one window visitors look them, open above. This window wide, strong iron bars running top bottom; width bars lion could put his paw ease; therefore cautioned go near. It fine sight see eight ten noble-looking animals lying various attitudes, quite indifferent apparently people outside--basking sun, slowly moving tufted tails fro. William examined respectful distance bars; Tommy, his mouth open astonishment, first little fear mixed, he soon got bolder. The gentleman accompanied them, long Cape, relating Mr Seagrave Captain Osborn curious anecdotes lion. William interested, perceive Tommy slipped back grated window den. Tommy looked lions, he wanted make move about: one fine full-grown young lion, three years old, lying nearest window; Tommy took stone threw him: lion appeared notice it, he move, although he fixed his eyes upon Tommy; Tommy became brave, threw another, another, approaching time nearer bars window. All sudden lion gave tremendous roar, sprang Tommy, bounding iron bars cage force that, strong, must broken them. As was, shook rattled pieces mortar fell stones. Tommy shrieked; and, fortunately himself, fell back tumbled head heels, lion's paws would reached him. Captain Osborn Mr Seagrave ran Tommy, picked up: he roared fright soon he could fetch his breath, lion stood bars, lashing his tail, snarling, showing his enormous fangs. "Take away--take board ship!" cried Tommy, terribly frightened. "What do, Tommy?" said Captain Osborn. "I will not throw stones, Mr Lion; I will not indeed!" cried Tommy, looking terrified towards animal. Mr Seagrave scolded Tommy well his foolish conduct, degrees he became composed; he recover walked distance away lion's den. They looked animals seen, Tommy keeping respectful distance every one them. He would not even go near Cape sheep broad tail. When seen everything, went back gentleman's house dinner; and, dinner, returned board. CHAPTER FOUR. The following morning fresh water provisions received board, _Pacific_ stretched her broad canvas winds, every prospect rapid voyage, many days she continued her passage fair wind flowing sheet. But continue: fell calm, remained nearly three days, breath wind seen wide expanse water; nature appeared repose, except albatross would drop distance stern vessel, and, he swam lazily along his wings half-furled, pick fragments food thrown side. "What great bird that, Ready?" inquired William. "It albatross, largest sea-bird have. Their wings long. I seen shot, measured eleven feet tip one wing tip wings spread out." "It first one I seen," said William. "Because seldom meet north Cape, sir: people say go sleep wing, balancing high air." "Papa," said William, turning Mr Seagrave, stood by, "why one bird swim another cannot? You recollect Tommy drove hens large pond, flounced about, feathers became wet, would support longer, drowned. Now, sea-bird contrive remain long water?" "Because sea-bird, William, provided sort oil purpose anoint outside feathers, oil prevents water penetrating them. Have observed ducks shore dressing feathers bills? They using oil make feathers waterproof." "How odd!" "Do not say odd, William; expression use talk wonderful provisions made Almighty hand, neglects meanest his creatures--say rather, wonderful!" "That is true, sir," observed Ready; "but still must hard upon Master William, I heard many grownup man make use expression." On third day calm, barometer fell low induce Captain Osborn believe severe gale, every preparation made meet it, come on. Nor he mistaken: towards midnight clouds gathered fast, gathered thick piles, heaped one other, lightning darted every direction; clouds rose up, wind, first heavy gusts, lulling calm. "Ready," said Captain Osborn, "how think shall wind?" "Why, Captain Osborn, tell truth, I do not think steady one point long. It may first blow hard north, it is idea shift soon quarter, blow still harder." "What think you, Mackintosh?" "We will plenty it, long steady gale, that is notion; sooner ship dead lights better." Mr Seagrave, William, happened standing time conversation, term _dead_ lights Willy's face expressed anxiety. Ready perceived it, said-- "That is foolish name give shutters go cabin windows prevent water breaking cabin vessel sails wind; know last time gale." "But, Ready," said Captain Osborn, "why think shall shift wind?" "Well, I do not know; perhaps I wrong," replied old man, "and Mr Mackintosh right: wind seem come steady north-east, that is certain;" Ready walked away binnacle, looked compass. Mr Seagrave William went below, Mr Mackintosh went forward give his orders. As soon gone, Ready went Captain Osborn said: "Captain Osborn, it is contradict Mr Mackintosh, that is little consequence time like this: I held opinion, gentleman passenger his son standing by, now, coast clear, I tell shall something worse gale wind. I latitudes before, I old seaman, know. There is something air, something last three days calm, reminds well I seen before; I sure shall little better hurricane, far wind goes--and worse one point, last much longer hurricanes generally do. I watching, even birds tell so, told nature, never mistaken. That calm nothing repose winds previous roused worst; real opinion?" "Well, I am inclined agree you, Ready; must send topgallant yards deck, small sails lumber tops. Get trysail aft bent, lower gaff. I go forward." Their preparations hardly complete wind settled fierce gale north-east. The sea rose rapidly; topsail topsail furled; dusk _Pacific_ flying water wind her quarter, reefed foresail storm staysail. It difficulty three men wheel could keep helm, blows vessel received heavy seas quarter. Not one seaman ship took advantage his watch go sleep night, careless generally are; storm dreadful. About three of the clock morning wind suddenly subsided; minute two, burst vessel another quarter compass, Ready foretold, splitting foresail fragments, lashed flogged wind till torn away it, carried far leeward. The heavens pitchy darkness, light creaming foam sea every side. The shift wind, west-north-west, compelled alter course vessel, chance scud, did, bare poles; consequence sea taken run former wind, north-east, was, sailors call it, cross, every minute waves poured ship, sweeping weight waters. One poor man washed overboard, attempt made save would unavailing. Captain Osborn standing weather gunnel, holding one belaying-pins, he said Mackintosh: "How long last, think you?" "Longer ship will," replied mate gravely. "I hope not," replied captain; "still cannot look worse. What think, Ready?" "Far fear now," replied Ready, pointing yard-arms ship, little balls electric matter attached, flaring point. "Look two clouds, sir, rushing other; I--" Ready time finish he would said, blaze light, dazzling left utter darkness seconds afterwards, burst upon vision, accompanied peal thunder, whole vessel trembled fore aft. A crash--a rushing forward--and shriek heard, recovered eyesight, foremast rent lightning lath, ship flames: men wheel, blinded lightning, well appalled, could steer; ship broached to--away went mainmast side--and wreck, confusion, dismay. Fortunately heavy seas poured forecastle soon extinguished flames, must perished; ship lay helpless, mercy waves beating violently wrecks masts floated leeward, still held fast vessel rigging. As soon could recover shock, Ready first mate hastened wheel try get ship wind; could do, as, foremast mainmast gone, mizenmast prevented her paying answering helm. Ready, persuaded two men take helm, made sign Mackintosh (for wind loud could hear speak), and, going aft, obtained axes, cut away mizen-rigging; mizen-topmast head mizenmast went side, stump foremast sufficient get ship wind again. Still much delay confusion, could clear away wreck masts; and, soon could make inquiry, found four men killed lightning fall foremast, eight remaining, besides Captain Osborn his two mates. CHAPTER FIVE. Sailors never discouraged danger long chance relieving exertions. The loss shipmates, instantaneously summoned away,--the wrecked state vessel,--the wild surges burying beneath angry waters,--the howling wind, dazzling lightning, pealing thunder, prevent necessity demanded. Mackintosh, first mate, rallied men, contrived fix block strap still smoking stump foremast; rope rove block, main-topgallant sail hoisted, vessel might run faster gale, answer her helm better she did. The ship wind, comparatively safe, notwithstanding heavy blows she received pursuing waves. Night came on, repose, men worn exposure fatigue. The third day gale dawned, appearances alarming ever: continual breaking seas stern washed away binnacles, impossible certain course ship steered, distance run; leaky state vessel proved much she already suffered violent shocks she received, certainty apparent, weather abate, she could possibly withstand force waves much longer. The countenance Captain Osborn showed great anxiety: he heavy responsibility his shoulders--he might lose valuable ship, still valuable cargo, even lose lives; approaching sea studded low coral islands, upon might thrown waves wind, without slightest power prevent present disabled condition. Ready standing Captain Osborn said-- "I do not much like this, Ready; running danger help it." "That is true enough," replied Ready: "we help it; God's will, sir, His done." "Amen!" replied Captain Osborn solemnly; he continued, pause, "There many captains envied I obtained command fine ship,--would change now?" "I rather think not, Captain Osborn, never know day may bring forth. You sailed vessel, full hope--you now, without reason, feel something approaching despair; knows? may please Almighty rebuke angry winds waves, to-morrow may hope best; events done duty--no man more." "You right," replied Captain Osborn; "but hold hard, Ready, sea's aboard us." Ready time cling hands belaying-pins sea poured vessel, volume water time swept legs: clung firmly, last recovered feet. "She started timber two blow, I rather think," said Ready. "I am afraid so; best vessel ever built could stand shocks long," replied Captain Osborn; "and present, weak crew, I see get sail upon her." All night ship flew darkness gale. At daybreak wind abated, sea went down: ship was, however, still kept wind, she suffered much venture put her broadside sea. Preparations made getting jury-masts; worn-out seamen busily employed, direction Captain Osborn his two mates, Mr Seagrave William came upon deck. William stared him: he perceived, his astonishment, tall masts, rigging sails, disappeared, whole deck state confusion disorder. "See, child," said Mr Seagrave, "the wreck devastation here. See pride man humbled elements great Jehovah." "Ay, Master Willy," said old Ready, "look around you, well may. Do remember verses Bible?--if not, I remember well, I often read them, often felt truth them: `They go sea ships, business great waters, see works Lord, his wonders deep.'" "But, father," said Willy, pause, "how shall ever get Sydney without masts sails?" "Why, William," replied Ready, "we must can: sailors never much loss, I dare say night find us sort sail again. We lost great masts, must put jury-masts, call them; is, little ones, little sails upon them; and, pleases God, shall see Sydney yet. How Madam, sir?" continued Ready Mr Seagrave. "Is she better?" "I fear she weak ill," replied Mr Seagrave; "nothing fine weather her good. Do think fine now?" "Why, sir, tell truth, I fear shall yet: I given thoughts captain, I might mistaken; still I think so--I have fifty years sea without learning something. I do not like gathering bank there, Mr Seagrave, I should not wonder blow quarter, dark." "God's done," replied Mr Seagrave, "but I fearful poor wife, worn shadow." "I should not think much that, sir, I really never knew people dying way, although suffer much. William, know lost men since below?" "No--I heard steward say something outside foremast." "We lost five smartest best men--Wilson washed overboard, Fennings Masters struck dead lightning, Jones Emery crushed fall foremast. You young, Master Willy, cannot think early Maker, call mind say burial service,--`In midst life death.'" "Thank you, Ready, lesson given son," said Mr Seagrave; "and, William, treasure memory." "Yes, William, words old man seen many many one full youth spirits called away him, grateful God he pleased preserve his life, allow amend his ways." "I thinking," said Mr Seagrave, silence minute two, "that sailor right marry." "I have always thought so, sir," replied Ready; "and I dare say many poor deserted sailor's wife, she listened wind rain her lonely bed, thought same." "With permission," continued Mr Seagrave, "my boys shall never go sea profession found them." "Well, Mr Seagrave, say it is use baulking lad he wishes go sea, he determined, he must go: I think otherwise--I think parent right say no, he pleases, upon point; see, sir, lad, early age he goes sea, know his mind. Every high-spirited boy wishes go sea--it is quite natural; speak truth, much want go sea, want go school home, control masters parents." "Very true, Ready; wish be, consider be, independent." "And pretty mistake make it, sir. Why, greater slave world boy goes sea, first years his shipping: corrected shore, punished ten times sea, never meet love affection left behind them. It hard life, bitterly repented it, would returned, like prodigal son, cast fathers' feet, ashamed." "That is truth, Ready, account I consider parent justified refusing his consent his son going sea, he properly provide profession. There never want sailors, always plenty poor lads whose friends better them; case seafaring life good one choose, requires capital advancement activity courage." CHAPTER SIX. Mr Seagrave William went cabin, found plenty employment; steward brought basin hot pea-soup children. Tommy, sitting bed-place his sister, snatched Juno's left hand, she held baby other, doing, thrown Caroline, screaming, Juno, her hurry assist Caroline, slipped deck baby, also crying fright, although hurt. Unfortunately, Juno fallen upon Vixen terrier, return bitten her leg, made Juno also cry out; Mrs Seagrave hanging her head her standing bed-place, frightened her wits accident, unable assistance. Fortunately, Mr Seagrave came time pick Juno baby, tried comfort little Caroline, much scalded, soup time cool. "Massa Tommy naughty boy," cried Juno, rubbing her leg. Master Tommy thought better say nothing--he duly admonished-- steward cleaned mess, order length restored. In meantime, idle upon deck; carpenter busy fixing step one spare topmasts instead mainmast, men fitting rigging; ship unfortunately sprung leak, four hands pumps interfered much task. As Ready prophesied, night gale blew, sea rose gale, leaking vessel increased much, labour suspended pump. For two days storm continue, time crew worn fatigue--they could pump longer: ship, she rolled, proved she great deal water her hold--when, melancholy prospects already, new disaster took place, attended serious results. Captain Osborn forecastle giving orders men, strap block hoisted main-topgallant yard stump foremast gave way, yard sail came deck, struck senseless. As long Captain Osborn commanded them, sailors high opinion his abilities seaman, encouraged his cheerful disposition, performed work well cheerfully; he was, killed, events senseless incapable action, longer felt control. Mackintosh much disliked seamen allow his words weight them. They regardless his injunctions requests, consulted among themselves. "The gale broke, men, shall fine weather now," observed Ready, going sailors forecastle. "The wind going fast." "Yes," replied one men, "and ship going fast, that is quite certain." "A good spell pumps would us good now," replied Ready. "What d'ye say, lads?" "A glass grog two would us more," replied seaman. "What d'ye say, boys? I do not think captain would refuse us, poor fellow, he could speak." "What mean do, lads?" inquired Mackintosh: "not get drunk, I hope?" "Why not?" observed another men; "the ship must go soon." "Perhaps she may--I deny it," said Mackintosh; "but reason saved: now, get drunk, chance one saved, life precious me. I am ready join anything please, may decide done; get drunk shall not, I help it, that is certain." "And help it?" replied one seamen, surlily. "Because two resolute men great deal--I may say three, instance Ready side, I call assistance cabin passenger--recollect firearms cabin. But quarrel?--Say intend do; made minds, listen I propose?" As Mackintosh's courage determination well known, seamen consulted together, asked he proposed. "We one good boat left, new yawl booms: others, know, washed away, exception little boat astern, useless, she knocked almost pieces. Now cannot far islands, indeed I think among now. Let us fit boat everything require, go work steadily quietly, drink much grog hurt us, take good provision us. The boat complete her masts, sails, oars; it is hard save somewhere. Ready, I give good advice not?" "You give good advice, Mackintosh--only become cabin passengers, women, children? going leave poor Captain Osborn? mean do?" "We will not leave captain," said one seamen. "No--no!" exclaimed others. "And passengers?" "Very sorry them," replied former spokesman; "but shall enough save lives." "Well, lads, I agree you," said Mackintosh. "Charity begins home. What say?--shall so?" "Yes," replied seamen, unanimously; Ready knew vain expostulate. They set preparing boat, providing wants. Biscuits, salt pork, two three small casks water, barrel rum collected gangway; Mackintosh brought his quadrant compass, muskets, powder shot; carpenter, assistance another man, cut away ship's bulwarks gunnel, enable launch boat overboard, could not, course, hoist her masts gone. In hour everything prepared. A long rope made fast boat, brought gunnel ready launching overboard, ship's broadside brought wind. As done, Mr Seagrave came deck looked around him. He perceived boat ready launching, provisions water gangway, ship brought wind, rolling slowly heave sea; last he saw Ready sitting Captain Osborn, apparently dead. "What this, Ready?" inquired Seagrave. "Are going leave ship? killed Captain Osborn?" "No, sir,--not quite bad that. Poor Captain Osborn struck fall yard, insensible ever since; but, matter, I fear decided: see launching boat." "But poor wife, she never able go--she cannot move--she ill!" "I am afraid, Mr Seagrave, idea taking either you, wife, children, them." "What! leave us perish! Merciful Heaven! cruel--how barbarous!" "It kind, Mr Seagrave, still see law nature. When question life, every one himself, life sweet: unkind would other, many boat hold. I have seen time," replied Ready, gravely. "My wife! children!" cried Mr Seagrave, covering his face his hands. "But I speak them," continued he pause; "surely listen dictates humanity; events Mr Mackintosh power them. Do not think so, Ready?" "Well, Mr Seagrave, I must speak, I confess harder heart among Mr Mackintosh, it is useless speaking one them; must severe upon neither: boat small, could hold people provisions take them--that fact. If take family boat, might perishing together; I thought otherwise I would try I could persuade them, useless." "What must done, then, Ready?" "We must put trust merciful God, Mr Seagrave, dispose us he thinks fit." "We must? What! go them?" "No, Mr Seagrave. I thinking last hour, I made mind remain you. They intend take poor Captain Osborn them, give chance, offered take me; I shall stay here." "To perish?" replied Mr Seagrave, surprise. "As God pleases, Mr Seagrave. I old man, little consequence. I care little whether I taken away year two sooner, I like see blossoms cut early spring: I may use I remain, I have old head upon shoulders, I could leave perish might saved knew act. But seamen come--the boat ready, take poor Captain Osborn them." The sailors came aft, lifted still insensible captain. As going away one said, "Come, Ready, there is time lose." "Never mind me, Williams; I shall stick ship," replied Ready. "I wish success heart; and, Mr Mackintosh, I one promise exact you, I hope refuse me: is, saved, forget leave board, take measures searched among islands." "Nonsense, Ready! come boat," replied first mate. "I shall stay here, Mr Mackintosh; I beg promise I ask. Acquaint Mr Seagrave's friends happened, likely may found, please God save us. Do promise that?" "Yes, I do, determined stay; but," continued he, going Ready, whispering him, "it madness:--come away, man!" "Good-bye, Mr Mackintosh," replied Ready, extending his hand. "You keep promise?" After much expostulation part Mackintosh seamen, Ready gave deaf ear, boat pushed off, made sail north-east. CHAPTER SEVEN. For time boat shoved ship, old Ready remained his arms folded, watching silence. Mr Seagrave stood him; his heart full utterance, he imagined boat increased her distance vessel, every ray hope depart, his wife children, himself, old man his side doomed perish. His countenance man utter despair. At last old Ready spoke. "They think saved must perish, Mr Seagrave; forget Power above, decide point--a power compared efforts weak man nought." "True," replied Mr Seagrave, low voice; "but still chance sinking ship, many helpless creatures around us, I confess I cannot imagine." "We must best, submit His will," replied Ready, went aft, shifted helm, put ship wind. As old man foretold seamen quitted vessel, gale over, sea gone considerably. The ship, however, dragged slowly water, short time Ready lashed wheel, went forward. On his return quarter-deck, he found Mr Seagrave thrown (apparently state despair) upon sail Captain Osborn laid his accident. "Mr Seagrave, give way," said Ready; "if I thought situation hopeless, I would candidly say so; always hope, even worst,--and always ought trust God without whose knowledge sparrow falls ground. But, Mr Seagrave, I shall speak seaman, tell probabilities are. The ship half-full water, her seams opened straining gale, heavy blows she received; but, gale abated, she recovered herself much. I sounded well, find she made many inches within last two hours, probably, she closes her seams, make less. If, therefore, pleases God fine weather continue, fear vessel sinking us time; amongst islands, impossible, nay, probable, may able run her ashore, thus save lives. I thought I refused go boat, I thought also, Mr Seagrave, deserted well rest, would unable take advantage chances might turn favour, therefore I remained, hoping, God's providence, means assisting family sore position. I think would better go cabin, cheerful face encourage poor Mrs Seagrave change weather, hopes arriving place safety. If she know men quitted ship, tell her; say steward men, true enough, and, possible, leave her dark taken place. Master William trusted, send me, I talk him." "I hardly know think, Ready, sufficiently thank self-devotion, I may term it, exigency. That advice excellent I shall follow it, may assured; and, saved death present stares us face, gratitude--" "Do speak that, sir; I old man wants, whose life little use now. All I wish feel is, I trying duty situation pleased God call me. What world offer one roughed his life, neither kith kin he knows care his death?" Mr Seagrave pressed hand Ready, went without making reply. He found his wife asleep last hour, yet awake. The children also quiet beds. Juno William two sitting up. William made sign his father his mother asleep, said whisper, "I like leave cabin deck, steward two hours: he went milk goat baby returned. We breakfast, none us." "William, go deck," replied his father; "Ready wishes speak you." William went deck Ready, explained position placed; he pointed necessity his he could assist his father him, alarm his mother her precarious state health. William, who, may expected, looked grave, did, however, immediately enter Ready's views, proceeded his best. "The steward," said he, "has left men, mother wakes she ask children breakfast. What I do?" "I think milk one goats I show how, I go get things ready; I leave deck, see ship steers herself nicely;--and, William, I sounded well came up, I do not think she makes much water; and," continued he, looking round him, above, "we shall fine weather, smooth sea night." By united exertions Ready William breakfast prepared Mrs Seagrave still continued sound sleep. The motion ship little: she rolled slowly one side other; sea wind gone down, sun shone brightly heads; boat sight time, ship go water faster three miles hour, she sail upon her main-topgallant sail hoisted stump foremast. Ready, time cabin, proposed Mr Seagrave Juno children go deck. "They cannot expected quiet, sir; and, Madam sweet sleep, would pity wake her. After much fatigue she may sleep hours, longer better, know (in short time, I trust) she exert herself." Mr Seagrave agreed good sense proposal, went deck Juno children, leaving William cabin watch his mother. Poor Juno much astonished she came ladder perceived condition vessel, absence men; Mr Seagrave told her happened, cautioned her saying word Mrs Seagrave. Juno promised she would not; poor girl perceived danger position, and, she pressed little Albert her bosom, tear two rolled her cheeks. Even Tommy Caroline could help asking masts sails were, become Captain Osborn. "Look there, sir," said Ready, pointing floating sea-weed Mr Seagrave. "I perceive it," said Mr Seagrave; "but then?" "That would quite proof," replied Ready, "but sailors signs tokens. Do see birds hovering waves?" "I do." "Well, sir, birds never go far land, that is all: now, sir, I will go quadrant; for, although I cannot tell longitude now, events I find latitude in, looking chart shall able give kind guess whereabout are, see land soon. "It nearly noon now," observed Ready, reading his quadrant, "the sun rises slowly. What happy thing child is! Look, sir, little creatures playing about, merry now, unaware danger, home parlour. I often think, sir, great blessing child called away early; selfish parents repine." "Perhaps is," replied Mr Seagrave, looking mournfully his children. "It is twelve of the clock, sir. I will go work latitude, I will bring chart." Mr Seagrave remained deck. He soon deep solemn thought; wondered at--the ship wreck deserted--left alone wide water his wife helpless family, one assist him: one deserted well rest, would his position then? Utter helplessness! And expect? Their greatest hopes gain island, and, succeeded, perhaps desert island, perhaps island inhabited savages--to murdered, perish miserably hunger thirst. It time reflections passed his mind, Mr Seagrave could recall sense thankfulness Almighty hitherto preserved them, could say humility, "O Lord! thy will, mine, done." But, succeeded repressing his murmurs, he felt he courage faith undergo every trial might imposed upon him. "Here chart, sir," said Ready, "and I drawn pencil line latitude: perceive passes cluster islands; I think must among them, near. Now I must put something dinner, look sharp land. Will take look round, Mr Seagrave, especially a-head bows?" Ready went see he could procure dinner, seamen, left ship, collected almost came first hand. He soon procured piece salt beef potatoes, he put saucepan, returned deck. Mr Seagrave forward, looking bows, Ready went him. "Ready, I think I see something, I hardly tell is: appears air, yet clouds. Look there, I point finger." "You are right, sir," replied Ready, "there something; land see, trees upon land refracted, call it, appear, say, air. That island, sir, depend upon it; I go get glass." "It land, Mr Seagrave," said Ready, examining his glass--"yes, so," continued he, musing; "I wish seen earlier; yet must thankful." "Why so, Ready?" "Only, sir, ship forges slowly water, I fear shall reach dark, I wished daylight laid her nicely it." "There little wind now." "Well, let us hope more," replied Ready; "if not, must best. But I must go helm, must steer right island; would pass it, for, Mr Seagrave, although ship leak much she did, yet I must tell I think she could kept twenty-four hours water. I thought otherwise morning I sounded well; I went hold beef, I perceived danger I idea of; however, land, every chance escape; let us thank Lord his mercies." "Amen!" replied Mr Seagrave. Ready went helm steered course land, far distant he imagined, island low: degrees wind freshened up, went faster water; now, trees, appeared air, joined land, could make low coral island covered groves cocoa-nuts. Occasionally Ready gave helm Mr Seagrave, went forward examine. When within three four miles it, Ready came back forecastle said, "I think I see way pretty clear, sir: see windward island, always deep water windward sort isles, reefs shoals leeward; must, therefore, find little cleft coral rock dock her in, were, she may fall back deep water she taken ground, sometimes islands run like wall, forty fifty fathom water close weather-sides them; I see spot I think she may put shore safety. You see three cocoa-nut trees close together beach? Now, sir, I cannot well see I steer, go forward, I steer right, put right hand, left, left; ship's head ought be, drop hand raised." "I understand, Ready," replied Mr Seagrave; went forward directed steering vessel neared island. When within half mile it, colour water changed, much satisfaction Ready, knew weather-side island would steep usually case: still agitating moment ran beach. They within cable's length, still ship ground; little nearer, grating her bottom--it breaking coral-trees grew like forests water--again she grated, harshly, struck, again; last she struck violently, swell lifted her on, remained fast quiet. Ready let go helm ascertain position ship. He looked stern around ship, found she firmly fixed, fore aft, upon bed coral rocks. CHAPTER EIGHT. "All's well far, sir," said Ready Mr Seagrave; "and let us return thanks Heaven." As rose feet again, giving thanks Almighty, William came said, "Father, mother awakened noise ship's bottom, frightened--will go her?" "What matter, dear,--and been?" exclaimed Mrs Seagrave, her husband went below. "I frightened--I sound sleep, I awakened dreadful noise." "Be composed, dear," replied Mr Seagrave; "we great danger, now, I trust, safety. Tell me, better long sleep?" "Yes, much better--much stronger; tell happened." "Much took place, dearest, went sleep, concealed you; now, I expect shall go shore short time--" "Go shore, dear?" "Yes, shore. Now calm, hear happened, much reason grateful Heaven." Mr Seagrave entered detail passed. Mrs Seagrave heard without reply; he finished, she threw herself his arms wept bitterly. Mr Seagrave remained his wife, using his efforts console her, Juno reappeared children, getting late; he returned deck. "Well, sir," said Ready, Mr Seagrave went him, "I looking well me, I think great reason thankful. The ship fast enough, move violent gales come break her up; fear present: little wind is, going down, shall calm morning." "I grant immediate danger, Ready; get shore?--and, shore, exist?" "I thought too, sir, I must assistance, even Master William, get little boat board repair her: her bottom stove in, true, I carpenter enough that, well-tarred canvas I make her sufficiently water-tight land us safety. We must set daylight." "And get shore?" "Why, Mr Seagrave, cocoa-nut trees plenty island, fear starvation, even ship's provisions. I expect little difficulty regard water, island low small; cannot expect find everything exactly wish." "I thankful Almighty preservation, Ready; still feelings I cannot get over. Here cast away upon desolate island, perhaps ship may ever come near, little chance taken off. It melancholy cruel fate, Ready, must acknowledge." "Mr Seagrave, old man compared you, I may venture say ungrateful Heaven give way repinings. What said book Job? `Shall receive good Lord, shall receive evil?' Besides, knows whether good may proceed appears evil? I beg pardon, Mr Seagrave, I hope I offended you; but, indeed, sir, I felt duty speak I done." "You reproved justly, Ready; I thank it," replied Mr Seagrave; "I repine more, make best it." "And trust God, sir, who, he thinks fit, restore friends, increase tenfold flocks herds." "That quotation becomes apt, Ready," replied Mr Seagrave, smiling, "considering prospects flocks herds upon land New South Wales. I must put orders; for, present position, superior--knowledge power. Can anything to-night?" "I little, Mr Seagrave; cannot assist till tomorrow morning, except indeed help drag two spars aft; I rig pair sheers, ready hoisting to-morrow morning get boat in. You see, little strength board, masts, shall obliged contrive." Mr Seagrave assisted Ready getting two spars aft, laid spot required. "There now, Mr Seagrave, may go below. William better let loose two dogs, give little victuals, quite forgot them, poor things. I shall keep watch to-night, I plenty do, plenty think of; so, good-night, sir." Ready remained deck, lashing heads spars, fixing his tackles ready morrow. When done, he sat upon one hen-coops aft, remained deep thought. At last, tired watching exertion, old man fell asleep. He awakened daylight dogs, set liberty, who, walking ship finding nobody, gone sleep cabin door. At daybreak roused up, going deck found old Ready asleep hen-coop, licking his face joy discovered him. "Ay," said old man, he got hen-coop, "you will three useful, I mistake not, by. Down, Vixen, down--poor creature, you have lost good master, I am afraid." "Stop--now let see," said Ready, talking himself; "first--but I will get log board bit chalk, write down, memory quite good was." Ready placed logboard hen-coop, wrote chalk:--"Three dogs, two goats, Billy kid (I think there is five pigs); fowls (quite enough); three four pigeons (I am sure); cow (she lain will not get again, I am afraid, must kill her); there is merino ram sheep belonging Mr Seagrave-- plenty live stock. Now, what is first things must get shore landed--a spar topgallant sail tent, coil two rope, mattress two Madam children, two axes, hammer nails, something eat--yes, something cut with. There, present," said old Ready, getting up. "Now, I will light fire, get water on, and, I think it, boil two three pieces beef pork go shore them; I will call Mr Seagrave, I reckon hard day's work." CHAPTER NINE. As soon Ready executed his intentions, fed animals, he went cabin called Mr Seagrave William. With assistance sheers raised, secured place; boat hooked on, but, one person required bear clear davits taffrail, could hoist in. "Master William, run Juno, tell her come deck assist us--we must work now?" William soon returned Juno, strong girl; and, her assistance, succeeded getting boat in. The boat turned over, Ready commenced his work; Mr Seagrave, his request, put pitch-pot galley fire, ready pitching canvas nailed on. It till dinner-time Ready, worked hard, could patch boat; he payed canvas seams he caulked pitch inside out. "I think shall now, sir," said Ready; "we will drag her gangway launch her. It is fortunate us clear away gunnel, shall trouble." A rope made fast boat, hold her ship: she launched gunnel united exertions Mr Seagrave Ready, great satisfaction she appeared leak little. "Now, sir," said Ready, "what shall first--take things shore, children?" "What say, Ready?" "I think water smooth glass, land anywhere, I better go first reconnoitre,--it two hundred yards beach, shall lose little time." "Very well, Ready, I first run tell wife." "And, meanwhile, I will put sail boat, one two things." Ready put sail in, axe, musket, cord; got boat pulled shore. When landed, found could see nothing interior island, cocoa-nut groves thick; right perceived, quarter mile off, small sandy cove, brushwood growing front cocoa-nut trees. "That," said Ready, pointing it, "must location. Let us get boat pull it." In minutes arrived cove; water shallow, clear crystal. Beneath boat's bottom could see beautiful shells, fish darting every direction. The sand extended forty yards water, commenced brushwood, ran back forty yards further, intermingled single cocoa-nut trees, joined cocoa-nut grove. They pulled boat landed. "What lovely spot is!" exclaimed Mr Seagrave; "and perhaps mortal man never yet visited till now: cocoa-nuts borne fruit year year, died, others sprung stead; spot remained, perhaps centuries, ready man live in, enjoy whenever he come it." "Providence bountiful, Mr Seagrave," replied Ready, "and supplies wants least expect it. If please walk little way wood: take gun precaution, sir; appears much occasion it--there seldom anything wild small islands, except pig two put shore considerate Christians." "Well, grove, Ready, think?" "I looking place fix tent present, sir, I think little rise would good place till look us better; time now, sir, plenty trips make nightfall. If please, we will haul sail articles beach, return board." As pulling boat back, Ready said, "I have thinking best, Mr Seagrave. Would Mrs Seagrave mind leaving her?--if not, I say Juno William shore first, use." "I think she mind left board William children, provided I return her she come shore herself baby." "Well then, let William remain board, please, sir. I will land Juno, Tommy, dogs, time, protection case accidents. You Juno something I return articles shall require." As soon arrived board, Mr Seagrave went cheer his wife account seen. While he below, Ready cast lashings two spars formed sheers, dragging forward, launched gunnel, lines fast them, ready towing shore. In minutes Juno Tommy made appearance deck; Ready put tools boat, couple shovels, he brought he went dogs, landed sandy cove. Tommy stared great deal, speak, he saw shells lying beach, he screamed delight, began pick fast he could; dogs barked galloped about, overjoyed shore; Juno smiled she looked around her, saying Ready, "What nice place!" "Now, Mr Seagrave, I will remain shore little. First, we will load musket case need, put way Tommy, fingers everything, I observe. We take sail us. Juno, carry tools; come back spars, rope, things. Come, Tommy, carry shovel events, make use." Having taken things little knoll Ready pointed before, returned spars; two trips carried everything there, Tommy second shovel his shoulder, proud employed. "Here two trees answer purpose pretty well," said Ready, "as far enough apart: must lash spars them, throw sail over, bring ground ends; beginning, events; I bring canvas shore, set tent trees, also shut two ends them; shall shelter Madam, Juno, younger children, another William, Tommy, ourselves. Now, sir, I will help lash spars, I will leave finish I go board again." "But reach high, Ready?" "Why, sir, manage first lashing spar high conveniently reach, standing lash proper place. I shall bring another spar shore, may set tent." Having plan succeeded lashing spar high enough, throwing sail spar, Ready Mr Seagrave spread out, found made good-sized tent. "Now, sir, I will return board; meantime, cut pegs brush-wood fasten sail ground, shovel cover bottom sand keep down, close enough finished." "I shall well," replied Mr Seagrave; "Juno help pull canvas tight I ready." "Yes; meantime, Juno, take shovel, level inside tent nice smooth, throw old cocoa-nut leaves, look see vermin lurking among them. Master Tommy, must run away; must touch axes, cut do. It may well say, Mr Seagrave, anything happen, require assistance, better fire gun, I come shore immediately." CHAPTER TEN. When Ready returned board, he first went cabin acquaint Mrs Seagrave William done. Mrs Seagrave naturally felt anxious her husband shore alone, Ready informed her agreed anything occur Mr Seagrave would fire musket. He went sail-room get canvas, new topgallant sail there, palm needles twine. Scarcely he got out, foot ladder, report musket heard, Mrs Seagrave rushed cabin greatest alarm; Ready seized another musket, jumped boat, pulled shore fast he could. On his arrival, quite breath, he pulled shore he his back towards it, could see nothing, he found Mr Seagrave Juno busy tent, Tommy sitting ground crying lustily. It appeared that, Mr Seagrave Juno employed, Tommy crept away musket placed end cocoa-nut tree, and, pulling little while, touched trigger. The musket went off; and, muzzle pointed upwards, charge brought two large cocoa-nuts. Mr Seagrave, aware alarm would produce board vessel, scolding soundly, Master Tommy crying, prove penitent he was. "I better return board immediately, sir, tell Mrs Seagrave," said Ready. "Do, pray," replied Mr Seagrave. Ready returned ship, explained matters, recommenced his labour. Having put boat sailmaker's bag, palm needles, two mattresses, blankets captain's state room, saucepan beef pork, spar he towed astern, Ready found he much he could carry; but, nobody it, he came shore well. Having, assistance Mr Seagrave Juno, got things knoll, Ready lashed spar second tent, leaving fix like other, he returned board. He made two trips ship, bringing bedding, bag ship's biscuits, another potatoes, plates, knives forks, spoons, frying-pans cooking utensils, variety articles. He showed Juno fill ends first tent canvas sails he brought shore, inclose round; Juno took needle twine, worked well. Ready, satisfied she would able get without them, said: "Mr Seagrave, two hours daylight, right Mrs Seagrave come shore now; so, please, we will go fetch her children. I think shall able well first night; pleases God give us fine weather, may great deal to-morrow." As soon arrived board, Mr Seagrave went his wife propose her going shore. She much agitated, weak her illness, she behaved courageously notwithstanding, and, supported her husband, gained deck, William following baby, his little sister Caroline carried Ready. With difficulty last placed boat shoved off; Mrs Seagrave ill, her husband obliged support her his arms, William took oar. They landed safely, carried Mrs Seagrave tent, laid her one mattresses. She asked little water. "And I forgotten bring me: well, I stupid old man; I will go board directly," said Ready: "to think I busy bringing things shore forget greatest necessary life! The fact is, I intended look island soon I could, would save great deal trouble." Ready returned board fast he could, brought shore two kegs fresh water, he William rolled tent. Juno completely finished her task, Mrs Seagrave drunk water, declared she much better. "I shall return board to-night," said Ready, "I feel tired--very tired indeed." "You must be," replied Mr Seagrave; "do think more." "And I have not touched food day, even quenched thirst," replied Ready, sitting down. "You ill, not, Ready?" said William. "A little faint, William; I am young I was. Could give little water?" "Stop, William, I will," said Mr Seagrave, taking tin filled his wife: "here, Ready, drink this." "I shall better soon, sir; I will lie little, I will biscuit little meat." Poor old Ready indeed quite tired out; he ate something, felt much revived. Juno busy; she given children salt meat biscuit eat. The baby, Tommy, Caroline put bed, second tent nearly ready. "It well to-night, Juno," said Mr Seagrave; "we done work enough day." "Yes, sir," replied Ready, "and I think ought thank God his mercies us go sleep." "You remind duty, Ready; let us thank his goodness, pray his protection go sleep." Mr Seagrave offered prayer thankfulness; retired rest. CHAPTER ELEVEN. Mr Seagrave first awoke rose his bed ensuing morning. He stepped tent, looked around him. The sky clear brilliant. A light breeze ruffled surface water, tiny waves rippled one another upon white sand cove. To left cove land rose, forming small hills, behind appeared continuation cocoa-nut groves. To right, low ridge coral rocks rose almost wall sea, joined herbage brushwood hundred paces, wreck Pacific, lying like huge stranded monster, formed prominent feature landscape. The sun powerful beams could penetrate; Mr Seagrave stood, cocoa-nuts waved feathery leaves wind, offered impervious shade. A feeling extreme beauty scene, subdued melancholy created sight wrecked vessel, pervaded mind Mr Seagrave he meditated it. "Yes," thought he, "if, tired world anxieties, I sought abode peace beauty, would spot like this. How lovely scene!--what calm--what content--what sweet sadness create! How mercifully preserved hope appeared gone; bountifully provided for, saved,--and yet I dared repine, I ought full gratitude! May God forgive me! Wife, children, safe, nothing regret worldly goods seclusion world time--yes, long time--What! rebellious still!--for time shall please God his wisdom ordain." Mr Seagrave turned back his tent. William, Tommy, old Ready still remained fast asleep. "Excellent old man!" thought Mr Seagrave. "What heart oak hid rugged bark!--Had his devotion might I dear helpless creatures now?" The dogs, crept tent laid upon mattresses side William Tommy, fawned upon Mr Seagrave. William woke whining, received caution his father wake Ready, he dressed came out. "Had I better call Juno, father?" said William; "I think I can, without waking mamma, she asleep." "Then do, can, boy; I see cooking utensils Ready brought shore." William soon returned his father, stating his mother sound sleep, Juno got without waking her two children. "Well, we will see cannot get breakfast ready them, William. Those dry cocoa-nut leaves make excellent fire." "But, father, light fire? tinder-box matches." "No; ways, William, although, them, tinder necessary. The savages produce fire rubbing soft piece wood hard one. But gunpowder; two ways igniting gunpowder--one flint steel, collecting sun's rays one focus magnifying-glass." "But, father, lighted fire, cook? tea coffee." "No, I think have," replied Mr Seagrave. "But potatoes, father." "Yes, William, do not think would better made breakfast cold beef pork ship's biscuit once, use potatoes? may want plant, know. But go board ship ourselves? pull oar pretty well, must learn work now, leave everything poor old Ready do. Come, William." Mr Seagrave went cove; little boat lying beach, lifted rippling waves; pushed her off, got her. "I know steward kept tea coffee, father," said William, pulled board; "mamma would like breakfast, I am sure, I will milk goats baby." Although neither handy oar, soon alongside ship; and, made boat fast, climbed board. William first went cabin tea coffee, left his father collect things he went milk goats, he tin pan. He poured milk bottle, he washed out, might spilt, went back his father. "I filled two baskets full great many things, William, acceptable mamma. What else shall take?" "Let us take telescope, events, father; let us take whole quantity clothes--they please mamma: clean ones drawers--we bring sheet; then, father, let us bring books shore; I am sure mamma long her Bible prayer-book;--here are." "You good boy, William," replied Mr Seagrave. "I take things boat, return rest." In short time everything put boat, pulled shore again. They found Juno, washing herself, waiting cove, assist take things. "Well, Juno, find morning?" "Quite well, massa," said Juno: pointing clear water, she said, "Plenty fish here." "Yes, lines," replied Mr Seagrave. "I think Ready hooks lines somewhere. Come, Juno, take bundle linen tent: manage rest." When arrived tent found every one awake except Ready, appeared still sleep sound. Mrs Seagrave passed good night, felt herself much refreshed. William made touch-paper, he lighted one glasses telescope, soon good fire. Mr Seagrave went beach, procured three large stones rest saucepan on; half hour water boiling tea made. CHAPTER TWELVE. Juno taken children cove, and, walking water her knees, dipped over, shortest way washing them, dressed left mother, she assisted William get cups saucers plates breakfast. Everything laid nice tidy two tents, William proposed he awaken Ready. "Yes, boy, may well now--he want his breakfast." William went pushed Ready shoulder. "Ready, sleep enough?" said William, old man sat up. "Yes, William. I good nap, I expect; I get up, see I get breakfast all." "Do," replied William, laughing. Ready soon dressed, he taken his jacket he lay down. He put on, came tent; when, his astonishment, he found whole party (Mrs Seagrave come children) standing round breakfast, spread ground. "Good-morning, Ready!" said Mrs Seagrave, extending her hand. Mr Seagrave also shook hands him. "You good long sleep, Ready," said Mr Seagrave, "and I would waken fatigue yesterday." "I thank you, sir; I glad see Madam well: I sorry see well without me," continued Ready, smiling. "Indeed, cannot, I am afraid," replied Mrs Seagrave; "had kindness, now?" "We get breakfast ready without you," said Mr Seagrave; "but without you, I think never required another breakfast time. But tell Ready done eat breakfast: now, dear, please." Mrs Seagrave read chapter Bible, afterwards knelt Mr Seagrave offered prayer. While breakfast, William told Ready gone board, brought shore, he also mentioned Juno dipped children sea. "But Juno must again," replied Ready, "until I made safe; know plenty sharks islands, dangerous go water." "Oh, escape had!" cried Mrs Seagrave, shuddering. "It is true," continued Ready; "but do not keep much windward islands present; still smooth cove likely place come into; it is well go again, Juno, I time make place bathe safety. As soon get much want ship, must decide whether shall stay not." "Stay not, Ready!--what mean?" "Why, yet found water, first necessary life--if water side island, must pitch tents somewhere else." "That is true," replied Mr Seagrave; "I wish could find time explore little." "So can, sir; must lose fine weather get things ship. We better go now. You William remain board collect things, I land beach Juno bring up." The whole day spent landing every variety article thought could useful. All small sails, cordage, twine, canvas, small casks, saws, chisels, large nails, elm oak plank, brought shore dinner. After taken hearty dinner, cabin tables chairs, clothes, boxes candles, two bags coffee, two rice, two biscuits, several pieces beef pork bags flour, water, grindstone, Mrs Seagrave's medicine-chest landed. When Ready came again, he said, "Our poor boat getting leaky, take much shore without repaired; Juno able get half things up--they heavy one person. I think shall pretty well now, Mr Seagrave; better, dark, get animals shore. I do not much like trust swim shore, awkward things boat. We will try pig, events; I get one up, William tie legs fowls, put boat; cow, she cannot brought shore, she still lying down, and, I expect, will not get more; however, I given her plenty hay, she do not rise, I kill her, salt her down." Ready went below, squealing pig soon heard; he came deck hanging his back hind legs, threw sea gunnel: pig floundered first; seconds, turned head away ship swam shore. "He goes ashore straight enough," said Ready, who, Mr Seagrave William, watching animal; minute afterwards, Ready exclaimed: "I thought much--we have lost him!" "How?" replied Mr Seagrave. "D'ye see black thing water pushing fast animal?-- that is back fin shark, he poor thing--there, he is got him!" said Ready, pig disappeared water heavy splash. "Well, he is gone; better pig little children, Mr Seagrave." "Yes, indeed, God praised!--that monster might close time Juno took water." "He far off; I reckon," replied Ready. "We will go tie legs four pigs, bring up; what is already boat good load." As soon pigs boat, Ready sculled shore, Mr Seagrave William brought goats sheep ready next trip. Ready soon returned. "Now last trip to-day, and, I judge weather, last trip days; banking thick offing. This trip we will able put boat bag corn creatures, case require it, may say good-bye ship day two least." They got boat, deeply laden, corn heavy, got safe shore, although leaked much. Having landed goats sheep, William led tent, remained quietly; pigs run away, fowls. "That is I call good day's work, Mr Seagrave," said Ready; "the little boat done duty well; must venture her I put her little better condition." They sorry, hard day's work, find Juno prepared coffee them; drinking it, narrated Mrs Seagrave tragically death poor pig shark. Poor Juno appeared quite frightened danger children in, even over. "We shall plenty to-morrow," observed Mr Seagrave, "in getting things places." "We shall plenty time, I expect," replied Ready. "In two months, thereabouts, shall rainy season come on, must cover time, possibly can." "What is first thing must do, Ready?" inquired Mr Seagrave. "To-morrow better fix another tent two, stow away articles brought shore: one good day's work; shall know lay hands upon everything, see want." "That is true; shall then?" "Why then, sir, I think must make little expedition explore island, find must build house." "Can build house?" said William. "Oh, yes, sir, ease would think. There is tree valuable cocoa-nut tree; wood light easily move about." "Why, great merits cocoa-nut tree?" said Mrs Seagrave. "I will tell you, madam: first place, wood build house with; bark make ropes lines, fishing-nets please; leaves thatching house; fruit, which, nut, good eat, useful cooking; young nut milk, also wholesome; oil burn, she will make cups of, have not any, draw toddy tree, pleasant drink fresh, make tipsy kept long. There tree yields many useful things man, supplies almost everything." "At events, we have plenty them," said William. "Yes, William, there is want them; I glad it, few, I liked destroy them. People might wrecked here, well ourselves, without good fortune getting many necessaries shore; might obliged depend wholly upon cocoa-nut trees support." CHAPTER THIRTEEN. When breakfast next morning, Ready observed, "Now, Mr Seagrave, must hold council war, decide upon exploring party to-morrow; and, settled that, find useful way employing rest day. The first question is, party consist?--and upon I wish hear opinion." "Why, Ready," replied Mr Seagrave, "it appears I go." "Surely you, dear," interrupted Mrs Seagrave. "You without husband, not, Ready?" "I certainly liked Mr Seagrave advise with, madam," replied Ready; "but still I thought upon it, think William would quite sufficient protection you; or, events, would feel he was, much thing; so, Mr Seagrave objection, would perhaps better he remained you." "Would go alone, then, Ready?" said Mr Seagrave. "No, sir, I think would right either,--some accident might happen; saying might happen, although every appearance safety. I like, therefore, one me; question is, whether William Juno?" "Take me," said Tommy. "Take you, Tommy!" said Ready, laughing; "then I must take Juno take care you. No; I think cannot spare you. Your mamma want gone; useful gathering wood fire, taking care little sister brother, mother cannot part you; I must either Juno William." "And would prefer, Ready?" said Mrs Seagrave. "William, certainly, madam, let go me, could ill spare girl." "Indeed, I like it; I would rather lose Juno time," replied Mrs Seagrave. "My dear wife," said Mr Seagrave, "recollect Providence preserved us awful dangers--how landed safety. And now, put trust Providence, dangers are, I trust, imaginary?" "I wrong, dear husband; sickness suffering made me, I fear, nervous frightened, selfish: I must shake off. Hitherto I clog incumbrance you; I trust I shall soon behave better, make useful. If think, then, would better go instead William, I quite content. Go, then, Ready, may Heaven protect both!" "No, madam," replied Ready, "William well. Indeed, I would go pleasure; know day may bring forth. I might taken ill--I might hurt myself--I old man, know; I thinking accident happen me, might miss me--that is all." "Pardon me," replied Mrs Seagrave; "a mother foolish times." "Over-anxious, madam, perhaps, foolish," replied Ready. "Well, then, William shall go you, Ready;--that point's settled," observed Mr Seagrave: "what next?" "The next prepare journey. We must take provisions water us, gun ammunition, large axe me, one hatchets William; and, please, Romulus Remus better come us. Juno, put piece beef piece pork pot. William, fill four quart bottles water, I sew knapsack canvas us?" "And shall I do, Ready?" said Mr Seagrave. "Why, sir, sharpen axe hatchet grindstone, would great service, Tommy turn it, he fond work." Tommy jumped directly; he quite strong enough turn grindstone, he much fonder play work; Ready said he fond it, he wished prove case, worked hard. Before went prayers retired night, axe sharpened, knapsacks made, everything else ready. "When intend start, Ready?" said Mr Seagrave. "Why, sir, I like get dawn day, heat great." "And intend come back?" said Mrs Seagrave. "Why, madam, provisions enough three days: start to-morrow morning, Wednesday, I hope back time Friday evening; I will not later Saturday morning I help it." "Good-night--and good-bye, mother," said William, "for I shall see to-morrow!" "God bless protect you, dear child!" replied Mrs Seagrave. "Take care him, Ready, good-bye till meet." Mrs Seagrave went tent hide tears she could suppress. CHAPTER FOURTEEN. Ready sun appeared, he awakened William. The knapsacks already packed, two bottles water each, wrapped round cocoa-nut leaves, prevent breaking, beef pork divided knapsack. Ready's, larger William's, held biscuit several things Ready prepared case might require them. As soon knapsacks on, Ready took axe gun, asked William he thought he could carry small spade his shoulder, brought shore along shovels. William replied he could; dogs, appeared know going, ready standing them. Then, sun rose, turned cocoa-nut grove, soon sight tents. "Now, William, know," said Ready, stopping walked twenty yards, "by means may find way back again; see forest trees rather puzzling, path guide us?" "No, I sure I cannot tell; I thinking thing spoke; Tom Thumb, strewed peas find his way back, could it, birds picked up." "Well, Tom Thumb manage well, must try better; must Americans always woods,--we must _blaze_ trees." "Blaze them! what, set fire them?" replied William. "No, no, William. Blaze term use cut slice bark trunk tree, one blow sharp axe, mark find way back again. They _blaze_ every tree, every tenth tree go along, first one right, one left, quite sufficient; little trouble,--they walk along, without stopping. So we will begin: take side, handy hatchet right hand; I use left. See now--just slice bark--the weight axe almost." "What excellent plan!" observed William. "But I another friend pocket," replied Ready, "and I must use soon." "What that?" "Poor Captain Osborn's pocket-compass. You see, William, _blazing_ direct us go back again; tell us course steer. At present, I know going right, I see wood behind us; shall able, I must make use compass." "I understand well; tell me, Ready, bring spade us--what use it? You say yesterday going bring me." "No, William, I not, I like make mother anxious; fact is, I anxious whether water island; not, shall quit sooner later, although may get water digging sand, would brackish use time, would make us ill. Very often water dig it, although show above-ground; therefore I brought spade." "You think everything, Ready." "No, I not, William; but, present situation, I think things perhaps father mother would: never known put shifts; man like me, his life sea, wrecked, suffered hardships difficulties, obliged think die, greater knowledge, his sufferings, hearing others acted distress. Necessity sharpens man's wits; curious people contrive compelled so, especially seamen." "And going now, Ready?" "Right leeward side island." "Why call leeward side island?" "Because among islands winds almost always blow one way; landed windward side; wind back; put finger, feel even among trees." "No, I cannot," replied William, he held his finger. "Then wet finger, try again." William wet his finger, held again. "Yes, I feel now," said he; "but that?" "Because wind blows wet, feel cold." As Ready said dogs growled, started forward barked. "What there?" cried William. "Stand still, William," replied Ready, cocking his gun, "and I go forward see." Ready advanced cautiously gun his hip. The dogs barked furiously; last, heap cocoa-nut leaves collected together, burst pigs brought shore, grunting galloping away fast could, dogs pursuit them. "It is pigs," said Ready, smiling; "I never thought I half-frightened tame pig. Here, Romulus! here, Remus! come back!" continued Ready, calling dogs. "Well, William, first adventure." "I hope shall meet one dangerous," replied William, laughing; "but I must say I alarmed." "No wonder; for, although likely, possible may wild animals island, even savages; alarmed one thing, afraid another: man may alarmed, stand his ground; man afraid run away." "I think I shall ever run away leave you, Ready, danger." "I am sure not; still must rash; go again, soon I uncocked gun. I seen accidents happen people cocking guns, forgetting uncock afterwards, idea of. Recollect, also, want fire, never cock gun." Ready William continued way cocoa-nut grove hour longer, marking trees went along; sat take breakfast. "Do not give dogs water, William, salt meat; give biscuit only." "But thirsty; may I give little?" "No: shall want ourselves, first place; and, next, I wish thirsty. And, William, take advice, drink small quantity water time. The drink, want." "Then I eat much salt meat." "Very true; less eat better, unless find water, fill bottles again." "But axes, always cut cocoa-nut, get milk young nuts." "Very true; fortunate resort to; still could well cocoa-nut milk alone, even procured year round. Now go feel tired." "Not least; I tired seeing nothing stems cocoa-nut trees, shall glad wood." "Then faster walk better," said Ready; "as far I judge, must half-way across now." Ready William recommenced journey; and, half-an-hour's walking, found ground level been-- sometimes went gradually hill, others down. "I glad find island flat here; better chance finding water." "It much steeper us," replied William; "it is quite hill." The ground became undulating, although still covered cocoa-nut trees, even thicker together before. They continued march, occasionally looking compass, William showed symptoms weariness, wood become difficult get first. "How many miles think walked, Ready?" said Willy. "About eight, I think." "Not eight?" "No; I think made two miles hour: it is slow work, travelling compass marking trees; I think wood looks lighter us, top hill." "It does, Ready; I fancy I see blue sky again." "Your eyes younger mine, William, perhaps may--however, shall soon find out." They descended small hollow, went hill again. As soon arrived top, William cried out, "The sea, Ready! there is sea!" "Very true, William, I am sorry it." "I thought never get nasty wood again," said William, he impatiently pushed on, last stood clear cocoa-nut grove. Ready soon joined him, surveyed scene silence. CHAPTER FIFTEEN. "Oh! beautiful!" exclaimed William, last; "I am sure mamma would like live here. I thought side island pretty, it is nothing compared this." "It beautiful," replied Ready, thoughtfully. A lovely scene could scarcely imagined. The cocoa-nut grove terminated quarter mile beach, abruptly, rapid descent thirty feet stood land below, mixture little grass knolls brushwood, fifty yards water's edge, met dazzling white sand, occasionally divided narrow ridges rock ran inland. The water deep blue, except broken white foam reefs, extended miles beach, rocks showed water. On rocks perched crowds gannets men-of-war birds, others wheeled air, every darting blue sea, bringing bills fish shoals rippled water, bounded clear gambols. The form coast horse-shoe bay--two points land covered shrubs extending far side. The line horizon, far sea, clear unbroken. Ready remained time without speaking; he scanned horizon right left, he turned his eyes along land. At last William said: "What thinking of, Ready?" "Why, I thinking must look water fast can." "But anxious?" "Because I see island leeward us I expected, therefore less chance getting island; bay, although beautiful, full reefs, I see inlet, makes awkward many reasons. But cannot judge first sight. Let us sit take dinner, explore little." Ready cut two wide marks stems cocoa-nut trees, descended William low ground, sat eat dinner. As soon meal finished first walked water's edge, Ready turned his eyes inland see he could discover little ravine hollow might likely contain fresh water. "There one two places there," observed Ready, pointing his finger, "where water run rainy season: must examine carefully, now. I want find whether means getting little boat reef rocks, otherwise shall hard work (if change abode spot) bring stores wood; pass rest day examining coast, to-morrow try fresh water." "Look dogs, Ready, drinking sea-water, poor things!" "They will not drink much that, I expect; see do not like already." "How beautiful corals are--look here, grow like little trees water,--and look here, really flower bloom growing rock water." "Put finger it, Master William," said Ready. William so, flower, he called it, immediately shut up. "Why, it is flesh, alive!" "Yes, is; I often seen before: call sea-anemones--they animals; I do not know whether she will-fish not. Now, let us walk end point land, see discover opening reef. The sun going down, shall hour's daylight, must look place sleep in." "But that?" cried William, pointing sand--"that round dark thing?" "That is I am glad see, William: it is turtle. They come time evening drop eggs, bury sand." "Cannot catch them?" "Yes, catch go quietly; must take care go behind them, throw shower sand upon you, hind flappers fins, would blind escape time. The way catch get heads turn backs one fore-fins, cannot turn back again." "Let us go catch one." "I think foolish so, could take away, would die to-morrow heat sun." "I think that, Ready; come live here, I suppose shall catch whenever want them." "No, shall not, come shore breeding-season; make turtle pond somewhere cannot get of, sea flows into; catch put it, ready use require them." "That good plan," replied William. They continued walk, and, forcing way brushwood grew thick upon point land, soon arrived end it. "What there?" said William, pointing right stood. "That another island, I glad see even direction, although easy gain it, obliged leave want water. It much larger island this, events," continued Ready, scanning length horizon, along he could see tops trees.--"Well, done well first day, go look place lie pass night." They returned high ground cocoa-nut grove ended, collecting together several branches piles leaves, made good soft bed trees. "And we will go bed. Look, William, long shadow trees sun nearly set." "Shall I give dogs water now, Ready? See, poor Remus licking sides bottles." "No, give any: appears cruel, I want intelligence poor animals to-morrow, want water make keen, shall turn good account. So now, William, must forget return thanks merciful God, beg his care us night. We little know day may bring forth. Good-night!" CHAPTER SIXTEEN. William slept sound he shore England upon soft bed warm room--so old Ready; awoke next morning broad daylight. The poor dogs suffering want water, pained William see tongues out, panting whining looked him. "Now, William," said Ready, "shall take breakfast start, walk first?" "Ready, I cannot really drink drop water myself, I thirsty, unless give little poor dogs." "I pity poor dumb creatures much do, Master Willy; kindness too, makes refuse them. However, like, take walk first, see find water. Let us first go little dell right, succeed, try farther water run rainy season." William glad go, away went, followed dogs, Ready taken spade, he carried his shoulder. They soon came dell, dogs put noses ground, snuffed about. Ready watched them; last lay panting. "Let us go on," said Ready, thoughtfully; went run water appeared been--the dogs snuffed eagerly before. "You see, William, poor dogs eager water, any, find never could. I do not expect water above-ground, may it. This beach hardly far enough water's edge, I try sand it." "In sand--but would salt?" replied William. "No, good distance sea-beach; see, William, sand degrees filters sea-water fresh, often sand runs long way high-water mark, dig down, find good fresh water, times little brackish, still fit use." "Look, Ready, Romulus Remus--how hard digging paws hollow." "Thanks Heaven are! You do not know happy made feel: for, tell truth, I beginning alarmed." "But dig?" "Because water there, poor animals. Now see advantage kept pain hours; probability saving us, must either found water quitted island. Now let us help poor dogs spade, shall soon rewarded sufferings." Ready walked quickly dogs continued digging: already got moist earth, eagerly work, difficulty he could get his way use his spade. He dug two feet water trickled down, four five minutes dogs sufficient plunge noses in, drink copiously. "Look them! enjoy it! I do not think Israelite felt grateful Moses struck rock I now, William. This one thing wanting, one thing indispensable. Now everything wish island, content, may happy--ay, much happier worrying heap riches, knowing shall gather them. See, poor animals enough last. Now, shall go back breakfast?" "Yes," replied William: "I shall enjoy now, good drink water myself." "That plenteous spring, depend upon it," said Ready, walked back slept left knapsacks; "but must clear among trees, sun cannot reach it, cool, dried up. We shall plenty work next year least, remain here. Where capital spot build house on." As soon breakfast over, Ready said, "Now must go explore point, see, William, I yet found passage reef, little boat must come round side island, point side I must try find entrance. When I opposite point appear water broken close point; passage shall fortunate." They soon arrived end point land, found Ready wrong his supposition; water deep, passage many yards wide. The sea smooth, water clear, could see rocky bottom, watched fish darted along. "Look there!" said Willy, pointing fifty yards beach, "a great shark, Ready!" "Yes, I see him, sir," replied Ready: "there is plenty here, depend upon it; must careful get water: sharks always keep leeward island, one Juno bathed little brother, find fifty here. I am quite satisfied now, William, shall well, think moving away side island fast possible." "Shall go back to-day?" "Yes, I think so, shall idle here. It twelve of the clock, I think, shall plenty time. I think better start once; leave spade axe here, use taking back again. The musket I take along. But first let us go back look spring, see water flows." As walked along edge sandy beach found sea-birds hovering close them: sudden large shoal fish threw high dry sand, followed several larger size, also lay flapping beach, sea-birds, darting close feet William Ready, seizing fish, flew away them. "How strange!" said William, surprised. "Yes, sir; see is--the small fish chased larger ones, bonettas, fright ran upon beach. These bonettas anxious catch them, came shore also, gannets picked up." They found hole Ready dug quite full water, and, tasting it, proved sweet good. Overjoyed discovery, covered articles agreed leave behind boughs notched cocoa-nut trees, and, calling dogs, set journey back cove. CHAPTER SEVENTEEN. Guided marks made trees, William Ready made rapid progress return, less two hours found almost clear wood taken nearly eight hours force way day before. "I feel wind now, Ready," observed William, "and must nearly wood; appears dark." "I thinking same," replied Ready. "I wonder storm brewing up; so, sooner back better." As proceeded, rustling waving boughs trees, ever anon gust wind, followed moaning creaking sound, proved fact; emerged grove, perceived sky, became visible them, one dark leaden hue, longer brilliant blue usually presented sight. "There indeed gale coming on," said Ready, cleared wood: "let us go tents fast possible, must see secure make it." The dogs bounded forward; appearance tents Mr Seagrave Juno came out, seeing Ready William advancing, made known welcome tidings Mrs Seagrave, who, children, remained within. In moment William pressed his mother's arms. "I glad come back, Ready," said Mr Seagrave, shaking hand he embraced William, "for I fear bad weather coming on." "I sure it," replied Ready, "and must expect blusterous night. This one storms forerunners rainy season. However, good news you, must take warning hasten departure soon possible. We shall fine weather month so, although must expect breeze then. But must work hard best; now, please, Juno, William I, go haul boat far beach possibly can, waves high run long way up, boat main dependence soon." The four went soon Ready sawed ends spars cut off, three rollers, fix keel; help afforded them, boat soon hauled high brushwood, considered Ready perfectly safe. "I meant worked upon her immediately," observed Ready; "but I must wait till gale over; I hope got board more, looked things I since remembered would useful; I strongly suspect," continued he, looking weather, "that shall never go board poor vessel again. Hear moaning coming storm, sir; look sea-birds wheel scream, proclaim her doom; must wait here--the tents must made secure, hold small force wind, I mistake not." Ready, assisted Mr Seagrave, got heavy canvas lines, commenced putting double cover tents, keep rain; also secured tents guys stays rope, prevent blown down; Juno shovel deepened trench made round tents, water might run easily. During time work, Ready made Mr Seagrave acquainted discovered done exploring expedition, adventure pigs made laugh heartily. As sun went down, weather threatened still more; wind blew strong, rocky beach lashed waves white spray, surf roared poured broke upon sand cove. The whole family retired bed except Ready, said he would watch weather little he turned in. The old man walked towards beach, leaned gunnel boat, he remained his keen grey eye fixed upon distance, one opaque mass, except white foam waters gleamed darkness night! "Yes!" thought he; "the winds waves summoned his bidding, evenly work together--as one rises, other; one howls, roars concert--hand hand go fury force. Had called one week since, would been, were, intrusted weak help? The father, mother, children, infant breast, I, grey-headed old man,--all buried fathoms deep, awaiting summons; restrained his will, his saved. Will timbers bore us miraculously hold together till morning? I think not. What iron bolts fastenings weak man, compared force God's elements: snap yarns; to-morrow's dawn, fragments stout ship washing tossing wild surf. Well, kindness us, waters perform labour could not; break timbers use, throw shore hold articles could reach little strength." A sharp flash lightning struck upon old man's eyes, obstructed his vision moment. "The storm soon height," thought he; "I watch tents, see stand force." Then rain came pattering down, wind howled louder before. In minute two darkness became intense he could hardly find his way back tents. He turned round, could see, he blinded heavy rain. As nothing could done, he went tent sheltered storm, although he would lie down, lest his services might required. The others retired bed, exception Tommy children, taken clothes. CHAPTER EIGHTEEN. The storm raged furiously, lightning accompanied loud peals thunder, children awoke cried fright, till hushed sleep again. The wind howled pressed violence tents, rain poured torrents. One moment canvas tents would bulge in, cords held strain crack; another, eddy wind would force canvas, would flap flap, rain found many entrance. The tent Mrs Seagrave children reposed outside others, therefore exposed. About midnight wind burst greater violence before. A loud crash heard Ready Mr Seagrave, followed shrieks Mrs Seagrave Juno; pegs tent given way, inmates exposed fury elements. Ready rushed out, followed Mr Seagrave William. So strong wind beating rain, darkness, difficulty united efforts women children could extricated. Tommy first taken Ready: his courage gone, he bellowing furiously. William took Albert charge carried tent, Tommy sat his wet shirt roaring melodiously. Juno, Mrs Seagrave, little girl last carried away taken tent: fortunately one hurt, although frightened children could pacified, joined chorus Tommy. Nothing could done except put children bed, whole party sat remainder night listening noise wind, roaring sea, loud patter rain canvas. At dawn day, Ready went out, found gale spent force, already much abated; one bright glorious mornings accustomed since arrival island: sky still dark, clouds chasing wildly; neither sun blue sky seen: still rained, intervals, earth soft spongy; little cove, day beautiful, mass foaming tumultuous waves, surf thrown many yards upon beach: horizon confused--you could distinguish line water sky, whole shore island lined white foam. Ready turned his eyes ship fixed rocks: longer there--the whole frame disappeared; fragments it, contents holds, floating every direction, tossing amongst surf beach. "I thought much," said Ready, pointing ship lain, he turned round found Mr Seagrave followed him; "look, sir, gale broken her entirely. This warning us remain longer: must make fine weather may rainy season sets in." "I agree you, Ready," replied Mr Seagrave,--"and another proof it," pointing tent blown down. "It mercy none hurt." "Very true, sir; gale breaking, shall fine weather to-morrow. Let us see tent, William Juno try get breakfast." They set work. Ready Mr Seagrave made fast fresh cords pegs, soon ready; beds bedding wet through. They hauled wet canvas, left go breakfast, Juno summoned them. "We need present," said Ready, "by night-time wet, handle easier. I see break sky promises fine weather soon. And better work hard to-day, may save great many things, may dashed pieces rocks, haul beach." CHAPTER NINETEEN. They went beach. Ready first procured stores good stout rope; waves threw casks timbers vessel, stopped washed back again, either rolled hauled rope safely landed. This occupied major part day; yet collected quarter articles reach, independent quantity floated sea entrance cove. "I think," said Ready, "we done good day's work; tomorrow shall able much more, sea going down, sun showing corner cloud. Now go supper, see make comfortable night." The tent blown given Mrs Seagrave children, fitted well could be. The bedding wet, procured sails stores, which, stowed away farther grove, suffered much tempest; and, spreading canvas, lay down, night passed without disaster, wind lulled pleasant breeze. The next morning sun shone bright--the air fresh bracing; slight breeze rippled waters, little surf. The various fragments wreck tossed little surf still remained; many things lying beach landed night, many required little trouble secure them. There appeared sort draught cove, articles floating sea gradually coming shore direction. Ready Mr Seagrave worked till breakfast-time, time saved great many casks packages. After breakfast went beach resumed labours. "Look, Ready; that?" said William, them, he pointed white-looking mass floating cove. "That, sir, poor cow; look again, see sharks around, making feast her: do not see them?" "Yes, I do--what quantity!" "Yes, there is want them, William; careful get water, never let Tommy go near it, do not care shallow see food. But now, sir," said Ready, "I must leave William saving wreck, I set put boat proper repair." Ready left employment, went away his tools. During time Mr Seagrave William occupied collecting different articles thrown shore, rolling casks far could. As would take days Ready put boat proper order, Mr Seagrave determined he would go side island William, he might examine himself; and, Mrs Seagrave objection left Ready Juno, third day gale set off. William led way, guiding his footsteps grove blazing cocoa-nut trees; two hours reached destination. "Is beautiful, father?" said William. "Yes, indeed is, dear boy," replied Mr Seagrave. "I fancied nothing could beautiful spot reside, surpasses it, variety, extent." "And let us examine spring, father," said William, leading way ravine. The spring full flowing, water excellent. They directed steps towards sandy beach, and, walked time, sat upon coral rock. "Who would ever imagined, William," said Mr Seagrave, "that island, many abound Pacific Ocean, could raised work little insects bigger pin's head?" "Insects, father?" replied William. "Yes, insects. Give piece dead coral, William. Do see every branch hundred little holes? Well, every one little holes lived sea-insect; insects increase, branches coral-trees." "Yes, I understand that; make island made them?" "Almost islands seas made labour increase small animals. The coral grows first bottom sea, disturbed winds waves: degrees, increases, advances higher higher surface, till last comes near top water; stopped growth force winds waves, break off, course never grows water, animals would die." "Then become island?" "By slow degrees; time, perhaps, much depending upon chance: instance, log wood floating about, covered barnacles, may ground upon coral reefs; would sufficient commencement, would remain water, shelter coral leeward it, flat rock formed, level edge water. The sea-birds always looking place rest upon, would soon find it, droppings would, course time, form little patch water, floating substances would thrown it; land-birds, blown sea, might rest it, seeds stomachs, dropped, would grow trees bushes." "I understand that." "Well then, William, observe island commenced, were, and, commenced, soon increases, coral would protected leeward, grow fast. Do observe coral reefs extend side island, protected winds waves; different weather side, left? Just little patch water protects corals leeward, island increases fast; birds settle it, make nests rear young, every year soil increases; then, perhaps, one cocoa-nut great outside she will last thrown little patches--it takes root, becomes tree, every year shedding large branches, turned mould soon decay, dropping nuts, take root grow mould; thus continue, season season, year year, island becomes large thickly covered trees one standing upon. Is wonderful, dear boy? Is he great good God make minute animals work his pleasure, time he thinks fit produce beautiful island this?" "Indeed he is!" exclaimed William. "We need use eyes, William, shall love well adore. Look she will--is beautifully marked?--could best painter world equal colouring?" "No, indeed,--I think not." "And yet thousands sight, perhaps millions water. They coloured way admired, like works man; island till probably without one upon it, one ever seen them. It makes difference Him, wish, complete." For minutes conversation, Mr Seagrave William silent. Mr Seagrave rose he sitting: "Come, William, let us find way back again; three hours' daylight left, shall home good time." CHAPTER TWENTY. Everything preparing removal leeward side island. Ready nearly completed boat; he given thorough repair, fitted mast sail. William Mr Seagrave continued collect secure various articles thrown shore, particularly would injured exposure weather: rolled carried cocoa-nut grove, sheltered sun; many things thrown shore day day, hardly knew had: secured case cask one another, waiting better opportunity examine contents. At last collected great many articles together, and, shovels, covered sand, impossible get beach without time could spare. Neither Mrs Seagrave, getting quite strong, Juno, idle. They made everything could packages, ready moving. On eighth day gale, ready, arranged Ready put boat bedding canvas one tent, take William his expedition. Having transported safe, he return load necessary articles, family walk grove side island, remain Mr Seagrave Ready William returned tent; that, boat make many trips weather would permit, till brought things absolutely required. It lovely calm morning Ready William pushed boat, well loaded; soon clear cove hoisted sail, went away wind along coast. In two hours run eastern end island, hauled close inshore: point ran out, end inlet, mile them, short time lowered sail, pulling sandy beach. "You see, William, fortunate us shall always fair wind come loaded, pull empty boat back again." "Indeed is. How many miles think cove part island?" "About six seven, more: island, see, long narrow. Now let us get things carry up, back cove long dark." The boat soon unloaded, way carry things. "We shall mind gale day tents pitched here, William," said Ready, "for shall protected whole width cocoa-nut grove. We shall hardly feel wind, although shall rain, come torrents." "I must go see spring gets on," said William, "and get drink it." Willy reported spring brim water, he never drunk water excellent. They pushed boat, and, rowing two hours more, found entrance cove, Mrs Seagrave, Tommy her side, waving her handkerchief them. They soon pulled beach, and, landing, received congratulations whole party first successful voyage, expressed delight proved much shorter anticipated. "Tommy go next time," said Master Tommy. "By by, Tommy grows little taller," replied Ready. "Massa Tommy, come help milk goats," said Juno. "Yes, Tommy milk goats," said little urchin, running Juno. "You must almost tired eating nothing salt meat biscuit, madam," said Ready, sat meal; "but safe side island hope feed better. At present hard work hard fare." "As long children well, I care little it; I must say that, last gale, I anxious side island, especially account William given it. It must paradise! When set off?" "Not till day to-morrow, madam, I think; see I must another trip cooking utensils bundles made up. If spare Juno walk wood William to-morrow, tent ready children." CHAPTER TWENTY ONE. Old Ready his boat loaded made sail side island long family up; indeed, dressed he landed his whole cargo beach, sitting quietly taking his breakfast. As soon he eaten beef biscuit he taken him, he carried things he brought, commenced arrangements setting tent, intending await arrival William Juno, might assist getting spars canvas it. About ten of the clock William made his appearance, leading one goats string, followed others. Juno came sheep, also holding one cord; rest quietly joined procession. "Here last!" said William laughing; "we terrible work woods, Nanny would run one side tree I went other, I let go string. We fell pigs again, Juno gave squall!" "I tink  them wild beast," said Juno. "Ah! nice place! Missis like live here." "Yes, nice place, Juno; you will able wash here, never mind saving water." "I thinking," said William, "how get fowls here; wild, still cannot catch them." "I will bring to-morrow, William." "But catch them?" "Wait till gone roost, may catch please." "And I suppose pigeons pigs must run wild?" "The best thing them." "Then shall shoot them, I suppose?" "Well, William, shall; pigeons also, become plentiful, remain long. We shall soon well stocked live plenty. But must help get tent everything order, mamma may find things comfortable her arrival, she tired, I dare say, walking wood." "Mamma much better she was," replied William. "I think she soon quite strong again, especially she comes live beautiful place." "We great deal work do, get rainy season; pity, cannot helped; time next year shall comfortable." "Why, besides putting tents shifting here?" "In first place build house, take long while. Then ought make little garden, sow seeds father brought England him." "Oh! nice; shall make it, Ready?" "We must put fence across point land, dig brushwood; mould good." "Then next?" "Then shall want storehouse things got, wood beach: consider many trips shall make little boat bring round." "Yes, true, Ready. Have anything do?" "Plenty; build turtle-pond fish-pond, bathing-place Juno wash children in. But first must make proper well spring, plenty fresh water: there is enough year's hard work least." "Well, let us get mamma children here, work hard." "I wish much see done, William," said Ready. "I hope life spared till done, events." "But say that, Ready? old man, strong healthy." "I now; Book say?--`In midst life death.' You young healthy, promise long life; knows may summoned away tomorrow. Can I, then, old man, worn hardships, expect live long? No--no, William! Still I like remain long I useful, I trust I may depart peace. I never wish leave island; I kind feeling bones remain it. God's done!" For time Ready finished, neither said word, continued employment, stretching canvas tent, fastening ground pegs. At last William broke silence. "Ready, say Christian name Masterman?" "So is, William." "It odd Christian name! You called person?" "Yes, I was, William; he rich man." "Do know, Ready, I like much one day tell history--I mean whole life, time boy." "Well, perhaps I may, William; many parts life would prove lesson others: must got work." "How old you, Ready?" "I turned sixty-four; old age seaman. I could obtain employment board vessel I well known several captains." "But say `old seaman?'" "Because sailors live faster people, partly hardships undergo, partly fault drinking much spirits; often reckless care nothing healths." "But never drink spirits now?" "No, never, William; early days I foolish others. Now, Juno, may bring bedding. We two three hours yet, William; shall next?" "Had better make fireplace ready cooking?" "It I going propose, not. I shall to-morrow long you, I take care supper ready arrival." "I brought bottle water knapsack," replied William, "not much water, I want milk goats take back milk baby." "You proved thoughtful kind, William: Juno fetch stones fireplace, I stow away trees things I brought boat." "Shall let goats sheep loose, Ready?" "Oh, yes,--there fear straying; herbage better side, plenty it." "Well, I let Nanny go soon Juno milked her. Now, Juno, let us see many stones carry once." In hour fireplace made, Ready done he could, goats milked let loose, William Juno set journey back. Ready went beach. On his arrival there, he observed small turtle: creeping softly he got water, succeeded turning over. "That to-morrow," said he, he stepped boat; laying hold oars, he pulled bay return cove. CHAPTER TWENTY TWO. Ready arrived cove, proceeded tents, he found whole party listening William, detailing done. The arrangements next day made soon Ready joined them. They separated night, Ready William remained dark, catch fowls tie legs, ready put boat next morning. At daylight summoned dress soon possible, Ready wanted take tent Mrs Seagrave children slept. For, exception Tommy, others slept upon canvas, spread cocoa-nut trees. As soon Mrs Seagrave dressed, tent taken down, and, bedding, put boat. Then, breakfasted, plates, knives forks, necessaries, also put in; Ready laid fowls top all, set new location. After he gone, rest party prepared journey cocoa-nut grove. William led way, three dogs close his heels, Mr Seagrave baby his arms, Juno little Caroline, Mrs Seagrave Master Tommy holding her hand. They cast last look round cove, fragments wreck cargo, strewed every direction, turned wood. Ready arrived point, shore less two hours he set off. As soon boat safe in, he wait land his cargo, going turtle he turned day before, he killed it, cleaned beach. He went built fireplace stones, made fire, filled iron saucepan full water, set boil; he cut portion turtle, put pot, slices salt pork, covered up, left boil; hung rest turtle shade, he went back beach unload boat. He released poor fowls, soon busy seeking food. It two three hours he carried everything up, good distance, articles heavy, old man sorry he finished his task, could sit rest himself. "It is almost time arrived," thought Ready; "they must started nearly four hours ago." Ready remained quarter hour watching fire, occasionally skimming top pot, three dogs came bounding towards him. "Well, far now," observed Old Ready. In six seven minutes afterwards party made appearance, hot fatigued. It appeared poor little Caroline tired out, Juno carry her; Mrs Seagrave complained fatigue, rest quarter hour; Tommy, refused remain his mamma, running backwards forwards one other, declared he tired, someone must carry him; one carry him, he began cry stopped another quarter hour till he rested; soon went he complained tired. William carried pickaback time, he missed blaze-cut trees, long he could find again; baby became hungry, he cried, little Caroline frightened long wood, she cried. But finally got better, arrived last warm exhausted, Mrs Seagrave went tent children repose little, she could even look place future residence. "I think," said Mr Seagrave, "that little journey to-day pretty good proof helpless without you, Ready." "I glad here, sir," replied Ready, "it weight mind; get better. I think may live comfortably here; still much do. As soon Madam rested, dinner fix tent, quite enough hard day's work." "Do go back cove to-morrow, Ready?" "Yes, sir, want stores here; take three trips empty storehouses; things, examine bring leisure. As soon I made three trips boat, work altogether." "But I something meantime." "Oh yes, plenty do." Mr Seagrave went tent, found his wife much refreshed; children fallen fast asleep beds. They waited another half-hour, woke Tommy Caroline, might sit dinner. "Dear me," exclaimed William, Ready took cover saucepan, "what good there?" "It is treat I prepared all," replied Ready. "I know tired salt meat, going feed like aldermen." "Why, it, Ready?" said Mrs Seagrave; "it smells good." "It turtle-soup, madam; I hope like it; for, do, may often it, side island." "Indeed, really excellent; wants little salt. Have salt, Juno?" "Got little, madam. Very little left," replied Juno. "What shall salt gone?" said Mrs Seagrave. "Juno must get more," replied Ready. "How I get salt?--hab none left," replied Juno, looking Ready. "There is plenty there, Juno," said Mr Seagrave, pointing sea. "I do not know where," said Juno, looking direction. "What mean, dear?" inquired Mrs Seagrave. "I mean want salt much please boiling salt-water kettle, else making salt-pan rocks, obtaining sun drying water leaving salt. Salt always procured way, either evaporation, boiling." "I will soon arrange you, madam," said Ready, "and show Juno get she wants it." "I glad hear say so; I feel want salt much," replied Mrs Seagrave, "I really never enjoyed dinner much I to-day." The soup pronounced excellent everybody. As soon finished, Mrs Seagrave remained children; Ready Mr Seagrave, assisted Juno William, got second tent up, everything ready night. They assembled, returned thanks God gained new abode; and, tired fatigue day, soon fast asleep. CHAPTER TWENTY THREE. Mr Seagrave first ensuing morning; Ready came tent, he said him, "Do know, Ready, I feel much happier mind much ease since I find here. On side island everything reminded shipwrecked; I could help thinking home country; appear long settled, come choice." "I trust feeling stronger every day, sir; it is use, indeed sinful, repine." "I acknowledge it, humility. What first thing wish set about?" "I think, sir, first object good supply fresh water; I therefore wish William--Here he is. Good-morning, William--I saying I thought better Mr Seagrave clear spring I away boat. I brought another shovel yesterday, work; perhaps better go there, Juno, I see, getting breakfast ready. You observe, Mr Seagrave, must follow spring till get among cocoa-nut trees, shaded sun; easily done digging towards them, watching water flows. Then, dig hole large enough sink earth one water-casks lie beach, I bring afternoon; then, fixed earth way, shall always cask full water use, spring filling fast empty it." "I understand," replied Mr Seagrave; "that shall task absent." "Now, I nothing speak Juno dinner," replied Ready; "and I will take mouthful, off." Ready directed Juno fry pork frying-pan, cut slices turtle, cook turtle-steaks dinner, well warm soup left; then, biscuit piece beef his hand, he went boat set cove. Mr Seagrave William worked hard; and, twelve of the clock, hole quite large deep enough, according directions Ready given. They left work went tent. "You do not know much happier I I here," said Mrs Seagrave, taking her husband's hand, he seated her. "I trust presentiment future happiness, dear," said Mr Seagrave. "I assure I feel same, saying Ready morning." "I feel I could live ever, calm beautiful; I miss one thing--there birds singing home." "I seen birds except sea-birds, plenty. Have you, William?" "Only once, father. I saw flight long way off. Ready me, I could tell were; large birds, big pigeons, I think. There Ready coming round point," continued William. "How fast little boat sails! It long pull, though, old man he goes cove." "Let us go help Ready carry things dinner," said Mrs Seagrave. They so; William rolled empty water-cask Ready brought him. The turtle-steaks much approved turtle-soup; indeed, long salt meat, return fresh provisions delightful. "And finish well," said William, soon dinner over. "How hard work, William!" said his mother. "So I ought, mother. I must learn everything now." "And soon," said Ready. They rolled cask spring, and, astonishment, found great hole dug two hours quite full water. "Oh dear," said William, "we shall throw water get cask down." "Think little, William," said Mr Seagrave, "for spring runs fast easy task. Cannot something else?" "Why, father, cask float, know," replied William. "To sure is; way making sink?" "Oh yes. I know--we must bore holes bottom, fill sink itself." "Exactly," replied Ready. "I expected that, big gimlet me." Ready bored three four holes bottom cask, floated water ran it, degrees gradually sank down. As soon top cask level surface filled round spade shovel, well completed. CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR. The next morning, soon breakfast over, Mr Seagrave observed: "Now many things do, I think, Ready, ought lay plan operations; method everything work done: tell propose shall several occupations next week, to-morrow Sunday; although yet able honour day should, I think must ought keep holy." "Yes, sir," replied Ready. "To-morrow rest labour, ask God's blessing upon endeavours six days week; now, proposition, Mr Seagrave, shall begin first lady?" "You must consider ladies now, Ready," said Mrs Seagrave, "at least, fine ladies. My health strength recovering fast, I mean useful. I propose assist Juno domestic duties, cookery washing, look teach children, mend clothes, make required, best ability. If I I will." "I think may satisfied that, Mr Seagrave," replied Ready. "Now, sir, two pressing points, exception building house, dig piece ground, plant potatoes seeds; make turtle-pond, catch turtle put season over." "You right," replied Mr Seagrave; "but ought done first?" "I say turtle-pond, days' work you, Juno, William. I shall want assistance next week. I shall fix upon spot, far here, trees thickest grove, cut clear space will, by, build storerooms; and, soon rainy season gone by, remove stores side island. It occupy whole week, cutting trees sawing proper lengths, ready building house, must join strength get without delay." "Can really manage get time? How soon expect rains come on?" "In three four weeks. After next week, I shall probably assistance two you, all. Now I think it, I must return cove." "What for?" "Do not recollect, sir, two-wheeled carriage, packed matting, thrown shore gale? You laughed saw it, said would little use now; wheels axle useful, make wide path place I cut trees, wheel logs much easily drag carry them." "That excellent idea. It save great deal labour." "I expect will, sir. William I go away early Monday morning, back breakfast. To-day fix upon spots garden be, turtle-pond made, trees cut down. That shall business, Mr Seagrave; William Juno may put things little rights here." Mr Seagrave Ready walked beach, and, surveying reefs time, Ready said, "You see, Mr Seagrave, want much water turtle-pond, as, deep, difficulty catching want them: want space water surrounded low wall stones, animals cannot escape, cannot climb up, although walk shelving sand flippers. Now reef high water, space within reef beach deep enough, rocks beach nearly fill side prevent crawling away shore. We have, therefore, little fill two sides, pond complete." "I see long job either, find loose rocks enough," replied Mr Seagrave. "Almost beach loose," replied Ready, "and plenty close us: heavy carry, brought aid handspikes crowbars. Suppose make signal William Juno, set work." Mr Seagrave called waved his hat, Juno William came them. Juno ordered go back two handspikes, Ready explained William done. Having stayed assisted time Juno returned implements, Mr Seagrave Ready proceeded point, fix upon spot garden, leaving William Juno continue labour. CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE. Mr Seagrave Ready continued way along beach, arrived point latter considered convenient place make garden. They found sufficiency mould; point narrow joining mainland, great length enclosure would required. "You see, sir," said Ready, "we wait till rainy season put fence, prepare meantime, weather permit us work. The seeds potatoes come rains finished; dig ground, put fast can. We cannot make large garden year; potatoes must contrive get in, cannot manage anything else." "If fence make," replied Mr Seagrave, "I think shall able clear away quite enough ground week put require." "The first job pull small brushwood," said Ready, "and turn ground; larger plants must leave, time. Tommy might use taking away shrubs pull up; better go grove, choose spot cutting trees. I made mark." Ready Mr Seagrave proceeded direction former pointed out, arrived spot rising ground, trees thick easy pass them. "There place," said Ready. "I propose cut timber want houses part grove, leave open square place, centre build storerooms. You see, sir, necessary, little trouble might turn place protection defence, palisades trees would make it, call East Indies, stockade." "Very true, I trust shall require purpose." "I hope too, nothing like prepared; however, plenty think that. Now, sir, dinner ready, suppose return, dinner commence tasks." Juno William returned dinner Mrs Seagrave prepared. They warm work, hard, eager finish task. After dinner over, Mrs Seagrave requested her husband, he go point, spade small hatchet his hand, take Tommy him, she great deal do, could watch well baby Caroline. So Mr Seagrave took Tommy hand, led point, made sit close he cleared away brushwood. Mr Seagrave worked hard, he cut cleared portion ground, he made Tommy carry away little distance, pile heap, bushes he cleared away. When Mr Seagrave cleared away large piece ground his hatchet, he took his spade dig roots turn mould, leaving Tommy amuse himself. What Tommy hour, Mr Seagrave worked diligently, his father observe; sudden he began cry; his father asked reason, he answer, cried more, last he put his hands his stomach, roared lustily. As he appeared great pain, his father left work, led tent, Mrs Seagrave came out, alarmed his cries. Ready, heard Tommy screaming long while, thought might something serious, left his work ascertain because. When he heard passed, he said: "Depend upon it, child eaten something made ill. Tell me, Tommy, eat there?" "Berries," roared Tommy. "I thought much, madam," said Ready. "I must go see berries were." And old man hastened place Mr Seagrave work. In meantime Mrs Seagrave much alarmed lest child poisoned himself, Mr Seagrave went search among medicines castor-oil. Ready returned he came back tent bottle castor-oil, he told Ready he give Tommy dose. "Well, sir," replied Ready, plant his hand, "I do not think give any, appears he taken much already. This is, I recollect right, castor-oil plant, castor-oil beans Master Tommy eating. Tell me, Tommy, eat them?" "Yes," cried Tommy. "I thought so: give little warm drink, madam, he will soon better: teach eat berries beans again." What Ready said true; nevertheless Master Tommy ill whole day, put early bed. CHAPTER TWENTY SIX. The next day, Mr Seagrave, William, Juno, Ready work allotted tasks, Mrs Seagrave sitting front tent, little baby, Albert, crawling close her, Caroline trying work her needle, Tommy making holes ground, putting small stone hole. "What doing, Tommy?" said Mrs Seagrave. "I am making garden," replied Tommy. "Making garden! Then ought plant trees it." "No; I am sowing seeds: look here," replied Tommy, pointing stones. "But stones, seeds." "Well, I pretend, that is thing," replied Tommy. "Not exactly, Tommy; suppose, instead eating beans yesterday, pretended eat them, would not better?" "I will not eat more," replied Tommy. "No, beans; saw anything else thought would like, I afraid would eat it, ill even worse were." "I like cocoa-nuts; do not some? there is plenty upon trees." "But climb high, Tommy? Can you?" "No; do not Ready climb, papa, William?" "I suppose get by, busy, time now." "I like turtle-soup," replied Tommy. "William Juno making pond put turtle in, shall oftener; cannot everything like wish it." "I like fried fish," said Tommy; "why do not fried fish?" "Because every one busy catch now. Tommy, go bring brother Albert back; he crawled near Billy, he butts sometimes." Tommy went baby, crawling towards kid, grown pretty large, he took his brother he kicked goat's head. "Do not that, Tommy; he will butt you, hurt you." "I do not care," replied Tommy, holding baby one hand he continued kick Billy. Billy, however, would stand it; he lowered his head, made butt Tommy, he Albert rolled ground one other. The baby roared, Tommy began whimper. Mrs Seagrave ran caught baby; Tommy, alarmed, caught hold his mother's dress protection, looking behind Billy, appeared inclined renew attack. "Why do not mind said you, Tommy? I told he would butt you," said Mrs Seagrave, pacifying child. "I do not care him," replied Tommy, perceived goat walking away. "No, brave he gone; you are naughty boy mind said you." "Billy never butts me, mamma," said Caroline. "No, dear, tease him; brother fond teasing animals, he gets punished frightened. It wrong so, especially he told his father he ought not." "You said I good boy I learnt lesson morning," replied Tommy. "Yes, always good," replied his mother. "I cannot always good," said Tommy; "I want dinner." "It dinner-time, Tommy, certain, must wait come home work." "There is Ready coming, bag his shoulder," replied Tommy. Ready soon came Mrs Seagrave sitting, laid bag. "I have brought young cocoa-nuts, old ones also, trees I cutting down." "Oh! cocoa-nuts--I like cocoa-nuts!" cried Tommy. "I told you, Tommy, by, come sooner thought. You warm, Ready." "Yes, madam," replied Ready, wiping his face; "it rather warm work, breeze grove cool one. Is anything want side island, I shall go directly dinner?" "What for?" "I must bring wheels get timber out; I must clear away I go, path finished. I must William help me." "William like trip, I doubt. I recollect anything particular want, Ready," replied Mrs Seagrave. "There he comes Juno, I see Mr Seagrave laid his spade; Caroline, dear, take care Albert, I get dinner them." Ready assisted Mrs Seagrave, dinner spread ground, brought chairs tables new residence, thought could without till house built. William reported Juno he would turtle-pond complete next day. Mr Seagrave cleared sufficient ground plant half-sack potatoes saved, day two would able put strength upon cutting drawing timber. After dinner, William Ready set boat, and, dark, returned wheels axle carriage, several articles make load. CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN. "Now, William," said Ready, "if sleepy, perhaps would like come to-night, see cannot turn turtle, season going away fast, leave island soon." As soon sun disappeared, William Ready went beach, sat quietly rock. In short time, Ready perceived turtle crawling sand, and, desiring William follow without speaking, walked softly water's edge, get animal sea. As soon turtle perceived them, made water, met it; Ready, seizing hold one fore-flippers, turned back. "You see, William, way turn turtle: take care he catch his mouth, for, he did, he would bite piece out. Now animal cannot get away, he cannot turn again, shall find to-morrow morning; walk along beach, see cannot find more." Ready William remained till past midnight, turned sixteen turtle. "I think do, William, once: made good night's work it, provided food many days. Tomorrow must put pond." "How shall carry large animals?" "We need carry them; must put old canvas them, haul along means; easily smooth sand." "Why do not catch fish, Ready? We might put turtle-pond." "They would stay long, William, could easily get did. I often thought getting lines ready, yet time never come, I feel sleepy day's work; soon house built, them, shall fisherman-in-chief." "But fish bite night, not?" "Oh yes, better daytime." "Well, then, get line show how, I fish hour work done; I know mamma getting tired salt meat, think good Caroline." "Well, then, I get bit candle to-morrow night, fit two fishing-lines. But I must go you, William. We do not use much candle, events." "No, glad go bed: two three boxes one sort another cove." The next morning breakfast hands employed getting turtle pond. After breakfast, William Juno finished pond walls raised high enough; and, returned dinner, reported task completed. Mr Seagrave also said he had, he thought, cleared quite ground enough present; Mrs Seagrave wanted Juno help her wash linen afternoon, agreed William, Ready, Mr Seagrave go garden, put potatoes. Ready worked spade, Mr Seagrave William cut potatoes pieces, eye piece. When finished work, Mr Seagrave said--"Now finished cutting potatoes, let us go assist Ready planting seeds brought us." CHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT. That night Ready sat two three hours working candle-light (William keeping company), busily engaged fitting fishing-lines leads hooks. At last two complete. "What bait must use, Ready?" "I think best would one fish shells sand; piece pork fat will, I dare say, well." "And whereabouts would fish, Ready?" "The best place, I think, would farthermost end point, I got boat reef--the water deep close rocks." "I thinking, Ready, gannets men-of-war birds would good eating." "Not very, William; tough fishy: must try get nothing better. Now got seeds potatoes, must set to-morrow morning fell carry timber. I think Mr Seagrave better use axe me; Juno can, I shown how, hang timber axle, wheel place decided upon building house. And better go bed." William, however, made his mind otherwise: he knew his mother would glad fish, he determined, moon shone bright, try he could catch he went bed; he waited quietly till he thought Ready asleep well others, went lines, went beach, he picked three four shells, and, breaking two pieces rock, took fish baited his hooks. He walked point. It beautiful night; water smooth, moonbeams pierced deep surface. William threw his line, soon lead touched bottom he pulled foot, Ready instructed him; he held his line half minute, jerked forcibly, expecting he nearly hauled water; was, fish strong line slipped his hand scored his fingers; time he able pull in, he landed beach large silver-scaled fish, weighing nine ten pounds. As soon he dragged far away edge rocks prevent flapping water again, William took hook determined try another. His line short time before, jerked violence; William time prepared, he let line played fish till tired, pulled up, found second fish even larger first. Satisfied his success, he wound his lines, and, running piece string gills fish, dragged back tents, hanged pole, fear dogs eating them; he went in, soon fast asleep. The next morning William first up, showed his prizes much glee; Ready much displeased him. "You wrong, William, run risk did. If resolved catch fish, tell me, I would gone you? You say, yourself, fish nearly hauled water; suppose done so, suppose small shark instead one gropers (as call them) taken bait, must jerked in; rocks steep there, would able get shark hold you. Think moment would distress father agony despair poor mother, news arrived." "I wrong, Ready," replied William, "now I think it; I wanted surprise please mother." "That reason almost sufficient plead pardon, dear boy," replied Ready; "but do not again. And let us say it; nobody know danger, there is harm done; must not mind old man scolding little." "No, indeed, Ready, I not, I thoughtless; I idea danger." "There is mother coming her tent," replied Ready. "Good-morning, madam. Do know William done last night? Look, two beautiful fish, excellent eating are, I tell you." "I quite delighted," replied Mrs Seagrave. Tommy clapped his hands danced about, crying, "Fried fish dinner;" Juno said, "Have fine dinner to-day, Missy Caroline." After breakfast set grove, Ready cutting trees, taking wheels axle, couple stout ropes. Mr Seagrave Ready cut trees slung axle, Juno William dragged spot house built. They sorry dinner ready, hard work. That night, tired were, Ready William went out, turned eight turtle. They continued felling cocoa-nut trees dragging timber remainder week, considered nearly enough, Tuesday morning commenced building house. CHAPTER TWENTY NINE. Ready cut prepared door-posts window-frames timber he towed round cove. He fixed four poles earth upright corner, then, assistance Mr Seagrave, notched every log cocoa-nut wood sides, meet one crossing it, that, laying log upon log alternately, fitted pretty close, chinks filled cocoa-nut leaves twisted tight, forced them: work William Juno logs ready carrying; and, degrees, house rose foundation. The fireplace could made once, either find clay, burn shells lime build rocks mortar; space left it. For three weeks worked hard: soon sides up, got whole roof rafters; then, broad leaves cocoa-nut trees cut down, Ready thatched strong securely. At end three weeks house secure weather; quite time, weather begun change, clouds gathered thick, rainy season commencing. "We time lose, sir," said Ready Mr Seagrave. "We worked hard, must days work harder still. We must fit inside house, enable Madam get soon possible." The earth inside house beaten hard, make floor; sort bedstead, two feet ground, running whole length house, raised side interior: fitted canvas screens let night. And Ready William took last trip boat fetch chairs tables, coming first storm season. The bedding utensils taken house; little outhouse built cook in, fireplace could made. It late Saturday night family shifted new house; fortunate occasion delay, Sunday first storm burst upon them; wind blew great force; and, although shielded it, still cocoa-nut trees ground sawed other's stems bent heads force. The lightning vivid, thunder appalling, rain descended continual torrent. The animals left pastures, sheltered grove; and, although noonday, dark could see read. "This, then, rainy season talked about, Ready," said Mrs Seagrave. "Is always like this? If so, shall do?" "No, madam; sun shine sometimes, long time. We shall able get something every almost every day, still shall rain, perhaps, many days without intermission, must work indoors." "How thankful ought house heads; drowned tents." "That I knew, madam, therefore I anxious get house head; let us thank God it." "Indeed ought," observed Mr Seagrave; "and is, indeed, time us read service." The morning service performed new house. Violent rain was, penetrate thatch put on. Ready William went secure boat, afraid would injured, returned wet skin. The storm continued without intermission whole night, slept dry safe; and, awakened noise thunder pelting rain, thanked God found dwelling wilderness upon cast. CHAPTER THIRTY. When rose next morning, clouds cleared off, sun shining bright. Ready Juno first house--Ready telescope his arm, he always took he went his rounds, he termed it, morning. "Well, Juno," said Ready, "this fine morning rain." "Yes, Massa Ready, fine morning; I get fire light, make kittle boil breakfast, I really do not know--stick cocoa-nut trash wet." "Before I went bed last night, Juno, I covered embers ashes, put stones them, cocoa-nut branches, I think find fire yet. I going morning's round, I stay little help you." "Tank you, Massa Ready; plenty rain fell last night." "Yes, little, Juno; must expect find water well clear morning; indeed, I doubt see well all. Here is stuff wet." "I got plenty fire, too," replied Juno, removed branches stones, her knees blowing embers. "You will well now, Juno," said Ready; "besides, William directly--so I will leave you." Ready whistled dogs, came bounding out, set his round inspection. He first directed his steps well ravine; but, instead gushing spring limpid clear water, cask sunk well filled, muddy torrent, rushing ravine, well covered it, distinguished. "I thought much," said Ready, musing impetuous stream; "well, better much water little." Ready waded through, he wished examine turtle-pond, side stream. Finding right, he crossed water, spread wide sandy beach, he came point he moored his boat, head stern, rope, heavy stone made fast it, anchor. From point, usual, he surveyed horizon his telescope; he thought chance vessel arriving among islands; but, still, possible, he took trouble; never except he went morning alone, he aware circumstance his would make Mr Seagrave melancholy unsettled. As usual, he dropped telescope his arm, his survey, saying himself, "Little use that." The gale blown offshore, boat dragged her moorings, far Ready could get her. "Here is puzzle," said old man; "how foolish made line fast shore! I will trust John Shark swimming boat." "Let see." Ready took halyards sheets belonging boat's sails, he left beach, bent one he sufficient length rope. He made piece wood, two feet long, fast middle end rope, and, one two attempts, contrived throw boat. The piece wood caught one thwarts, enabled draw boat shore. Having baled water fallen her storm, he landed examined garden. "Now find sheep goats," said Ready, "and morning's walk over. Now, Romulus, now, Remus, boys, find out," continued he; dogs, appeared know he search of, went away pursuit, soon found sheep two goats, third goat them. "Why, Black Nanny be?" muttered Ready, stopping little while; last he heard bleat, small copse brushwood, he directed his steps, followed dogs. "I thought much," said he, he perceived Nanny lying copse two new-born kids her side. "Come, little fellows, must find shelter you," said he, taking one arm. "Come, Nanny." Ready walked back house, brought kids, followed Nanny. He found Mr Mrs Seagrave children dressed. Caroline Tommy gave scream delight saw little kids, even little Albert clapped his hands. As soon Ready put ground, Tommy Caroline arms round one. "I have brought addition family, Mrs Seagrave," said Ready: "we must allow remain house I knock little shelter them. This beginning; I expect shall soon more." As soon children could persuaded part kids, Nanny tied corner, content fondling nursing her progeny. Juno William brought breakfast, soon over, Mr Seagrave said, "Now, Ready, I think must hold council, make arrangements allotted duties employments rainy season. We great deal do, must idle." "Yes, sir, great deal do, and, get work, must order method doings. I have lived long enough know much done regularity discipline. Why, sir, work got men well-conducted man-of-war merchant service double time. And so? Because everything place, place everything." "I agree you," said Mrs Seagrave; "method everything. While one careless little girl looking her thimble, another finished her work." "I assure I never known done order arrangement, I pressed board man-of-war. I found everything done silence. Every man his post; everyone rope haul upon, rope let go; boatswain piped, seconds every sail set taken required. It seemed first like magic. And observe, Mr Seagrave, order discipline, every man becomes individual importance. If I learnt nothing else board man-of-war, I learnt make time, strength could command." "You right, Ready; must teach us same," replied Mr Seagrave. "We much do, I hardly know begin; yet, sir, must work present can, can, got things little better order. We done well present." "What think ought first?" "Well, sir, first job haul boat secure her harm; half-dock her sand, cover her over, I think safe go her side island, sea always rough." "There I perfectly agree you. Now next?" "Why, sir, must leave tents are, take down, soon dry, stow away, may want by; then, sir, must build large outhouse stores provisions, thatched roof, floor raised four feet ground; then, floor, sheep goats protection weather. Then fish-pond make, also salt-pan cut rock. Then two long jobs. One is, go woods examine stores left side island, sort arrange ready bringing rains over; must also explore island little, find produces; present know nothing it: may find great many things useful us, great many trees fruits, I hope trust may able find grass live stock." "I agree say, Ready," replied Mr Seagrave; "now shall divide strength?" "We divide present, sir, please. Juno plenty indoors Mrs Seagrave; William, you, I, first secure boat stow away tents gear; that, set outbuilding, work can. If Juno time spare, she better collect cocoa-nut leaves, pile fuel; Tommy will, I dare say, go her, show her draw along." "Yes, I will show her," said Tommy, getting his feet. "Not now, Tommy," said Ready, "but soon mamma spare her go you. Come, sir, hours weather like lost," continued Ready; "we shall rain day over, I expect. I first go tent shovels; I haul boat round beach meet there. You William take cord, tie large bundle cocoa-nut boughs, sling wheels, draw beach meet me." CHAPTER THIRTY ONE. As many cocoa-nut trees cut build house, plenty boughs lying every direction, William Mr Seagrave soon procured sufficient. In short time boat drawn ten yards water's edge, Ready said quite sufficient; dug shovels boat sunk half sand. Having filled sand round her her gunnel, boat carefully covered boughs, weighed sand might blown away. "I do not see cover boat way, Ready; rain will not hurt her," observed William. "No, sir, rain will not her harm, sun will, bursts occasionally; it is powerful shine, would split her pieces." "I forgot that," replied William. "What shall now?" "Suppose, two hours dinner-time, run lines, William, we will try fish." "We cannot three us fish two lines," said Mr Seagrave. "No, sir; William knows catch them, suppose remain him, I go collect wood chips Juno's fire. She hard pressed morning, wet; but, piled up, soon dry. Be careful, Mr Seagrave, hold lines tight hands, may jerked water." Mr Seagrave William fortunate; two hours expired caught eight large fish, brought house slung boat-hook. Tommy hallooed loudly fish dinner, caught many, agreed dinner put could got ready, sorry eat instead salt pork. They hardly sat table, rain came pattering roof, quarter hour storm violent, thunder lightning terrific day before. All outdoor labour suspended. Mrs Seagrave, Juno, Caroline took work, plenty needle thread, Ready soon found employment rest. William Mr Seagrave unlaid thick rope, Ready might make smaller useful rope yarns. Ready took his sailing needles, worked eyelet-holes canvas screens (which put hurry), might drawn fro required. As soon Ready hung curtains, he looked bedsteads large bundle, said, he opened it, "I shall decorate Madam Seagrave's sleeping-place. It ought handsomer others." The bundle composed ship's ensign, red, large, square, yellow flag name ship _Pacific_ large black letters upon it. These two flags Ready festooned tied round bed-place, give gay appearance, also hide rough walls cottage. "Indeed, Ready, I much obliged you," said Mrs Seagrave, he finished; "it really quite grand place." "It is best use put now, madam," said Ready. "I afraid so," replied Mr Seagrave, thoughtfully. "Ready," said William, candles lighted, "you half-promised would tell history; I wish would tell us now, pass away evening." "Well, William, I say so, I shall keep word. When heard story, say I foolish time; I have; proves warning you, will, events, use." Ready commenced his history follows: HISTORY OF OLD READY. "Of course, wish know father mother were: soon told. My father captain merchant vessel, traded South Shields Hamburg, poor mother, God bless her, daughter half-pay militia captain, died two months marriage. The property old gentleman bequeathed mother added father already vested brig, he owned one-third vessel; two-thirds property rich ship-builder owner, name Masterman. What profits share he held vessel his pay captain, father well do. Mr Masterman, high opinion father, gained much money his exertions good management, present marriage, I born, year afterwards, he stood godfather. Every one considered advantageous circumstance me, congratulated father mother; Mr Masterman bachelor, nearly sixty years, without near relations. It true, he fond money; that, said, better, he could take away he died. An end, however, soon put worldly ideas, year I born, father drowned sea, his vessel whole her crew lost Texel sands; mother found herself widow, child scarcely weaned, she twenty-two years age. "It supposed mother would still sufficient live upon, ship insured two-thirds her value; but, astonishment everybody, Mr Masterman contrived make appear his two-thirds vessel insured." "What insurance?" inquired William. "Insurance, dear boy, paying certain sum people called underwriters, case vessel cargo lost damaged, loss damage made good owners vessel cargo. You pay proportion risk incurred. Supposing wished insure one thousand pounds vessel cargo, ten per cent required, would, vessel came home safe, pay underwriters one hundred pounds; if, contrary, vessel lost, underwriters would pay one thousand pounds, sum insured. I beg pardon interruption, Ready." "No need, Mr Seagrave; never lose opportunity teaching young. Well, far assertion Mr Masterman correct not, impossible time say; I know everybody cried `shame', he deprive widow, he much answer for; Bible says, `Pure religion visit fatherless widows affliction, keep unspotted world'. The consequence was, mother little nothing live upon; she found friends assisted her, she worked embroidery, contrived get somehow I eight nine years age." "But godfather come forward assistance mother?" inquired Mr Seagrave. "No, sir, strange say, he not; made people talk more. I believe abuse him, he fail hear, he ascribed mother, turned away us; perhaps his conscience, always dislike injured." "Unfortunately, great truth remark yours, Ready," observed Mr Seagrave; "still, strange he something." "It strange, sir,--at least, appeared time, he fond money, irritated reports observations made him. But, go on, sir, I strong, hardy boy, and, whenever I could escape mother school, always found water-side board vessels. In summer-time I half day water, good swimmer. My mother perceived fondness profession, tried she could divert thoughts way. She told dangers hardships sailors went through, always ended father's death flood tears. "We certainly perverse nature, I often heard clergyman say, appears always wish told do. If mother always persuading going sea, I really believe I might stayed home. I have often thought since, selfish unfeeling I must been. I young know pain I giving mother, anxiety preying upon her, account. Children cannot feel it; did, would otherwise, hearts seldom hard grow older." "I agree you, Ready," said Mr Seagrave. "If children really knew much parents suffer behave ill, alarmed proofs wickedness them, would much better." "We never find out, sir, till late," continued Ready. "Well, sir, I little nine years old, when, windy day, water rough, hawser, vessel fast wharf, carried away violent jerk, broken part, flew out, struck person edge wharf, knocked sea. I heard crying out, men wharf ships throwing ropes him, he could catch hold them; indeed, he could swim well, water rough. I caught rope hauled again, leapt wharf. "Young I was, I swam like duck, put rope his hands he going down. He clung drowning men cling, hauled piles, soon afterwards boat, lowered stern one vessels, picked us up. We taken public-house, put bed till dry clothes could sent us; I found person I saved godfather, Mr Masterman. Everyone loud praise; and, although perhaps I ought say it, bold act young boy I was. The sailors took home mother sort triumphal procession; she, poor thing, she heard I done, embraced again, one moment rejoicing preservation, next weeping bitterly thoughts danger I encountered, probability bold spirit would lead still greater." "But she blame done?" "Oh no, William; she felt I done duty towards neighbour, perhaps she felt her heart I returned good evil; she say so. The next day Mr Masterman called upon us; he certainly looked foolish confused he asked his godson, he long neglected. My mother, felt useful he might me, received kindly; I often told his neglect mother, his supposed unfair conduct towards father, taken violent dislike him; his advances towards therefore coolly received. I felt glad I saved him; although I could exactly understand feelings time, I ashamed say pleasure derived done good action, much indulging feeling revenge put one obligation treated ill; arose proud spirit, mother could check. So see, William, little merit I done, as, I done it, I indulged feelings I ought checked." "I think I could helped feeling same, Ready, circumstances," replied William. "The impulse induced act good," replied Ready; "but feeling I indulged afterwards took away whole merit deed. I stating I believe truth; old man like look upon past without bias, without regret. Mr Masterman made short visit; he told mother he would take care bring business ship-builder soon I old enough leave school, meantime he would pay expenses. My poor mother grateful, she would tears joy; Mr Masterman went away, she embraced me, said she happy, I profession shore go sea. I must justice Mr Masterman; he kept his word sent money mother, she became quite cheerful comfortable, everyone congratulated her, she used fondle me, say, she relieved her distress." "How happy must made you, Ready!" said William. "Yes, did, made also proud. Strange say, I could conquer dislike Mr Masterman; I nourished feeling long. I could bear mother obligations him, he pay schooling; hurt foolish pride, young I was; although mother happy, I not. Besides, I put better school, obliged remain boys, I could longer run wharfs, go board vessels, before. I see then, I now, good I became discontented unhappy, merely I obliged pay attention learning, could longer way. The master complained me; Mr Masterman called scolded well. I became disobedient, I punished. This irritated me, I made mind I would run away sea. You see, William, I wrong; boys think know better charge them; see I probably lost foolish conduct. I say _probably_, one calculate foresee take place; but, far appearances went, I every prospect receiving good education--of succeeding Mr Masterman his business, and, probably, inheriting his large fortune; I might time rich well-educated man, surrounded comforts luxuries life; perhaps amiable wife large family round me, make still happier, instead I am, poor, worn-out old seaman upon desert isle. I point you, William, show one false foolish step young may affect whole prospects life; and, instead enabling sail stream prosperity, may leave struggle current adversity, case me." "It is, indeed, good lesson, Ready," said Mr Seagrave. "It is; I repine lot, even I regret errors led it. An all-wise gracious God disposes us he thinks best; I say perfect sincerity, `Thy will, mine, done'." "Your misfortunes have, however, proved incalculable benefit us, Ready," observed Mrs Seagrave; "for gone sea, board ship crew deserted us, would become us?" "Well, madam, comfort think worn-out old seaman like use." CHAPTER THIRTY TWO. The bleating kids woke next morning earlier usual. The weather fine, sun shining brightly, Ready turned Nanny her progeny. They excellent breakfast fried fish, Mr Seagrave, Ready, William went work: two first took tents, spread canvas ground, might well dried, William went pursuit fowls, seen day two. After half-an-hour's search cocoa-nut grove, he heard cock crow, soon afterwards found all. He threw split peas, he brought him. They hungry enough followed home house, he left went join Ready his father. "William," said Ready, "I think, spread tents, will, Mr Seagrave approves, set knock fowl-house; will not day's job, creatures home. There four thick cocoa-nut trees close house; build them; good job over." Mr Seagrave assented, set immediately work. There many thin poles left, tops cocoa-nut trees cut build house; nailed trunks four trees, make square, ran rafters pitched roof. "Now, sir, rough work; first put perch two them, close side, thatch roof cocoa-nut branches; there is Juno taking dinner, we will finish afterwards." After meal work renewed; Mr Seagrave collected branches William Ready worked upon sides roof, evening closed in, fowl-house complete. William enticed fowls split peas, walked away. "Now, sir, creatures soon find way in; by, I time, I will make door entrance." "And now," said William, "I think better roll canvas tents; splendid day, may fortunate to-morrow." "Very true; get housed, stow away bed-places; plenty room." By time folded canvas, William brought Nanny kids, sun set, went house. Ready requested go his history, he follows:-- "I said last night I determined run away school go sea, I tell I managed it. I chance getting school unperceived, except boys put bed. The room I slept top house--the doors I knew locked; trap-door led roof, fastened bolt inside, ladder leading it; I determined I would make escape way. As soon boys fast asleep, I arose dressed quietly, left room. "The moon shone bright, lucky me, I gained trap-door without noise. I difficulty forcing up, heavy boy age; I contrived last, gained roof house. I began looking me, see I get ground, walking fro several times, I decided I could slip large water-pipe; far detached bricks, I could get small fingers round it. I climbed parapet, and, clinging pipe firmly hands knees, I slid down, arrived bottom safety." "It is wonder break neck, Ready," observed Mrs Seagrave. "It was, indeed, madam. As soon I landed flowerbed, below, I hastened iron gates entrance, soon climbed got side road. I started fast I could towards port, I arrived wharf, I perceived vessel her topsails loose, meant take advantage ebb-tide made; men singing `Yo heave yo,' getting anchor up; I stood watching, almost making mind I would swim her, I perceived man pushed her jolly-boat, sculling post little higher up, hawser made fast; I ran round, arrived he cast rope; without saying word, I jumped boat. "`What want, youngster?' said seaman. "`I want go sea,' said I, breathless; `take board--pray do.' "`Well,' said he, `I heard captain say he wanted apprentice, may come.' "He sculled boat back vessel, I climbed her side. "`Who you?' said captain. "I told I wanted go sea. "`You little young.' "`No, I not,' replied I. "`Why, think dare go aloft?' "`I will show you,' replied I; I ran rigging like cat, went topgallant yard-arm. "When I came down, captain said, `Well, I think you will make sharp seaman by; I will take you, and, soon I get London, I will bind apprentice.' "The ship, collier, soon port, day dawned I found wide ocean, hereafter home. "As soon hurry confusion over, I examined captain, appeared rough, harsh man; indeed, day I almost repented step I taken, I sat cold wet upon old sail night, thoughts mother, distress I occasion her, first time rushed mind, I wept bitterly; late then. I often thought, Mr Seagrave, life hardship I since gone judgment cruelty mother, leaving her way I did. It broke her heart; poor return, William, her care kindness! God forgive me!" Old Ready left little time, remainder party kept silence. Then he said--"I will leave now, please: I do not feel inclined go on; heart full I recall foolish wicked deed mine." CHAPTER THIRTY THREE. The next morning fine, soon breakfast over, took wheels turtle-pond, Ready speared one largest means pike barb it, he made purpose, hauled shore, slung wheels, took house. Having killed turtle, cut up, Juno, directions Ready, chose portions required soup; pot fire, Ready, Mr Seagrave, William set cross-cut saw hatchets, commence felling cocoa-nut trees building outhouse, hold stores, soon could brought round side island. "I mean place refuge case danger, sir," observed Ready; "and therefore I selected thick part wood, far house, cutting path zigzag, quite hidden sight; must make path wide enough allow wheels pass, stump roots trees obliged cut down, otherwise stumps would attract attention." "I agree you, Ready," replied Mr Seagrave; "there saying may happen." "You see, sir, often custom natives, part world, come canoes one island another, merely get cocoa-nuts. I cannot say islands near us inhabited, still probable, cannot tell character people may be. I tell this, better say word Mrs Seagrave, may distress her." Mr Seagrave agreed, Ready continued: "We near spot, sir. You see, got hill, trees thick, fall ground assist concealment building. I say near right stand." "How far house? We must distant." "I reckon 150 yards straight line, although road will, turning, make double distance." "Then I think spot well." "I will mark trees stand, Mr Seagrave, cut down, leave four feet stump standing." As soon planned building, axes saw full use, tree tree fell one upon other. They worked hard till dinner-time, sorry prospect sitting rich mess turtle-soup. "My dear William, too, Mr Seagrave, warm are!" said Mrs Seagrave; "you must work hard." "Cutting trees warm work, mother," replied William, "and hard work never hurt one, especially he dines turtle-soup. Why, Tommy, what is matter you?" "Tommy I variance," replied Mrs Seagrave. "I thimble morning, commenced sewing, I called Juno, Caroline went me, Tommy left house. When I came back I found outside, going back work, thimble found; I asked he touched it, his answer he would look it. He look, said he could find it; I asked several times he took away, his answer he find by." "Tommy, take thimble?" said Mr Seagrave, gravely. "I will find by, papa." "That is answer. Did take thimble?" "I will find by, papa," said Tommy, whimpering. "That is answer he give me," said Mrs Seagrave. "Well, then, he shall dinner till thimble makes appearance," replied Mr Seagrave. Master Tommy began cry intelligence. Juno appeared turtle-soup; Tommy cried louder said grace commenced dinner. They hungry, William sent his plate another portion, he commenced long he put his finger his mouth pulled something. "Why, mother, here is thimble soup," cried William. "No wonder he said he would find by," said Ready, smiling; "he meant fished up, I suppose, left soup dinner. Well, Mrs Seagrave, I do not mean say Tommy good boy, still, although he would tell thimble was, he told falsehood it." "No, he not," replied William. "I think, thimble found, he begs pardon, papa forgive him." "Tommy, come here," said Mr Seagrave. "Tell put thimble soup?" "I wanted taste soup. I wanted fill thimble; soup burnt fingers, I let thimble drop in." "Well, thimbleful was not much, events," observed Ready. "And did not tell mamma thimble was?" "I afraid mamma throw soup away, I get none dinner." "Oh! it, it? Well, sir, I said dinner till thimble found, so, found, may dinner; ever refuse answer question again, I shall punish severely." Tommy glad lecture over, glad get his turtle-soup; he finished one plate, and, he asked another, he said, "Tommy will not put thimble again; put tin pot next time." After dinner went work again, come till sunset. "The clouds gathering fast, sir," observed Ready; "we shall rain to-night." "I fear shall; must expect now, Ready." "Yes, sir; shall days together." "Ready," said Mrs Seagrave, "if tired, perhaps go history." "Certainly, madam, wish it," replied Ready. "When I left off, I board collier, bound London. We fair wind, quick passage. I sick arrived Nore, I recovered, and, may suppose, astonished busy scene, quantity vessels going river. But I like captain; he severe brutal men; apprentice board told run away, get another vessel, bind apprentice captain, I beat day long, treated bad he was. I knew case, captain kicked cuffed twenty times day. The men said he me, fear I refuse his apprentice; that, soon indentures signed, he would treat way. "Well, I made mind I would remain collier; and, captain gone shore, I plenty time look me. There large ship, ready sail, lying stream; I spoke two boys stairs her boat, told comfortable board, captain wanted two three apprentices. I went board them, offered myself. The captain asked great many questions, I told truth, I like remain collier. He agreed take me; I went shore him, signed indentures, received sufficient supply clothes; and, two days afterwards, sailed Bombay China." "But wrote mother, Ready, not?" said William. "Yes, I did; captain desired so, he put lines bottom comfort her; but, unfortunately, letter, sent shore cook, never arrived. Whether he dropped it, forgot till ship sailed, tore up, I know; but, I found afterwards, never get her hands." "It fault letter arrive safe," said Mrs Seagrave. "No, madam, fault; fault committed before." "Do not dwell upon portion history, Ready; tell us took place sailed East Indies." "Be so, please. I certainly smart active age, soon became great favourite board, especially lady passengers, I little fellow. We arrived safely Bombay, passengers went shore, three weeks afterwards sailed straits China. It war time, often chased French privateers; good crew plenty guns, none ventured attack us, got safe Macao, unloaded cargo took teas. We wait time convoy, sailed England. When Isle France, convoy dispersed gale; three days afterwards, French frigate bore upon us, exchanging broadsides, compelled haul colours. A lieutenant sent board forty men take charge us, rich prize them. The captain crew taken board frigate, ten Lascars boys left Indiaman, assist taking her Isle France, time hands French. I thought hard I go prison twelve years old; I care much it, soon I gay merry ever. We made island, wind beating port, vessel seen windward, although I could understand Frenchmen said, I perceived great fluster busy spy-glasses, Jack Romer, one brother 'prentices three years sea, said me, `I do not think we will go prison all, Ready, vessel English man-of-war, I am mistaken.' At last she came within three miles us, hoisted English colours fired gun. The Frenchmen put ship wind, use; man-of-war came us fast, Frenchmen began pack clothes, together things collected property captain crew; shot fired went clean heads, left helm, Jack Romer went it, and, help, hove ship wind; boat came board took possession, one escape, events. "They sent midshipman prize-master board vessel, left us, taken prisoners French, vessel, help work her port, captain wish part men his necessary. We soon made sail England, quite delighted escaped French prison, but, all, exchanged Dutch one." "How mean?" "I mean that, two days afterwards, rounding Cape, another French vessel bore upon us, captured us. This time find friend need, taken Table Bay; time Cape Good Hope possession Dutch, who, well French, war England." "How unfortunate were, Ready!" said Mrs Seagrave. "Yes, madam, were, I cannot say much favour Dutch prison. However, I young time, care much--I light heart." CHAPTER THIRTY FOUR. A heavy storm came soon retired rest; lightning vivid flashes penetrated chinks door windows, thunder burst upon noise prevented obtaining sleep. The children cried trembled lay arms Mrs Seagrave Juno, almost much alarmed themselves. "This awful," said Mr Seagrave Ready, risen beds. "It indeed, sir; I never knew terrible storm this." "Merciful Heaven!" exclaimed Mr Seagrave. As he spoke, thrown back half-stunned; crash thunder burst house, shook everything it; sulphurous smell pervaded building, soon afterwards, recovered feet, perceived house full smoke, heard wailing women shrieks children bed-places side. "God mercy us!" exclaimed Ready, first recover himself, attempted ascertain injury done: "the lightning struck us, I fear house fire somewhere." "My wife--my children!" exclaimed Mr Seagrave; "are safe?" "Yes, yes!" cried Mrs Seagrave, "all safe; Tommy come me; Juno? Juno!" Juno answered not. William darted side house, found Juno lying her side, motionless. "She dead, father," cried William. "Help carry her house, Mr Seagrave," said Ready, lifted poor girl; "she may stunned." They carried Juno house, laid her ground; rain poured torrents. Ready left minute, ascertain house fire; he found flames corner, rain extinguished it. He went back Mr Seagrave William, Juno. "I attend girl, sir," said Ready; "go Master William house; Mrs Seagrave much frightened she left alone awful time. See, sir! Juno dead--her chest heaves--she come soon; thank God it!" William Mr Seagrave returned house; found Mrs Seagrave fainting anxiety fear. The information brought, Juno killed lightning, much restore her. William soothed little Albert, Tommy minutes fast asleep his father's arms. The storm abated, day began break, Ready appeared Juno, sufficiently recovered able walk his support; she put her bed, Ready Mr Seagrave went examine mischief done. The lightning come end house, part fireplace intended made. "We mercifully preserved," said Mr Seagrave. "Yes, sir, thanks God his goodness," replied Ready. "I think large roll copper wire, Ready; not?" said Mr Seagrave. "Yes, sir, I thinking myself; lightning-conductor first thing." It broad daylight. Mrs Seagrave dressed herself children, soon she ready, Mr Seagrave read portions Psalms appropriate, earnestly joined prayer thankfulness humility. William went prepare breakfast, Ready procured coil copper wire stores stowed bed-places. This he unrolled, stretched straight, went ladder, outhouse commenced building. As soon breakfast over, Ready Mr Seagrave went fix lightning-conductor, leaving William work Juno, still remained fast asleep her bed. "I think," said Ready, "that one two trees close together suit best; near house, yet quite near enough wire attract lightning." "I agree you, Ready; must leave standing." "No, sir, shall require get fix wire; cut other." Ready put his ladder one trees, and, taking hammer bag large spike-nails, drove one nails trunk tree till deep enough bear his weight; he drove another it, he continued do, standing upon one he drove another above, till he reached top tree, close boughs; he descended, and, leaving hammer behind him, took saw small axe, ten minutes he cut head cocoa-nut tree, remained tall, bare pole. "Take care, Ready, come down," said Mr Seagrave anxiously. "Never fear, sir," replied Ready; "I am young I was, I often mast-head, much higher this." Ready came again, cut small pole, fix thick piece pointed wire top it, head cocoa-nut tree. He went up, lashed small pole head tree, made end copper wire fast pointed wire, he descended. The tree near cut down, lower end wire buried ground bottom tree lightning-conductor fixed. "That is good job done, sir," said Ready, wiping his face, he warm work. "Yes," replied Mr Seagrave; "and must put another near outhouse, may lose stores." "Very true, sir." "You understand this, William, do not you?" said his father. "O yes, papa; lightning attracted metal, strike point instead house, run wire, tear ground below." "It is coming again, sir, thick ever," observed old man; "we shall work to-day, I am afraid. I will go see stock are." Juno again, said she quite well, exception headache. As Ready predicted, rain came great violence, impossible work doors. At request William he continued his narrative. NARRATIVE OF OLD READY. "Well, William, soon let go anchor Table Bay, ordered shore, sent prison close Government Gardens. We carefully watched, appeared impossible us get away, I must say well treated every respect; told sent Holland first man-of-war came bay, much like idea. "There were, I told you, boys well myself, belonged Indiaman, kept much together, age, shipmates long. Two boys, one I mentioned Jack Romer, Will Hastings, particular friends; one day, sitting wall warming ourselves, winter time, Romer said, `How easy would us get away, knew go to!' "`Yes,' replied Hastings; `but go to, Hottentots wild savages; get there, do?--we cannot get further.' `Well,' said I, `I would rather living free among savages, shut prison.' That first talk subject, many others afterwards; one two Dutch soldiers stood sentry spoke English, could talk little Dutch, obtained good deal information them; often sent frontiers colony. We continued ask questions, talk among two months, last resolved would make escape. We done much better remained were; putting old heads upon young shoulders. We saved provisions, bought long Dutch knives, tied clothes bundles, one dark night contrived remain yard without perceived, prisoners locked up; raising long pole, lay yard, top wall, good deal scrambling contrived get it, made fast could Table Mountain." "What reason going there, Ready?" "Why, Hastings, oldest, and, I say, sharpest three, said better stay days, till made minds do, try could procure musket two, ammunition; for, see, money, as, Indiaman first taken, captain divided keg rupees, board, among officers men, proportion wages due them, thinking better crew money leave Frenchmen; spent little prison. There also another reason he persuaded us go Table Mountain, was, soon escape found out, would send parties look us; thinking, course, made interior; less chance retaken travelled first search over. The soldiers told us lions, wild animals, dangerous travel, Hastings said, finding us, would suppose destroyed wild beasts, would look us more." "Foolish indeed," observed Mrs Seagrave, "to set knew where, country full wild beasts savages." "True enough, madam," replied Ready. "We ran first breath, walked fast could--not going right mountain, keeping slanting direction south-west, get away town, towards False Bay. "We walked four hours, began feel tired, day dawned, looked place conceal in. We soon found cave narrow entrance, large enough inside hold half-a-dozen lads were, crawled in. It quite dry, and, tired, lay heads bundles, intending take nap; hardly made comfortable shut eyes, heard screaming barking frightened lives almost. We could think could be. At last Hastings peeped out, began laugh; Romer I looked also, saw one hundred fifty large baboons leaping tumbling way I never saw; bigger were--indeed, stood hind legs much taller, large white tusks. Some females, young ones backs, active males. At last played antics, burst loud laugh, ceased found grinning face one largest brutes close own. He dropped rock us, like magic. We three backed cave, much frightened, teeth animal enormous, he looked savage. He gave shrill cry, perceived rest herd coming fast could. I said cave large enough hold six us; sort inner cave gone into, entrance much smaller. Romer cried out, `Let us go inside cave--we get one one;' he backed in; Hastings followed his bundle, I hurried time; baboons, chattering half minute, came outer cave I crawled inner. Five six came in, males, large. The first thing lay hold Romer's bundle, soon opened--at seized his provisions rammed pouches, pulled things tore pieces. As soon done bundle, two came towards inner cave saw us. One put his long paw seize us; Hastings gave slash his knife, animal took his paw fast enough. It laughable see hold his hand others, taste blood tip his tongue, chattering I never heard--they evidently angry, came cave joined them; another put his hand, received cut before. At last, two three tried pull us out, beat knives, wounding severely. For hour continued attempts, went away cave, remained mouth shrieking howling. We began tired work, Romer said he wished he back prison again; I, I assure you; getting out, gone animals would torn us pieces. We agreed chance animals becoming tired going away; anxious were, excitement made us thirsty, wanted water. We remained two hours way imprisoned baboons, sudden shrill cry given one animals, whole herd went galloping fast could, screaming louder ever. We waited short time see would return, Hastings crawled first, looking cave cautiously, said gone, he could see nothing Hottentot sitting watching cattle; therefore came out, happy release. That first adventure; plenty afterwards; I think time go bed. It opinion shall fine day to-morrow, sir; there is saying." "I want hear happened afterwards, Ready," said William. "Well, shall; there is time everything, bed-time, unless like go me; weather cleared up, I want catch fish two to-morrow." CHAPTER THIRTY FIVE. As Ready predicted, weather set fine violent storm made mention. For fortnight, little intermission, continued fine, time, Ready, Mr Seagrave, William worked daylight till dusk storehouse, anxious complete, tired work over, even William ask Ready go his history. At last storehouse complete, thatched wattled three sides, leaving one open ventilation; lower part, arranged folding stock night rainy season, also wattled cocoa-nut boughs three sides, made comfortable retreat animals. The winding path storehouse also cut cocoa-nut grove, stumps removed, could spare time. All stores brought round put storehouse, ready take job. It was, however, agreed that, day building finished, day's holiday, certainly require. William caught fish, turtle speared wheeled house; holiday, feast. Mr Seagrave William walking beach Mrs Seagrave children, Ready assisting Juno cutting turtle; shown Mrs Seagrave storehouse, goats four kids led there, longer occasion remain house. The weather beautiful, agreed go examine garden. They found seeds yet commenced sprouting, notwithstanding heavy rains. "I thought much rain would made come up," said Mrs Seagrave. "No, dear," replied Mr Seagrave; "they require sun till rainy season nearly over; days like this, soon above-ground." "Let us sit knoll, quite dry," said Mrs Seagrave. "I little thought," continued she, "that I could happy desert island. I thought I feel loss books severely, I really think I could found time read." "Employment source happiness, especially usefully employed. An industrious person always happy person, provided he obliged work hard; even unhappiness, nothing makes forget soon occupation." "But, mamma, shall always much now," said William. "Of course not," replied Mr Seagrave; "and shall find books great source enjoyment. I anxious go side island, see spared us, whether much damaged; cannot rains over, use boat again. "Look minute insect crawling finger," said Mr Seagrave, turning William: "what number legs has!" "Yes, I seen something like old books. How fast runs little legs; thinner hairs--how wonderful!" "Yes, William," replied Mr Seagrave, "we examine portion, however small, creation, immediately filled wonder. There nothing points us immensity omniscience Almighty careful provision made Him smallest insignificant created beings. This little animal perhaps one many millions, term existence, enjoyment, well have. What it?--an insect minutest kind, nothing creation; yet care bestowed upon formation: little legs, hardly visible, muscles sinews; every portion body complete, fearfully wonderfully fashioned, own. Such his will; insects ought feel ourselves, compared God power love!" "Let also point you, William," continued Mr Seagrave, "the infinity his creative power, displayed endless variety. Amongst millions men born, died, ever yet seen two faces two bodies exactly alike; nay, could examine leaves upon trees, although may millions upon millions forest, could discover two leaves precisely form make." "I often tried vain," replied William; "yet animals much alike, I cannot perceive difference them--sheep, instance." "Very true; cannot tell difference, examined them; shepherd, he seven hundred sheep his care, know every one others; proves must great difference them, although perceptible casual observer; same, doubt, case classes animals." "Yes, William," observed Ready; "I often wondered things I seen, I even ignorance felt papa told you; brought mind words Job: `When I consider, I afraid him.'" "Papa," said William, pause conversation, "you referred variety--the wonderful variety--shown works Deity. Tell prominent feature creation." "One remarkable, William, order." "Point me, papa, quality observable." "Everywhere everything, dear boy; whether cast eyes heavens us, penetrate bowels earth, principle order everywhere--everything governed fixed laws, cannot disobeyed: order seasons, tides, movement heavenly bodies, instinct animals, duration life assigned each; elephant lives century, ephemeral fly, whose whole existence limited hour. "Inanimate nature subject unvarying laws. Metals, rocks, earths, mineral kingdom follow one law crystallisation, never varying form assigned them; atom depositing allotted place, form complete: order production, order decay; simple planets thrown space, commanded roll eternal orbits." "Yes; stars heavens beautiful," said William, "but placed order." "The fixed stars appear us order--that is, stud heavens equal distances view them; must recollect different distances earth, spreading infinity space; reason suppose earth mere unit multitude created worlds, one single portion infinite whole. As stars appear us, useful mariner, enabling cross trackless seas; astronomer, calculates times seasons." "What mean, papa, saying world supposed one multitude created worlds?" "Our little knowledge bounded earth, ascertained satisfactorily one several planets revolving round sun. I say sun, every reason suppose fixed stars, myriads visible naked eye, suns, bright glorious own, course throwing light heat upon unseen planets revolving round them. Does give idea vastness, power, immensity God?" "One almost loses one's self imagination," said Mrs Seagrave. "Yes," replied Mr Seagrave; "and surmised some, felt hearts magnificence Great Architect, must point view space glorious suns, seem us confused heavens us, appear symmetrically arranged, viewed regular order, whirling round one stupendous perfect system beauty design; be, heaven hope gain?" There silence moments, William said, "They say people atheists, papa. How look around them? I sure mere examination works God ought make good Christians." "No, child," replied Mr Seagrave; "there error. Few deny existence Deity, examination his works may make good devout men, Christians. There good men found every denomination, whether Jews, Mahomedans, Pagans; Christians." "Very true, papa." "Faith things seen, I may use term, dear child, may induce men acknowledge power goodness Almighty, make wise salvation; end, necessary, Apostle saith, faith things seen." CHAPTER THIRTY SIX. "Well, Ready," said Mr Seagrave, breakfast, "which next job?" "Why, sir, I think better set to, collect branches ends cocoa-nut trees cut down, stack fuel. Tommy Juno already made good large pile, I think, to-night, shall made stack, arranged rain get much. After that, weather permit us leave house time, cut salt-pan make fish-pond; take week least, shall little near home. I think strength rains already, perhaps fortnight may venture walk wood, examine saved wreck." "And explore island; not, Ready?" said William. "I long that." "Yes, William, must almost last job; shall away two three nights, perhaps, must look fine weather. We will, however, bring stores round boat." "But make salt-pan, Ready? We must cut solid rock." "Yes, William; I three four call cold chisels, one hammer, shall get faster think; coral rock, although hard surface, soft little it." The whole day employed piling cocoa-nut branches wood. Ready made square stack, like haystack, gable top, he tied long branches, rain would pour it. "There," said Ready, he came ladder, "that provision next year; quite enough left go till rainy season over, shall difficulty collecting afterwards weather dry." Mr Seagrave sighed looked grave; Ready observed it, said, "Mr Seagrave, may want it; still must prepare next rainy season, case want it. That Captain Osborn, he lives, send look us, I doubt; nay, I believe Mackintosh same; still must forget may perished, although mercifully preserved. We must put trust God, sir." "We must, Ready; his will, must murmur. I schooled much possible; thoughts come spite endeavours restrain them." "Of course will, sir; that is natural: however, sir, must hope best; fretting good, sinful." "I feel is, Ready; I see patient, even happy, wife privations, I angry myself." "A woman, sir, bears adversity better man. A woman love, she her husband children her, good health, she make herself happy almost anywhere: men different: cannot bear shut world now." "It ambition makes us unhappy, Ready," replied Mr Seagrave; "but let us say it: God must dispose he thinks fit." After supper, Ready, requested William, continued his narrative. "I left off, I recollect right, William, Hottentot, cattle his care, frightened away baboons tormenting us. Well, came cave sat rock, Hottentot could see us, sort council war. Romer going back giving again; he said ridiculous wandering without arms defend wild beasts, might fall something worse baboons soon; he right. It would wisest thing could done; Hastings said, went back laughed at, idea laughed made us agree would not. Bear mind, William, never let fear ridicule induce wrong; done wrong, prevent returning duty." "Many thanks advice, Ready; I hope William forget it," said Mr Seagrave. "Well, sir, reason giving mad scheme; decided, next point consultation us was, procure arms ammunition, could without. As talking over, I peeped behind rock see Hottentot might be; I perceived he laid down, wrapped his kross, mantle sheep-skins always wear. Now observed he carried his musket his hand, first saw him, Hottentots always go armed, I pointed Hastings Romer he asleep, might get possession his musket without his perceiving it. This good idea, Hastings said he would crawl his hands knees, remained behind rock. He cautiously, found man's head covered his kross fast asleep; fear, Hottentots hard wake time; knew well. Hastings first took musket carried away reach Hottentot, he returned him, cut leather thong slung his powder-horn ammunition, retreated without disturbing man his sleep. We quite overjoyed piece good luck, determined walk cautiously distance Hottentot lay, case he awoke he see us. Keeping eyes every direction, lest meet anybody else, proceeded nearly mile towards Table Bay, fell stream water. This another happy discovery, thirsty; concealed near stream quenched thirst, made dinner provisions brought us." "But, Ready, wrong steal Hottentot's musket?" "No, William; instance could considered theft. We enemy's country, trying escape; therefore much war country took us prisoners, stole musket could said stolen ship. Am I right, Mr Seagrave?" "I believe justified may seem extreme acts recovery liberty, made prisoners. It always considered." "Well, sir, go on: waited till dusk, continued march towards False Bay fast could. We knew farmers valley, rather sides hills, hoped obtain, means other, two muskets. It near twelve of the clock night, bright moon, sight water False Bay, soon afterwards heard baying large dog, far us distinguished two three farmhouses, cattle-folds orchards. We looked hiding-place, might remain till morning; found one large pieces rock. We agreed one watch two slept; Hastings undertook do, he inclined sleep. At daylight he woke Romer me, made breakfast. From place concealed in, bird's-eye view farmhouse, going on. "The farmhouse buildings us much smaller two, distant. We watched people went about. In hour Hottentots came out, perceived yoking oxen waggon; yoked twelve pair, Hottentot driver got drove towards Cape Town. Soon that, another Hottentot drove cows valley feed; Dutch woman came house two children, fed poultry. "We watched another hour, farmer made his appearance, pipe his mouth, sat bench. When his pipe out, he called house, Hottentot woman came tobacco light. During whole day see people house, concluded farmer, his wife, Hottentot woman, two children. About two hours noon farmer went stable led his horse, mounted, rode away; saw speak Hottentot woman he rode off, she soon went valley basket her head, long knife her hand. Then Hastings said time moved, one woman house, could easily overpower her get wanted; still great risk, she might give alarm, escape day-time, might seen taken prisoners again. However, chance, resolved go farmhouse cautiously, ready seize opportunity. We crept hill, gained fence, back farmhouse, without discovered: remained quarter hour, when, great joy, observed farmer's wife go house, leading child hand; apparently she going visit one her neighbours, she went direction one farms. As soon she hundred yards off, Hastings crept softly fence, entered farmhouse back-door; he came again, made sign us come in. We found already possession rifle musket, hanging fire-place, soon handed powder-horns ammunition pouches, hung different part room, away fire-place. "Having gained these, Hastings set watch front door, lest anybody return, Romer he looked something else way provisions. We got possession three hams, large loaf bread big small washing-tub. With articles made way safe back retreat. We looked round, could see nobody direction, presumed discovered. As sort ravine full rocks dividing hill, obliged pass could get valley, unless went close farmhouse, agreed would better cross day-time, get difficulty over, and, time, farmhouse. We so; found secure hiding-place, lay down, waiting sun set started journey interior. I think I better leave now, William, getting late." CHAPTER THIRTY SEVEN. The fishpond commenced next morning. Ready, Mr Seagrave, William went together beach, and, much examination, chose spot one hundred yards turtle-pond eligible purpose; water shallow, part farthest shore would three feet. "Now, sir," said Ready, "this simple job; collect small rocks stones, pile wall-fashion inside, slope outside, break force waves water little rough; course, water find way stones, constantly changed. It is true, times catch fish want them, always spare time, it is well always certain quantity hand, take moment's warning; can, course, catch put nothing else do. Juno able come take spear, away she wants something dinner." "But stones here, Ready; shall fetch long way," said William. "Well, then, William, let us get wheels here, carry quantity time." "But shall carry them, Ready?" "We sling tub axle; I go get ready bring down; meantime, Mr Seagrave collect stones near hand." Ready soon returned wheels, tub slung rope axle, means found could collect stones fast; Mr Seagrave William bringing them, Ready water, building wall. "We quite forgot another job must put hand, sir," observed Ready; "but fish-pond reminds it." "What that, Ready?" "A bathing-place children, indeed us all; shall want hot weather comes on, put till then. I tell you, sir, although I do not mind building wall shallow water, I shall careful water knees, do not know bold sharks latitudes. When I St. Helena, long ago, melancholy proof it." "Tell us story, Ready." "Well, two soldiers standing rocks St. Helena; rocks water, swell broke them. Two sharks swam them, one them, blow his tail, turning round way, tripped one water, deep. His comrade much frightened, ran barracks tell story. About week afterwards, schooner Sandy Bay, side island, people seeing large shark stern, put hook piece pork, caught him; opened him, found inside him, horror, whole body soldier, except legs knees: monster swallowed whole, exception his legs, nipped closed jaws." "I really idea bold, Ready." "It fact, I assure you; therefore cannot careful go water: saw soon poor pig despatched." "I wonder pigs get on, Ready," said William. "I dare say littered time, sir; want food." "But eat cocoa-nuts?" "Not old ones, young ones, constantly dropping trees, there is plenty roots them. If stay long shall soon good sport hunting them; must careful; although tame pigs brought shore, wild savage short time." "How must hunt them?" said Mr Seagrave. "Why, sir, dogs, shoot them. I glad Vixen pups soon; shall want dogs." "Shall mouths find food for?" "Never fear that, sir, long sea fish in. Dogs live well upon fish, even raw." "We shall lambs soon, Ready, shall not?" "Yes, sir, I expect soon. I wish food animals: put rather hard now; next year, find food island, must keep grass near home, make hay stack winter time--or rainy season rather, winter latitudes. I am pretty sure shall find clear land south island, cocoa-nut grove extend close water side north." "I long go exploring party," said William. "We must wait little," replied Ready; "but I do not know whether go; must three go once, leave Mrs Seagrave alone." "No," replied Mr Seagrave, "that would fair; either I must remain, William." William made reply, evident he annoyed idea party. They worked hard day, walls rose fast water. After supper, Ready continued his narrative. "We remained concealed dark, Hastings Romer, musket his shoulders ham his back; I, smallest, rifle great loaf bread, set journey. Our intention travel north, knew road leading colony; Hastings decided first go eastward, make sailors call circumbendibus, would keep us general track. We passed deep sands False Bay, gradually ascended, getting among brushwood young trees; saw signs cultivation, pass one house left False Bay astern us. About twelve of the clock much fatigued, longed drink water, find any, although moon shone bright day. We distinctly heard, however, much like, howling cries wild beasts increased went on; still see any, comfort. At last tired sat ledge rock. We dared go sleep, remained till daylight, listening howling animals. We none us spoke, I presume Hastings' Romer's thoughts own, were, I would given great deal find safe sound within prison walls. However, daylight came last; wild beasts prowl more; walked till found stream water, sat took breakfast, courage revived, talked laughed walked on, done before. We began ascend mountains, Hastings said must Black Mountains soldiers talked us about. They desolate; night came collected brushwood, cut branches knives, might make fire, warm ourselves, scare away wild beasts, whose howling already commenced. We lighted fire ate supper; loaf half gone, hams well cut into--we knew, therefore, soon trust guns procuring food. As soon finished meal, lay fire, muskets loaded close us, ammunition placed danger. We tired soon fast asleep. It agreed Romer keep first watch, Hastings middle, I morning; Romer fell asleep, consequence was, fire kept up. It midnight I awakened something breathing hard face, I could recall senses open eyes, I found lifted waistband, teeth animal pinching flesh. I tried catch musket, I put wrong hand, laid hold still lighted brand fire, I darted animal's face; let drop directly, ran away." "What providential escape!" said Mrs Seagrave. "Yes, was, madam; animal hyena. Fortunately cowardly sort beast; still, lighted stick, would carried off, I small then, lifted I feather mouth. The shout I gave woke Hastings, seized his musket fired. I much frightened, may suppose. As Romer, he never woke till pushed hard, he completely knocked up. This affair, course, made us cautious, afterwards lighted two fires, slept them, one always remaining watch. For week travelled on, soon mountains, turned heads northward. Our provisions gone, one day without any; killed antelope called spring-bock, gave us provisions three four days: want game descended plain. I forgot mention, however, narrow escape had, left extensive forest side mountain. We walked till past noon, much tired; decided upon taking dinner large tree, threw shade. Hastings lying his back, his eyes looking upwards, he perceived lower branch tree panther, lay along it, his green eyes fixed upon us, ready spring; he seized his musket, fired without taking aim, time; ball entered stomach animal, and, appeared, divided back-bone. Down came beast, within three four feet lay, loud roar, immediately crouched spring upon Romer; could not, back-bone broken, power hinder quarters, raised fore quarters, dropped again. I never saw rage fury animal life. At first much frightened fire; but, perceiving beast could spring, Hastings snatched musket Romer shot head. "We obliged hunt livelihood, became bolder ever. Our clothes rags; plenty powder ammunition; hundreds hundreds antelopes gnus plain--indeed, sometimes impossible count them. But plentiful supply game greater danger, now, first time, heard roar lions every night. We made large fires keep off, often made us tremble came near us." "Did ever meet one day-time?" said William. "Yes, sir; often saw them, never attacked us, much afraid fire them. Once met one face face. We killed antelope called hartebeest, and, muskets shoulders, running secure it. Just came spot, heard roar, found ten yards lion, lying top beast killed, his eyes flashing fire us, half raising himself, ready spring. We took heels fast could. I never looked back till I breath: lion content running away, take trouble follow us. Well, sir, travelling, really hardly knew where, certainly northerly direction, three weeks, quite worn out: agreed done foolish thing, would gladly gone back again. For part, I declare I willing lie die, I could done, I became quite indifferent roaring lions, felt I glad one would made meal me. At length, one morning, fell party natives. They Karroo tribe, told us pointing themselves, saying, `Karroos', pointed us, said `Dutch'. We shot game, gave them, pleased much, remained us five six days. We tried signs inquire them, Dutch settlement there; understood us, said was, direction pointed us, north-east. We offered present would show us way. Two men agreed go us; rest tribe, women children, went southward. The next day arrived Dutch settlement three four farmhouses, called Graaff Reinet; I must leave now, past bed-time." CHAPTER THIRTY EIGHT. The construction fish-pond proceeded rapidly, third day nearly complete. As soon walls finished, Ready threw sand shingle, make part next beach nearly deep other; might sufficient water prevent gulls man-of-war birds darting down, striking fish. While Ready thus employed, Mr Seagrave William collected rocks, divide pond four parts, time allowing communication part. These inside walls, well outside, made sufficient width walk upon; means would fish within reach spear, case wished take out. The day pond completed weather changed. The rain poured great force, accompanied terrific thunder lightning, storms long continuance, commencement rainy season. In intervals fine weather caught great many fish, put pond, well stocked. But circumstance occurred, occasion great alarm all; was, one evening William taken shivering, complained much pain his head. Ready promised continue his narrative evening, William ill sit up. He put bed, next morning he violent fever. Mr Seagrave much alarmed, symptoms worse every hour; Ready, sat night, called Mr Seagrave house, said, "This bad case, sir: William working yesterday his hat off, I fear he struck sun." The poor boy many days great danger; cheerful house one gloom silence. How fervent morning evening prayers; often day his parents offer petition heaven dear boy's recovery. The weather became finer every day, almost impossible keep Tommy quiet: Juno went Albert every morning, kept her she cooked; and, fortunately, Vixen young ones, Juno could longer amuse them, she brought two puppies play with. As quiet, meek little Caroline, she would remain whole day holding her mother's hand, watching her brother, working her needle side his bed. Ready, could idle, taken hammer cold chisel make salt-pan, he worked portions day his services required indoors; he sat chipping away rock, his thoughts ever upon William, he dearly loved boy his amiable disposition his cleverness; many time day would he stop his work, tears would run his cheeks he offered his petition Almighty boy might spared his afflicted parents. And prayers heard, ninth day William pronounced Ready Mr Seagrave much less fever, shortly afterwards left altogether; he weak he could raise his bed two three days; till fortnight fever left he could go house. The joy expressed change took place may imagined: thanksgivings less fervent prayers. During his convalescence, nothing else do, Mr Seagrave Ready, went gladly work, determined, salt-pan finished, would make bathing-place. Juno came assistance, useful assisting drag wheels brought rocks stones; Tommy also brought down, he might way Mrs Seagrave Caroline watched invalid. By time William able go house, bathing-place finished, longer fear sharks. William came beach his mother, looked work done; he much pleased it, said, "Now, Ready, finished everything home present; explore island, go cove examine collection wreck." "Very true, William; weather fine, I think may venture upon one days more; till stronger." "I shall soon strong again, Ready." "I doubt it, William; good reason thank God, could ill spare you." "It is long since gone story, Ready," said William, taken supper; "I wish would now, I sure I shall tired." "With pleasure, William," replied Ready; "but remember I left off, memory none best?" "Oh, yes; recollect, arrived Dutch farmer's house, company savages, place called Graaff Reinet, I think." "Well then, Dutch farmer came he saw us coming, asked us were. We told English prisoners, wished give authorities. He took away arms ammunition, said he authority part, true enough; he said, `You will run away without arms ammunition, that is certain. As sending Cape, I may able months; wish fed well, must work well you are here.' We replied, glad make useful, he sent us dinner Hottentot girl. But soon found deal ill-tempered, brutal fellow; he gave us plenty hard work, means plenty food. He would trust us guns, Hottentots went cattle, he gave us plenty work house; last he treated us cruelly. When he short provisions Hottentots slaves, he good many, he would go farmers lived near him, shoot quaggas eat. Nobody Hottentot could live upon flesh." "What quagga?" "A wild ass, partly covered stripes, much zebra; pretty animal look at, flesh bad. At last he would give us nothing eat quaggas, Hottentots, he his family--for he wife five children--lived upon mutton flesh antelope, excellent eating. We asked allow us gun procure better food, he kicked Romer unmercifully, he could work two days afterwards. Our lives became quite burden us; employed day farm, every day he brutal towards us. At last agreed would stand longer, one evening Hastings told so. This put great rage, he called two slaves, ordered tie waggon wheel, swearing he would cut every bit skin his body, he went his house get his whip. The slaves hold Hastings, tying up, dared disobey master, he said us, `If I flogged way, us. Now's time; run back behind house, he comes whip, go seize muskets, always ready loaded. Hold bay till I get clear, get away somehow other. You must it, I sure he flog till I dead, he shoot you, runaway prisoners, he his two Hottentots day.' As Romer I thought probable, Hastings told us; Dutchman gone towards he tied up, fifty yards house, went in. The farmer's wife bed, addition her family, children cared for. We seized two muskets large knife, came Dutchman struck first blow rhinoceros whip, severe, took away poor Hastings' breath. We went up; he turned round saw us: levelled muskets him, he stopped. `Another blow, we will shoot you,' cried Romer. `Yes,' cried I; `we boys, you have Englishmen deal with.' When came up, Romer kept his piece levelled Dutchman, I passed him, knife cut thongs bound Hastings. The Dutchman turned pale speak, he frightened, slaves ran away. As soon Hastings free, he seized large wooden mallet, used driving stakes, struck Dutchman earth, crying out, `That flogging Englishman, rascal!' "While man lay senseless dead--I did not know time-- tied waggon wheels, returning house, seized ammunition articles might useful. We went stables, took three best horses Dutchman had, put corn sack them, took cord halters, mounted, rode away fast could. As knew pursued, first galloped away going eastward Cape; then, soon ground would show tracks horses' hoofs, turned round northward, direction Bushman country. It dark soon altered course; travelled night, although heard roaring lions distance, met accident. At daylight rested horses, gave corn, sat eat provision brought us." "How long farmer Graaff Reinet?" "Nearly eight months, sir; time could speak Dutch, could make understood Hottentots natives. While eating held consultation proceed. We aware Dutchmen would shoot us came us, would come strong force us; afraid killed man, so, would hang us soon got Cape; great loss know act. At last decided would cross country Bushmen, get sea-side, northward Cape. We determined would better travel night, would less fear wild beasts, seen; went fast asleep many hours. Towards evening, found water horses, fed again, proceeded journey. I will not tell passed every day fortnight, time pretty well killed horses, compelled stop among tribe Gorraguas, mild, inoffensive people, supplied us milk, treated us kindly. We adventures, nevertheless. One day passing tuft small trees, rhinoceros charged upon horse, narrowly escaped wheeling short round getting behind him; beast made without meddling us more. Every day used shoot animal other, provision: sometimes gnu, something antelope bull; times one antelope kind. "Well, stayed three weeks people, gave horses time refresh themselves; set again, keeping towards coast went southward, Gorraguas told us fierce native tribe, called Kaffers, northward, would certainly kill us went there. The fact is, know do. We left Cape without exact idea go to, like foolish boys were, became entangled difficulties every day. At last decided would better find way back Cape, deliver prisoners, tired fatigue constant danger. All afraid killed Dutch farmer Graaff Reinet, treated us brutally; Hastings said he care; his business, he would take his chance: bade adieu Gorraguas, turned horses' heads south-east, make sea go southward time. "I mention melancholy event occurred. Two days recommenced travels, passing high grass, stumbled lion, devouring gnu. Romer, happened ten yards foremost three, alarmed he fired animal, agreed never do, folly enrage powerful beast, party small. The lion slightly wounded; he gave roar might heard mile, sprang upon Romer, one blow his paw knocked saddle bushes. Our horses, frightened, wheeled round fled, animal evidently attack us. As was, he make one bound direction; could pull gone half mile; did, saw lion torn horse Romer ridden, dragging away carcass right sort canter, without apparent effort his part. We waited till he well off, rode back spot Romer fallen: soon found him, he quite dead; blow lion's paw fractured his skull. "I ought said Gorraguas told us travel night, day; done consequence advice. I believe good advice, notwithstanding unfortunate accident, found travelled night lions followed us whole time; indeed I often thought since altogether indebted his mercy ordereth things, heaven earth, escaped well did. Three days poor Romer's death first saw wide ocean again. We kept near coast, soon found could obtain supply game, fuel fires night, well could interior, agreed get away coast again. We dreary plain pass over, quite faint want food--for without nearly two days--when came upon ostrich. Hastings put his horse his speed, use--the ostrich ran much faster horse could. I remained behind, and, great joy, discovered his nest, thirteen large eggs it. Hastings soon came back, his horse panting wind. We sat down, lighted fire, roasted two eggs: made good dinner them, put four saddle-bows, continued journey. At last, one forenoon, saw Table Mountain, glad see seen white cliffs Old England. We pushed horses hopes comfortably prison night; when, neared bay, noticed English colours flying board vessels road. This surprised us much; soon met English soldier, told us Cape taken forces six months ago. This joyful surprise, may suppose. We rode town, reported main guard; governor sent us, heard story, sent us admiral, took us board his ship." CHAPTER THIRTY NINE. The next morning, particular work hand, Ready Mr Seagrave took lines add stock fish-pond. As weather fine cool, William accompanied them, he might benefit fresh air. As passed garden, observed seeds sown already sprung inch two ground, that, apparently none missed. While Ready Mr Seagrave fishing, William sitting near them, William said his father-- "Many islands near us inhabited; not, papa?" "Yes, near us, I believe. At events, I never heard voyagers mention seen inhabitants isles near suppose one be." "What sort people islanders seas?" "They various. The New Zealanders advanced civilisation. The natives Van Diemen's Land Australia portions degraded class--indeed, little better beasts field." "I seen them," said Ready; "and I think I mention people, numerous indeed, still like beasts field. I saw once; and, first, thought animals, human beings." "Indeed, Ready; may be?" "In Great Andaman Isles, mouth Bay Bengal. I anchored distress Port Cornwallis, morning anchored, saw black things going upon fours trees came water's edge. We got telescope, perceived men women, stood upright." "Did ever come contact them?" "No, sir, I not; I met, Calcutta, soldier had; one time East India Company intended making settlement island, sent troops there. He said caught two them; four feet high, excessively stupid shy; houses huts live in, pile bushes keep wind off." "Had arms?" "Yes, sir, bows arrows; miserably made, small, could kill anything small birds." "Where people come inhabited islands, papa?" "That difficult say, William; supposed become inhabited much way island been--that is, people canoes boats driven sea, saving lives effecting landing, done." "I believe that is truth," replied Ready; "I heard say Andaman Isles supposed first inhabited slaver full negroes, wrecked coast typhoon." "What typhoon, Ready?" "It much hurricane, William; comes India change monsoons." "But monsoons?" "Winds blow regular one quarter many months year, change round blow another long." "And trade-winds, I heard poor Captain Osborn talking left Madeira?" "The trade-winds blow equator, several degrees north south it, east west, following course sun." "Is sun produces winds?" "Yes, extreme heat sun tropics rarefies air earth turns round, trade-winds produced rushing less heated air." "Yes, William; trade-winds produce call Gulf Stream," observed Ready. "How that? I heard spoken of, papa." "The winds, constantly following sun across Atlantic Ocean, blowing east west, great effect upon sea, forced Gulf Mexico (where stopped shores America), many feet higher Gulf eastern part Atlantic. This accumulation water must course find vent somewhere, called Gulf Stream, waters poured out, running strong northward, along shores America, [westward] eastward, passing far Newfoundland, strength spent somewhere northward Azores." "The Gulf Stream, William," said Ready, "is always several degrees warmer sea general, is, say, owing waters remaining Gulf Mexico long, heat sun great." "What mean land sea breezes West Indies, hot climates, papa?" "It wind first blowing shore, blowing sea towards shore, certain hours day, regularly every twenty-four hours. This also effect heat sun. The sea breeze commences morning, afternoon dies away, land breeze commences, lasts till midnight." "There latitudes close trade-winds," said Ready, "where wind certain, ships becalmed weeks; crews exhausted water board, suffered dreadfully. We call Horse latitudes--why, I know. But time us leave off, Master William go house." They returned home, supper Ready went his narrative. "I left time I sent board man-of-war, I put books supernumerary boy. I board her nearly four years, sent port port, clime clime, I grew strong, tall lad, put mizen-top. I found comfortable. I duty, consequence was, I never punished; man may serve board man-of-war without fear punished, he his duty, duty hard either; like board merchant vessels, hands--there hard work. Of course, captains command men-of-war harsh severe; good fortune mild steady captain, sorry he obliged punish men, although he would overlook improper conduct. The thing source constant unhappiness was, I could get England again, see mother. I written two three letters, never answer; last I became impatient I determined run away first opportunity might offer. We stationed West Indies, I often consultations Hastings subject, he quite anxious get away I was; agreed would start together first opportunity. At last anchored Port Royal, Jamaica, large convoy West India ships, laden sugar, sail immediately. We knew could get board one, would secrete us time sailing, short-handed enough, men-of-war pressed every man could lay hands upon. There one chance, swimming board one vessels night-time, easy enough, anchored hundred yards ship. What afraid sharks, plentiful harbour. However, night convoy sail made minds would run risk, impatient escape care anything. It middle watch--I recollect it, shall recollect life, last night--that lowered softly bows ship, soon water struck one West Indiamen close us. The sentry gangway saw light water made swimming it, he hailed, course; gave answer, swam fast could; he hailed heard bustle, knew officer watch manning boat send us. I caught hold cable West Indiaman, climb it, I yards Hastings, I heard loud shriek, and, turning round, perceived shark plunging Hastings his jaws. I frightened, short time I could move: last I recovered myself, began climb cable fast I could. I time, another shark made rush me; although I clear water two feet, he sprung caught shoe heel, he took him. Fear gave strength, second two afterwards I hawse-holes, men board, looking bows, witnessed poor Hastings' death, helped board, hurried below, boat ship nearly alongside. When officer boat came board, told perceived us water, close vessel, sharks taken us down. As shriek Hastings heard people boat, officer believed case, returned ship. I heard drum beat quarters board man-of-war, might ascertain two men attempted swim away, minutes afterwards beat retreat, put D.D. name books, well poor Hastings." "What D.D. mean?" "D stands discharged service; D.D. stands dead," replied Ready; "and mercy Providence I so." "It miraculous escape indeed," observed Mr Seagrave. "Yes, indeed, sir; I hardly describe sensations hours afterwards. I tried sleep, could not--I agony. The moment I slumbered, I thought shark hold me, I would start shriek; I said prayers tried go sleep again, use. The captain West Indiaman afraid shrieks would heard, he sent tumbler rum drink off; composed me, last I fell sound sleep. When I awoke, I found ship weigh canvas set, surrounded hundred vessels; men-of-war took charge convoy, firing guns making signals incessantly. It glorious sight, bound Old England. I felt happy, I thought I would risk jaws another shark regained liberty, chance shore country, able go Newcastle see poor mother." "I afraid miraculous escape little good, Ready," observed Mrs Seagrave, "if got soon." "Indeed, madam, so; feeling first sight vessels weigh England produced upon me. I honestly say I better serious person. The next night, I hammock, I prayed fervently; happened good old Scotchman board, second mate, talked seriously me, pointed wonderful preservation, I felt it. It he first read Bible me, made understand it, and, I may say, become fond it. I duty passage home seaman mast, captain pleased me. The ship I bound Glasgow, parted company convoy North Foreland, arrived safe port. The captain took owners, paid fifteen guineas services voyage home; soon I received money, I set Newcastle fast I could. I taken place outside coach, I entered conversation gentleman sat next me. I soon found he belonged Newcastle, I first inquired Mr Masterman, ship-builder, still alive. He told he dead three months. `And he leave his money?' I asked, `for he rich, kin.' `He relations,' replied gentleman, `and he left his money build hospital almshouses. He partner his business latterly, he left yard stores him, I believe, he know leave to. There lad I knew certain he intended adopted made his heir--a lad name Ready; he ran away sea, never heard since. It supposed he lost prize, he traced far. Foolish boy he was. He might man fortune.' "`Very foolish indeed,' replied I. "`Yes; he harmed himself. His poor mother, doted upon him, soon she heard he lost, pined away degrees, and--' "`You do not mean say she dead?' interrupted I, seizing gentleman arm. "`Yes,' replied he, looking surprise; `she died last year broken heart.' "I fell back luggage behind me, fallen coach gentleman held me. He called coachman pull horses, took down, put inside; coach rolled on, I cried heart would break." Ready appeared much affected, Mr Seagrave proposed he leave his history present. "Thank you, sir, better; I feel old eyes dim tears, even now. It is dreadful thing after-life reflect upon, foolish conduct hastened death kind mother; was, William, I give truth advantage." CHAPTER FORTY. A mornings afterwards, Juno came breakfast six eggs her apron, she found hen-house. "Look, Missy Seagrave--fowls lay eggs--soon plenty--plenty Master William--make well again--and plenty chickens by." "You have not taken nests, Juno; you?" "No; leave one nest hen see." "Well, then, keep William, I hope, say, make strong again." "I getting quite strong now, mother," replied William; "I think would better leave eggs hens sit upon." "No, no, William; health consequence early chickens." For days Mr Seagrave Ready employed garden clearing away weeds, begun sprout along seeds sown; time William recovered fast. The two first days, Juno brought three four eggs regularly; third day none found. On fourth day hens appeared also laid, much surprise Mrs Seagrave; hens commence laying eggs usually continue. On fifth morning, sat breakfast, Master Tommy make his appearance, Mrs Seagrave asked he was. "I suspect, madam," said Old Ready, laughing, "that Tommy come either his breakfast his dinner to-day." "What mean, Ready?" said Mrs Seagrave. "Why, madam, I tell you. I thought odd eggs, I thought probable hens might laid astray; I went yesterday evening search. I could find eggs, I found egg-shells, hid cocoa-nut leaves; I argued, animal, supposing island, taken eggs, would careful hide egg-shells. So, morning, I fastened door hen-house, left open little sliding door, fowls go roost; then, up, I watched behind trees, saw Tommy come out, go hen-house. He tried door, finding fast, crept hen-house little sliding-door. As soon he I let slide, fastened nail; he is, caught his trap." "And shall he remain day, little glutton!" said Mr Seagrave. "Yes, serve right," replied Mrs Seagrave; "and lesson him." Mr Seagrave, Ready, William, usual, went work; Mrs Seagrave Juno, little Caroline, busy indoors. Tommy remained quiet hour, he commenced roaring; use, one paid attention him. At dinner-time he began roar again, little success: till evening door hen-house opened, Tommy permitted come out. He looked foolish; sat corner without speaking. "Well, Tommy, many eggs suck to-day?" said Ready. "Tommy will not suck eggs more," said urchin. "No, better not," replied Mr Seagrave, "or find, end, less eat, instead more, day." Tommy waited quietly sulkily till supper ready, he made lost time. After Ready continued his narrative. "I told you, William, I informed gentleman coach mother died broken heart, consequence supposed death. I agony I arrived Newcastle, I could ascertain facts connected her decease. When coach stopped, gentleman, remained outside, came coach door, said me, `If I mistake not, Masterman Ready, ran away sea; not?' `Yes, sir,' replied I, sorrowfully, `I am.' `Well, man,' said he, `cheer up; went away young thoughtless, certainly idea would distressed mother did. It going sea, report death, preyed much upon her mind; fault. You must come me, I something say you.' "`I call upon to-morrow, sir,' replied I; `I cannot anything I talk neighbours visit poor mother's grave. It true I intend distress mother; report death fault mine. But I cannot help feeling that, I thoughtless, she would still alive happy.' The gentleman gave his address, I promised call upon next morning. I went house mother used live in. I knew she there; yet I disappointed annoyed I heard merry laughter within. I looked in, door open; corner mother used sit, mangle, two women busily work; others ironing large table; cried me, `What want?' laughed me, I turned away disgust, went neighbouring cottage, inmates intimate mother. I found wife home, she know me; I told her I was. She attended mother her illness, till day her death; she told I wished know. It little relief mind hear poor mother could lived, she incurable cancer; time woman told I ever her thoughts, name last word her lips. She also said Mr Masterman kind mother, she wanted nothing. I asked her show mother buried. She put her bonnet, led grave, then, request, she left me. I seated mound turf covered her, long bitterly I weep her loss pray forgiveness. "It quite dark I left spot went back cottage kind woman attended mother. I conversed her her husband till late, then, offered bed, I remained night. Next morning I went keep appointment gentleman I met coach: I found brass plate door he lawyer. He desired sit down, he closed door carefully, asked many questions, ascertain I really Masterman Ready, he said he person employed Mr Masterman's death, he found paper great consequence, proved insurance vessel belonged father Mr Masterman, lost, made Mr Masterman's share only, upon father's well, Mr Masterman defrauded mother. He said he found paper secret drawer time Mr Masterman's death, mother dead, I supposed dead, he see use making known disagreeable circumstance; that, I re-appeared, his duty do, he would arrange matter me, I pleased, corporation town, Mr Masterman's property left trust build hospital almshouses. He said insurance vessel three thousand pounds, one-third vessel belonged father, thousand pounds due him, interest many years would increase two thousand pounds. This good news me, may suppose I readily agreed he proposed. He set work once, called together mayor corporation town, proved document, immediately agreed I entitled money, paid without contest. Thus see, Master William, new temptation thrown way." "How mean temptation? It surely fortunate, Ready," said William. "Yes, William, was, people say, fortunate, according ideas world; every one congratulated me, I inflated good fortune, I forgot promises amendment, vows leading good life, I made poor mother's grave. Now perceive I called temptation, Master William?" "My dear child," said Mr Seagrave, "riches prosperity world prove often greatest temptations; adversity chastens amends us, draws us God." "As soon money hands," continued Ready, "I began squander away manner folly. Fortunately, I received ten days, Scotch second mate came like guardian angel save me. As soon I made known taken place, he reasoned me, pointed I opportunity establishing life, proposed I purchase part vessel, condition I captain her. I liked idea much, convinced I making fool myself, I resolved take his advice; one thing restrained me: I still young, twenty years old; although I could navigate one time, I latterly paid attention. I told Sanders this, he replied, I would take first mate, difficulty would got over, he could navigate well, I could learn first voyage; arranged. "Fortunately, I spent one hundred pounds money. I set Glasgow company Sanders, he busied hard looking vessel would suit. At last, he found one ready launching, which, consequence failure house built, sold. He made inquiries, found likely purchase her--that safe respectable firm--he made proposal I take one-fourth share her, command her. As Sanders respectable, well known steady man, his recommendation attended far parties wished see speak me. They satisfied me, young I was, bargain made. I paid two thousand pounds share, soon vessel launched, busy Sanders, I chosen first mate, fitting her out. The house purchased her West India firm, ship course intended West India trade. I two three hundred pounds left, I paid share vessel, I employed purchasing venture account, providing nautical instruments, etcetera. I also fitted out, see, William, although Sanders persuaded rational, I still puffed pride idea captain ship; great rise one lad mizen-top man-of-war. I dressed smart--wore white shirts, rings fingers. Indeed, captain part owner fine vessel, I considered somebody, often invited table owners vessel. I well off, pay ten pounds month, independent venture might produce, quarter-share profits vessel. This may considered prosperous portion life; so, please, leave to-night, I may well tell last long." CHAPTER FORTY ONE. For several days after, employed clearing away stumps cocoa-nut trees winding path storehouse; soon work finished, Ready put lightning-conductor side storehouse, like one he put near cottage. They got work arranged rainy season. The ewes lambed, sheep goats began suffer want pasture. For week rain, sun burst powerfully; Ready opinion rainy season over. William become quite strong again, he impatient commence survey island. After great deal consultation, last settled, Ready William make first survey southward, return report discovered. This decided upon Saturday evening, Monday morning start. The knapsacks got ready, well filled boiled salt pork, flat cakes bread. They musket ammunition, blanket folded carry shoulders, might sleep night. Ready forget his compass, small axes, blaze trees went wood. The whole Saturday occupied making preparations. After supper, Ready said, "Now, William, start travels, I think I may well wind history. I have not great deal tell, good fortune last long; remaining long French prison, life one continued chapter bad worse. Our ship soon ready, sailed convoy Barbadoes. Sanders proved good navigator, him, arrived Barbadoes, I gained knowledge I required enable command navigate vessel. Sanders attempted renew serious conversation, property made vain; I felt I could without his assistance, I kept distance, assumed superior. This ungrateful return his kindness me; often case world. Sanders much annoyed, arrival Barbadoes, he told his intention quit vessel. I replied haughtily, he might he pleased; fact is, I anxious get rid him, merely I obligations him. Well, sir, Sanders left me, I felt quite happy his departure. My ship soon full cargo sugar board her, waited convoy England. When Barbadoes, I opportunity buy four brass guns, I mounted deck, good supply ammunition board. I proud vessel, she proved voyage fast sailer: indeed, she sailed better men-of-war convoyed us; I guns board, I considered quite safe enemies' privateers. While waiting convoy, expected fortnight, blew heavy gale, ship, well others, dragged anchors, driven Carlisle Bay. We obliged make sail beat bay again, still blowing fresh. What tired waiting long convoy, knowledge arriving West Indiamen would advantageous, I made mind that, instead beating bay again, I would run England without protection, trusting fast sailing vessel guns I board. I forgot time insurance vessel made England `sailing convoy,' sailing without would render insurance void, misfortune occurred. Well, sir, I made sail England, three weeks everything went well. We saw vessels, chase us could come us; running fair wind channel, I made sure port night, French privateer hove sight gave chase. We obliged haul wind, blowing fast, carried away main-top mast. This accident fatal; privateer came alongside us laid us board, night I French prison, and, I may say, pauper; insurance vessel void, sailed without convoy. I felt I one thank unfortunate position I in; events, I severely punished, I remained prisoner nearly six years. I contrived escape three four others; suffered dreadfully, last arrived England, Swedish vessel, without money, even clothes would keep weather. Of course, I nothing look berth board ship, I tried second mate, without success; I ragged looked miserable; I determined, I starving, go mast. There fine vessel port; I went board offer myself; mate went captain, came deck, he Sanders? I hoped he would remember me, he immediately, held his hand. I never feel ashamed life I then. Sanders perceived it, asked cabin. I told happened, he appeared forget I behaved ill him; he offered berth board, money advance fit out. But he would remember conduct, I could forget it, I told so, begged his forgiveness. Well, sir, good man, long he lived, friend. I became his second mate he died, intimate. My misfortunes humbled me, I read Bible him; I have, I trust, done ever since. When he died, I continued second mate time, displaced. Since that, I always common seaman board different vessels; I well treated respected, I may add, I unhappy, I felt property would led follies, made forget, world live prepare another. Now, William, history Masterman Ready; I hope portions may prove useful you. To-morrow must betimes, breakfast early together, why, I think sooner go bed better." "Very true," replied Mr Seagrave, "William, dear, bring Bible." CHAPTER FORTY TWO. They early next morning, breakfasted early hour. The knapsacks guns, requisites journey, prepared; William Ready rose table, taking affectionate leave Mr Mrs Seagrave, started journey. The sun shining brilliantly, weather become warm; ocean distance gleamed brightly, waters danced, cocoa-nut trees moved branches gracefully breeze. They set high spirits, called two shepherd dogs, driven back Vixen, would joined party, passed storehouse, ascending hill side, got hatchets ready blaze trees; Ready set his course his pocket compass, fairly way. For time continued cut bark trees hatchets, without speaking, Ready stopped look his compass. "I think wood thicker ever, Ready," observed William. "Yes, sir, is; I suspect thickest part it, right middle island; however, shall soon see. We must keep little away southward. We better get fast can. We shall less work by, talk better." For half-an-hour continued way wood, and, Ready observed, trees became distant other; still, however, could see anything stems cocoa-nuts. It hard work, chopping trees every second, foreheads moist exertion. "I think better pull minutes, William; tired." "I used exercise, Ready, therefore I feel more," replied William, wiping his face his handkerchief. "I like stop minutes. How long think wood?" "Not half-an-hour more, sir, I think; even that, perhaps." "What expect find, Ready?" "That is difficult question answer. I tell I hope find, is, good space clear ground beach wood, may pasture sheep goats; perhaps may find trees besides cocoa-nuts: present, know, seen castor-oil beans, Tommy took dose of. You see, William, saying new seeds may brought birds, winds waves." "But seeds grow?" "Yes, William; I told seeds may remain hundreds years under-ground, come afterwards exposed heat." They continued way, walked quarter hour, William cried out, "I see blue sky, Ready; shall soon out; glad shall I be, arm aches chopping." "I dare say does, sir. I glad are, I am tired marking trees; however, must continue mark, shall find way back want it." In ten minutes clear cocoa-nut grove, found among brushwood higher heads; could see far shore. "Well," said William, throwing his hatchet, "I am glad that is over; let us sit little go further." "I am opinion, sir," replied Ready, sitting side William; "I feel tired to-day I first went wood, set cove. I suppose it is weather. Come back, dogs; lie down." "The weather fine, Ready." "Yes, is; I meant said rainy season trying health, I suppose I recovered yet. You regular fever, and, course, feel strong; man may fever, yet his health suffer great deal it. I old man, William, feel things now." "I think go on, Ready, better dinner; us good." "Well, take early dinner, shall get rid one bottle water, events; indeed, I think that, must go back way came, may well leave knapsacks everything guns trees; I dare say shall sleep too, I told Mr Seagrave positively expect us back to-night. I like say mother, she anxious you." They opened knapsacks, made meal, two dogs coming share; started discoveries. For ten minutes continued force way thick high bushes, till last broke clear them, looked around short time without speaking. The sea half mile distant, intervening land clear, fresh blades grass bursting earth, composing fine piece pasture least fifty acres, broken small patches trees brushwood; sandy beach, rocks rose sea twenty thirty feet high, one two places covered something looked white snow. "Well, Ready," said William, "there want pasture flock, even increases ten times number." "No," replied Ready, "we fortunate, great reason thankful; exactly required; let us go little, examine patches wood, see are. I see bright green leaf there, which, eyes fail me, I seen many time before." When arrived clump trees Ready pointed out, he said, "Yes, I right. Look there, banana; bursting now, soon ten feet high, bearing fruit excellent eating; besides stem capital fodder beasts." "Here plant I never saw before," said William, pulling piece it, showing Ready. "But I have, William. It call bird's-eye pepper; make Cayenne pepper it. Look, pods formed; useful us cooking, pepper left. You see, William, must birds island; least probable, seeds plants trees must brought them. The banana pepper food many birds. What quantity bananas springing spot; little forest weeks." "What rough-looking sort shrub there, Ready?" "I cannot see well you, William, let us walk it. Oh, I know now; call prickly pear West Indies. I glad found that, useful us." "Is good eating, Ready?" "Not particularly; little spikes run fingers, difficult get rid of; bad way change. No, use us hedge garden, protect animals; makes capital fence, grows fast, without trouble. Now let us go patch trees, see are." "What plant, Ready?" "I do not know, William." "Then I think I better make collection do not know, take back father; he good botanist." William pulled branch plant off, carried him. On arrival next patch trees, Ready looked steadfastly time. "I ought know tree," said he. "I often seen hot countries. Yes, it is guava." "What! fruit make guava jelly of?" said William. "Yes, same." "Let us walk direction five six trees," said William; "and rocks; I want find white." "Be so, wish," replied Ready. "Why, Ready, noise that? Hark! chattering, must monkeys." "No, monkeys; I will tell are, although I cannot see them; parrots--I know noise well. You see, William, it is likely monkeys get here, birds can, birds thank bananas guavas, fruits may find here." As soon came trees, great rioting fluttering, away flew, screaming loud could, flock three hundred parrots, beautiful green blue feathers glistening beams sun. "I told so; well, we will capital pies them, William." "Pies! make good pies, Ready?" "Yes, excellent; often I good dinner one West Indies, South America. Stop, let us come little way; I see leaf I like examine." "The ground swampy here, Ready; not?" "Yes; there is plenty water below, I do not doubt. So much better animals; must dig pools come here. "Oh! I thought I wrong. Look! best thing I found yet--we need care much potatoes." "Why, they, Ready?" "Yams, use instead potatoes West Indies. Indeed, potatoes remain potatoes long, planted hot climates." "How mean, Ready?" "They turn call sweet-potatoes, one two crops: yams better things, opinion." At moment dogs dashed among broad yam leaves, commenced baying; great rustling snorting. "What is that?" cried William, stooping examine yam plant, startled noise. Ready laughed heartily. "It is not first time they have made jump, William." "Why, it is pigs, is not it?" replied William. "To sure; they are yam patch, busy feeding them, I will bound." Ready gave shout, grunting rushing heard among broad leaves, and, soon, rushed, instead six, thirty pigs large small; who, snorting twisting tails, galloped away great rate, gained cocoa-nut grove. "How wild are, Ready!" said William. "Yes, they will wilder every day; must fence yams them, shall get none ourselves." "But they will beat fence grows up." "We must pale cocoa-nut palings, plant prickly pears outside. Now, we will go sea-side." As neared rocks, bare fifty yards water's edge, Ready said, "I tell white patches rocks are, William; places sea-birds come every year make nests, bring young. They always come place every year, disturbed." They soon arrived spot, found white feathers birds, mixed dirt. "I see nests, Ready, remains any." "No, make nests, scratching round hole, half inch deep, soil, lay eggs, sitting quite close one another; soon here, begin lay, come take eggs, want any, bad eating." "Why, Ready, quantity good things found already! This fortunate expedition ours." "Yes, has; may thank God his goodness, thus provides us plentifully wilderness." "Do know, Ready, I cannot help thinking ought built house here." "Not so, William; pure water, recollect, advantages sandy beach, turtle- fish-pond. No; may feed stock here; may gather fruit, taking share poor birds; may get yams, every good provided us; house home must now." "You right, Ready; long walk." "Not accustomed it, made beaten path; besides, may bring boat round, perhaps." Then walked along sea-side quarter mile, came rocks high, discovered little basin, completely formed rocks, narrow entrance. "See, William, nice little harbour boat! may load yams take round bay, provided find entrance reefs southern side it, looked yet, required it." "Yes, Ready--it is, indeed, nice, smooth little place boat. What thing bottom, there?" said William, pointing direction. "That sea crawfish, quite good eating lobster. I wonder I could make lobster-pot; catch plenty, good are." "And little rough things rock?" "They nice little sort oyster; like England, much better--they delicate." "Why, Ready, two good things table, again," replied William; "how rich shall be!" "Yes; catch them, recollect: nothing world without labour." "Ready," said William, "we good three hours' daylight; suppose go back tell seen: mother glad see us." "I agree you, William. We done well one day; may safely go back again, remain another week. There fruits present, I care yams; I like protect pigs. But let us go home talk matter Mr Seagrave." They found spot left knapsacks hatchets, took path cocoa-nut trees, following blaze made morning. One hour sunset arrived house, found Mr Mrs Seagrave sitting outside, Juno standing beach two children, amusing picking shells strewed about. William gave clear account seen, showed his father specimens plants he collected. "This," said Mr Seagrave, "is well-known plant; I wonder Ready recognise it; hemp." "I never saw except shape rope," replied Ready. "I know seed well enough." "Well, require it, I tell dress it," replied Mr Seagrave. "Now, William, next?" "This odd-looking, rough thing." "That is egg-plant: bears fruit blue colour. I told eat hot countries." "Yes, sir, do; fry pepper salt; call bringal. I think must that." "I doubt right," replied Mr Seagrave. "Why, William, know this." "It like grape-vine." "Yes, so; wild grape; shall eat bye." "I one more, papa: this?" "You do not know it, sprung high, William; common mustard plant,--what use England, sold mustard cress. I think made famous day's work it; much thank God for." As soon returned house, consultation held future proceedings; and, debate, agreed would advisable take boat sand; and, soon ready, examine reef southward, see could find passage it, would take long go round it; and, soon accomplished, Mr Seagrave, Ready, William, Juno go wood, carrying tent pitch newly-discovered piece ground: set flag-staff little harbour, point position. Of course, would hard day's work; would, nevertheless, return night, leave Mrs Seagrave alone children. Having accomplished this, Ready William would put wheels axle boat, articles required, saw, hatchets, spades, row round south side island, find little harbour. As soon landed them, secured boat, would return path wood. The next job would rail yam plantation keep pigs, and, time, drive sheep goats wood, might feed new pasture ground. Ready William cut cocoa-nut trees sufficient paling, fix posts, done, Mr Seagrave come assist railing in, drawing timber. This expected would done month; time, Mrs Seagrave Juno would be, greatest part it, left house, employ clearing garden weeds, making preparation fencing in. As soon important work completed, boat would return bay load prickly pears garden fence, direct attention stores saved wreck, lying cove first landed. When examined them, brought round required, secured storehouse, would regular survey island land water. But man proposes God disposes, shown interruption intended projects shall narrate ensuing chapter. CHAPTER FORTY THREE. As usual, Ready first following morning, greeted Juno, followed house, he set his accustomed rounds, examine stock possessions. He standing garden point. First he thought would necessary get ready sticks peas, seven eight inches ground; he proceeded little farther, calivances, French haricot beans, sown, decided upon propriety hoeing earth round them, valuable article food, would keep, afford many good dish rainy winter season. He gone ascertain cucumber seeds shown above-ground, pleased find well. He said himself, "We vinegar, I know of, preserve salt water, Russia; change, events;" he raised his eyes looked offing, and, usual, scanned horizon. He thought he saw ship north-east, he applied his telescope his eye. He mistaken--it vessel. The old man's heart beat quick; he dropped his telescope his arm, fetched heavy breaths he could recover effect unexpected sight. After minute, he put his telescope his eye, made her brig, top-sails top-gallant sails, steering directly island. Ready walked rocky point, fished, sat reflect. Could vessel sent them, she mere chance come among islands? He decided short time must chance, none could know saved, much less island. Her steering towards island must either she required water something else; perhaps she would alter her course pass them. "At events," thought old man, "we hands God, will, his time his way, us he thinks fit. I present say anything Mr Mrs Seagrave. It would cruel raise hopes might end disappointment. A hours decide. And yet I cannot without help--I must trust William." Ready rose, examined vessel his telescope, walked towards house. William up, remainder family stirring. "William," said Ready him, walked away house, "I secret tell you, see necessity telling anyone present. A hours decide question." William readily gave his promise. "There vessel island; she may means rescuing us, she may pass without seeing us. It would cruel disappointment father mother, latter case." William stared Ready, moment could speak, his excitement great. "Oh, Ready, grateful I am! I trust may taken away, idea poor father suffers silence--and mother." "I know it, William, I know it, natural; best control yearnings, more. But must quick, work breakfast. But stop, I show vessel." Ready caught vessel field telescope, he leant trunk cocoa-nut, William put his eye glass. "Do see her?" "Oh yes, Ready, she coming way." "Yes, she steering right island. I put telescope here, go work." William Ready went storehouse axe. Ready selected slight cocoa-nut tree nearest beach, he cut down, soon top taken assistance William he carried point. "Now, William, go shovel dig hole here, may fix flag-staff. When ready, I go small block rope halyards hoist flags soon vessel likely see them. At breakfast-time, I shall propose I get boat sand examine her, give Mr Seagrave work indoors." "But flags, Ready; round mother's bed. How shall get them?" "Suppose I say time house well cleaned, canvas hangings beds taken aired fine day. Ask father take direction work dig boat; employ inside house." "Yes, do, Ready." During breakfast-time, Ready observed he intended get boat sand, William assist him. "And I do, Ready?" said Mr Seagrave. "Why, sir, I think, rains over, would bad thing air bedding, say sea; fine, warm day; bedding taken house well shaken, left air, would good job over; see, sir, I thought house smell little close." "It good thing, Ready," observed Mrs Seagrave; "and, time, Juno I give house thorough cleaning sweeping." "Had better canvas screens down, air too?" "Yes," replied Ready; "we better air everything. We assist taking screens flags, spread air, then, Mr Seagrave objection, leave superintend assist Madam Juno." "With heart," replied Mr Seagrave. "We done breakfast, begin soon please." Ready William took canvas screens flags, went cottage them; spread canvas distance house, William went beach flags, Ready procured block small rope hoist with. Ready's stratagem answered well. Without perceived cottage, flag-staff raised, fixed ground, flags ready hoisting; Ready William returned fuel-stack, carried much stuff could hold, might make smoke attract notice board vessel. All occupy much hour, brig continued her course steadily towards island. When Ready first saw her wind light, latterly breeze increased much, last brig took her top-gallant sails. The horizon behind vessel, quite clear, banked clouds, waves curled white foam reefs rocks extending island. "The breeze getting strong, William," said Ready, "and she soon down, she frightened reefs, she see plainer water rough, she could before." "I trust she afraid," replied William. "How far think she now?" "About five miles; more. The wind hauled round southward, banking fast, I see. I fear shall another smart gale; however, will not last long. Come, let us hoist flags; must lose chance; flags blow nice clear see them." William Ready hoisted ensign first, flag, ship's name, Pacific, large letters upon it. "Now then," said Ready, he made fast halyards, "let us strike light make smoke; attract notice." As soon cocoa-nut leaves lighted, Ready William threw water upon them, damp procure heavy column smoke. The vessel approached rapidly, watching her silent suspense, perceived Mr Mrs Seagrave, Juno carrying Albert, Tommy Caroline running fast could beach. The fact was, Tommy, tired work, gone house walked towards beach; he perceived, first, flags hoisted, he detected vessel island. He immediately ran back house, crying out, "Papa! Mamma! Captain Osborn come back--come back big ship." At announcement, Mr Mrs Seagrave ran house, perceived vessel flags flying, ran fast could William Ready standing flag-staff. "Oh! Ready, tell us before?" exclaimed Mr Seagrave. "I wish known now, sir," replied Ready; "but, however, cannot helped; done kindness, Mr Seagrave." "Yes, indeed was, papa." Mrs Seagrave dropped rock, burst tears. Mr Seagrave equally excited. "Does she see us, Ready?" exclaimed he last. "No, sir, yet, I waited till she did, I made known you," replied Ready. "She altering her course, Ready," said William. "Yes, sir, she hauled wind; she afraid coming near reefs." "Surely she leaving us!" exclaimed Mrs Seagrave. "No, madam; she see us yet." "She does! she does!" cried William, throwing his hat; "see, she hoists her ensign." "Very true, sir; she see us. Thanks God!" Mr Seagrave embraced his wife, threw herself sobbing his arms, kissed his children rapture, wrung old Ready's hand. He almost frantic joy. William equally delighted. As soon little composed, Ready observed: "Mr Seagrave, seen us certain, must get boat sand. We know passage reefs, not. I doubt will, however, venture send boat shore, wind moderates little. You see, sir, blowing strong now." "But do not think blow harder, Ready?" "I sorry say, sir, I do. It looks threatening southward, gale over, venture near island surrounded rocks. It would imprudent did. However, sir, hours decide." "But, surely," said Mrs Seagrave, "even blow, leave island without taking us off. They come gale over." "Yes, madam, can, I think will; God knows, men hard hearts, feel little misery others." The brig had, meantime, kept away again, she running in; soon afterwards she hauled wind, her head northward, stood away island. "She leaving us," exclaimed William, mournfully. "Hard-hearted wretches!" said Mr Seagrave, indignation. "You wrong say that, sir," replied Ready: "excuse me, Mr Seagrave, bold; fact is, I command vessel, I done. The gale rises fast, would dangerous remain are. It prove intend leave us; consult safety, and, gale over, shall, I trust, see again." No reply made Ready's judicious remarks. The Seagraves saw vessel leaving them, hearts sank. They watched her silence, she gradually diminished view, hopes depart them. The wind fierce, heavy squall, rain, obscured offing, vessel longer distinguished. Mr Seagrave turned his wife, mournfully offered her his arm. They walked away beach without speaking; remainder party, exception old Ready, followed them. Ready remained time his eyes direction vessel last seen. At last he hauled ensign flag, and, throwing his shoulder, followed disconsolate party house. CHAPTER FORTY FOUR. When Ready arrived, he found plunged deep distress, he consider advisable say anything. The evening closed in; time retire. The countenance Mr Seagrave gloomy, morose. The hour retiring rest long passed Ready broke silence saying, "Surely, intend sit night, Mr Seagrave?" "Oh, no! there is use sitting now," replied Mr Seagrave, rising impatiently. "Come, dear, let us go bed." Mrs Seagrave rose, retired behind canvas screen. Her husband seemed he follow her, Ready, without speaking, laid Bible table him. Mr Seagrave appear notice it; William touched his father's arm, pointed book, went inside screen, led his mother. "God forgive me!" exclaimed Mr Seagrave. "In selfishness discontent I forgotten--" "Yes, sir, forgotten words, `Come unto me, ye weary heavy laden, I give rest.'" "I ashamed myself," said Mrs Seagrave, bursting tears. Mr Seagrave opened Bible, read psalm. As soon he closed book, "good night" words passed, retired rest. During night, wind howled rain beat down. The children slept soundly, Mr Mrs Seagrave, Ready, William awake whole night, listening storm, occupied thoughts. Ready dressed daylight, beach sun risen. The gale height; careful survey his telescope, he could see nothing vessel. He remained beach till breakfast-time, he summoned William, returned house. He found Mr Mrs Seagrave up, composed evening before; welcomed warmly. "I fear, Ready," said Mr Seagrave, "that good news us." "No, sir; expect good news gale over. The vessel could remain gale--that certain; saying effects gale may be. She may lie to, far us gale over; she may obliged scud gale, run hundred miles us. Then comes next chance. I think, her running island, she short water; question is, then, whether she may find necessary run port she bound to, water place. A captain vessel bound his best owners. At time I think, she propriety come back us she will. The question is, first, whether she can; and, secondly, whether captain humane man, his inconvenience." "There poor comfort that," replied Mr Seagrave. "It useless holding false hopes, sir," replied Ready; "but even vessel continues her voyage, much thankful for." "In what, Ready?" "Why, sir, one knew whether existence not, probably never searched for; made known, ship's name flag know are, and, arrive safe port, fail communicate intelligence friends. Is great deal thankful for? We may taken vessel, every hope another sent us." "Very true, Ready; I ought seen before; despair disappointment yesterday great, almost took away reason." The gale continued day, showed symptoms abatement, retired night. The following day Ready early, usual, William accompanied beach. "I do not think blows hard did, Ready." "No, William, not; gale breaking, night, I doubt, over. It is, however, useless looking vessel, she must long way this. It would take her week, perhaps, come back us she try so, unless wind change northward westward." "Ready! Ready!" exclaimed William, pointing south-east part reef; "what that? Look! it is boat." Ready put his telescope his eye. "It is canoe, William, people it." "Why, come from? See! among breakers; lost. Let us go towards them, Ready." They hastened along beach spot nearest canoe tossing surf, watched approached shore. "William, canoe must blown large island, lies there;" Ready looked his telescope: "there two people it, islanders. Poor things! struggle hard lives, seem much exhausted; passed dangerous part reef." "Yes," replied William, "they soon smoother water; surf beach heavy." "They will not mind that, strength do not fail them--they manage canoe beautifully." During conversation canoe rapidly come towards land. In moment two afterwards, passed surf grounded beach. The two people strength enough left paddle surf, dropped bottom canoe, quite exhausted. "Let us drag canoe higher up, William. Poor creatures! nearly dead." While dragging up, Ready observed occupants women: faces tattooed over; otherwise young, might good-looking. "Shall I run get something them, Ready?" "Do, William; ask Juno give whatever breakfast; anything warm." William soon returned thin oatmeal porridge, Juno preparing breakfast; spoonfuls forced throats two natives gradually revived. William left Ready, went acquaint his father mother unexpected event. William soon returned Mr Seagrave, women able sit up, hauled canoe far could, prevent her beat pieces. They found nothing canoe, except piece matting two paddles used natives. "You see, sir," said Ready, "it clear two poor women, left charge canoe, blown shore one islands south-east; must contending gale ever since day yesterday, and, appears, without food water. It is mercy gained island." "It so," replied Mr Seagrave; "but tell truth, I pleased arrival. It proves sure before, near neighbours, may probably pay us unwelcome visit." "That may be, sir," replied Ready; "still two poor creatures thrown shore make matter worse, danger greater. Perhaps may turn advantage; women learn speak English islanders visit us, interpret us, means, perhaps, saving lives." "Would visit dangerous, then, Ready?" "Why, sir, savage savage, and, like child, wishes obtain whatever he sees; especially he covets he may turn use, iron, etcetera. If came, concealed portion, gave remainder goods, might escape; still trusting them, I would infinitely prefer defending numbers trusting mercy." "But defend multitude?" "We must prepared, sir: fortify ourselves, muskets would match hundreds." Mr Seagrave turned away. After pause he said, "It pleasant talking defending savages, hoped two days ago leaving island. Oh, brig would make appearance again!" "The wind going fast, sir," observed Ready; "it fine weather evening. We may look her; events, next week I shall give hopes." "A whole week, Ready! Alas! true is, hope deferred maketh heart sick." "It severe trial, Mr Seagrave; must submit chastened. We better get poor creatures house, let recover themselves." Ready beckoned get feet, did, although difficulty. He went advance, making sign follow; understood him, made attempt, weak, would fallen supported Mr Seagrave William. It required long time arrive house. Mrs Seagrave, knew happened, received kindly, Juno mess ready, she put them. They ate little lay down, soon sound asleep. "It fortunate us women," observed Mr Seagrave: "we great difficulty men." "Yes, sir," replied Ready; "but still must trust women much first, savages." "Where shall put to-night, Ready?" "Why, sir, I thinking that. I wish she would close us; not, must let sleep storehouse." We must pass space fifteen days, nothing done. The expectation vessel returning still alive, although day decreased hopes. Every morning Ready William beach telescope, whole day passed surmises, hopes, fears. In fact, appearance vessel expectation leaving island completely overturned regularity content island party. No subject broached--not work proposed begun, useless anything leave island. After first week passed, felt every day chances adverse, end fortnight hopes unwillingly abandoned. The Indian women had, meantime, recovered fatigues, appeared mild tractable. Whatever able do, cheerfully, already gained words English. The party explore talked over, arranged following Monday, new misfortune fell them, disconcerted arrangements. On Saturday morning, Ready, usual, went his rounds, he walked along beach, he perceived Indian canoe missing. It hauled clear water, could floated away. Ready's heart misgave him; he looked his telescope direction large island, thought he could distinguish speck water great distance. As he thus occupied, William came him. "William," said Ready, "I fear island women escaped canoe. Run up, see outhouse, anywhere else, let know soon can." William minutes returned, breathless, stating women found, evidently carried away quantity large nails pieces iron small kegs storehouse. "This bad, William; worse vessel coming back." "Why, without them, Ready." "Yes; get back people, show iron brought them, describe much had, depend upon it, shall visit numbers, may obtain more. I ought known better leave canoe here. We must go consult Mr Seagrave, sooner begin work now, better." They communicated intelligence Mr Seagrave outside. He perceived danger, held council, came following resolutions:-- That would necessary immediately stockade storehouse, render impossible one get in; that, soon fortification complete, storehouse turned dwelling-house; stores could put within stockade removed present house, concealed cocoa-nut grove. It decided nothing begun day, Saturday; Sunday spent devout prayer help encouragement Almighty, would towards his wisdom ordain; Monday, blessing God, would recommence labour. "I do not know why, I feel courage prospect danger, I felt little none," said Mrs Seagrave. "How little know day may bring forth!" exclaimed Mr Seagrave. "How joyful anticipations vessel hoisted her colours! felt sure taken island. The gale drove vessel away brought us island women. The fair weather gale, hoped would brought back vessel succour, contrary enabled women escape canoe, make known existence may come destroy us. How true man plans vain; Almighty pleasure he obtain his ends!" CHAPTER FORTY FIVE. But although resolved stated last chapter, nothing done. Finally, one morning sunrise, looking round telescope, close turtle-pond, Masterman Ready said Mr Seagrave, "Indeed, sir, must longer remain state idleness; I thinking great deal present position prospects; vessel coming back, must, present, give hopes it. I wish quite sure shall visit savages: great fear, really haunts me; idea surprised night, Mrs Seagrave dear children, perhaps, murdered beds, awful reflect upon." "God help us!" exclaimed Mr Seagrave, covering his face. "God help us, Mr Seagrave, time necessary help ourselves; he give his blessing exertions, cannot expect miracles performed us; remain are, inactive, taking steps meet danger threatens us, cannot expect divine assistance. We heavy shock, time recover it, put shoulders wheel." "I agree you, Ready," replied William; "indeed I thinking thing many days past." "We thinking it, I believe," said Mr Seagrave; "I am sure I lain awake night night, considering position ought do, I never able come satisfactory resolution." "No I till last night, Mr Seagrave, I think I something propose which, perhaps, meet approval," replied Ready; "so now, sir, suppose hold another council, come decision." "I willing, Ready," said Mr Seagrave, sitting upon rock; "and oldest, moreover best adviser three, first hear propose." "Well then, Mr Seagrave, appears remain house, may, I said, surprised savages hour night, means defence numbers." "I feel that, felt time," replied Mr Seagrave. "What shall do, then; shall return cove?" "I think not, sir," said Ready; "what I propose this: made discovery south island, great importance us; I consider fruit plants great value, serve increase luxuries, I may call them, summer season. One great advantage us, feed found live stock, fodder rainy season; principally, patch yams, afford us food winter. They great importance us, cannot soon protect pigs, certainly root up, prevent them. Now, sir, know arranged do, done; I think cocoa-nut rails take much time, sufficient make ditch hedge round yams; tedious go backwards forwards work, Mrs Seagrave children left alone. I therefore propose, weather set fair, remain months, pitch tents part island, remove whole family there; shall soon comfortable, events much safer remain here, without defence." "It excellent plan, Ready; shall, say, removed danger time, there, may consider best by." "Yes, sir. Those women may gained island, true, wind right several days went away canoe, and, moreover, current sets strong way; have, must expect savages pay us visit; will, course, come direct house, come." "But, Ready, do not mean say leave side island altogether, comfortable arrangements?" said William. "No, William, altogether; I come second part proposition. As soon done work yam plantation, made everything comfortable can, I think may leave Mrs Seagrave children tents, work here. As agreed, let us abandon house live present, fit outhouse concealed cocoa-nut grove, dwelling-house, fortify secure sudden attack savages: for, return must, live, cannot remain tents rainy season sets in." "How propose fortify it, Ready?" said Mr Seagrave; "I hardly know." "That I explain by, sir. Then, savages come here, events able defend fire-arms; one man behind stockade better twenty arms spears clubs; may, help God, beat off." "I think plan excellent, Ready," said Mr Seagrave, "and sooner begin, better." "That doubt of, sir. Now, first job William try passage side reef boat, look little harbour discovered; soon done, return take tents require round boat, pitched tents arranged, Mrs Seagrave children walk wood us, take possession." "Let us lose hour, Ready; lost much time already," replied Mr Seagrave. "What shall to-day?" "After breakfast, William I take boat, try passage. You remain here, packing tents articles must first carried round. We shall back, I hope, dinner-time." They rose, walked towards house; felt relieved minds, made arrangement, satisfied would using human endeavours ward danger threatened them, might put confidence Providence would, he thought fit, protect need. CHAPTER FORTY SIX. The subject introduced Mrs Seagrave, breakfast, she perceived much secure would be, she cheerfully consented. In less hour afterwards, William Ready prepared boat, pulling among rocks reef find passage, which, short time, keeping two three cables point, succeeded doing. "This fortunate, William," observed Ready; "but must take marks find way again. See, large black rock line garden point: so, keep one, shall know proper channel; mark abreast us, find enter it." "Why, Ready, corner turtle-pond touches right wall house," replied William. "So does; do; let us pull away hard can, back good time." They soon south side island, pulling along shore. "How far think water, Ready?" "I hardly know; least four five miles, must make minds good hour's pull. At events, shall sail back wind, although little it." "We deep water now," observed William, long silence. "Yes, side island must expect it; coral grows leeward only. I think cannot far little harbour discovered. Suppose leave rowing minute, look us." "There two rocks close shore, Ready," said William, pointing, "and recollect two three rocks outside harbour." "Very true, William, I wonder hit upon spot. Let us pull in." They so; and, satisfaction, found harbour, water smooth pond. "Now, then, William, step mast, sail back leisure." "Stop one moment, Ready; give boat-hook. I see something clefts rocks." Ready handed boat-hook William, who, lowering water, drove spike iron end large crayfish, he hauled boat. "That addition dinner," said Ready; "we go back empty-handed, and, therefore, saying is, shall welcome; now, then, let us start, must pull afternoon, full cargo board." They stepped mast, soon pulled boat clear harbour, set sail, less hour rejoined party house. William brought crayfish, one claw, Juno put another pot water boil it, addition dinner, nearly ready. Tommy first went his sister Caroline look animal, soon he left admiring it, he began, usual, tease it; first he poked eyes stick, he tried unfold his tail, animal flapped, he ran away. At last he trying put his stick creature's mouth, raised large claw, caught wrist, squeezing tight Tommy screamed danced crayfish held on. Fortunately him, animal long water, much hurt iron spike boat-hook, half-dead, he would severely hurt. Ready ran him, disengaged crayfish; Tommy frightened, he took his heels, leave running he one hundred yards house, Juno Ready laughing till tears came eyes. When he saw crayfish table, he appeared afraid it, although dead. "Well, Tommy," said Mr Seagrave, "I suppose will not eat crayfish?" "Will not I?" replied Tommy. "I will eat him, he tried eat me." "Why leave animal alone, Tommy?" said Mr Seagrave; "if tormented it, would bitten you; I do not know whether ought any." "I do not like it; I will not any," replied Tommy. "I like salt pork better." "Well, then, do not like it, shall forced upon you, Tommy," replied Mr Seagrave; "so we will divide among rest us." Tommy well pleased decision, he really wish it, he turned sulky rest dinner-time, especially old Ready told he his share crayfish dinner. CHAPTER FORTY SEVEN. As soon meal over, Mr Seagrave Juno assisted carrying canvas poles tent, shovels clear away, pegs fix tents properly. Before started, William observed, "I think would good thing, Ready I take bedding us, could fix one tent evening, sleep there; to-morrow morning might set other, get good deal work come back." "You right, William," replied Ready; "let us see Juno give us eat, say, sooner better." As Mr Seagrave opinion, Juno packed piece salt pork flour-cakes, which, three four bottles water, took boat. Ready thrown piece rope moor boat with, shoved soon reef, and, smart pull, arrived small harbour. As soon landed things, made boat fast rope, carried portion canvas tent-poles first copse trees, guavas; returned remainder, three trips everything up. "Now, William, must see pitch tent; must near cocoa-nut grove, shall far go water." "Do not think best place close bananas? ground higher there, water is, know, bananas yams." "Very true, I think bad place; let us walk first, reconnoitre ground." They walked bananas throwing beautiful large green leaves, decided would fix tents upon north side them. "So let be," said Ready; "and let us go fetch things; nice dry spot, I think capitally." They soon hard work, long sunset one tent ready, put bedding it. "Well, now, I suppose little tired," said Ready; "I am sure ought be, worked hard to-day." "I do not feel tired, Ready, it is time go bed yet." "No; I think better take shovels dig pits water, shall know to-morrow morning whether water good not." "Yes, Ready, get supper." They walked ground bananas yam patch wet swampy, dug two large holes yard deep square; water trickled fast, ankles finished. "There will want water, Ready, fit drink." "I have fear that," replied Ready. They returned tent made supper salt pork flour-cakes, lay mattresses. They soon fast asleep, tired hard work gone through. The next morning, sunrise, again; first thing go examine holes dug water; found full running over, water settled quite clear; tasted it, pronounced good. As soon washed themselves, went back made breakfast, set work get tent. They cleared ground near tents brushwood high grass, levelled nicely shovels inside. "Now, William, another job, prepare fireplace Juno: must go beach stones." In another hour fireplace completed, Ready William looked work. "Well, I call comfortable lodging-house," said Ready. "And I sure," replied William, "it is pretty. Mamma delighted it." "We shall want bananas weeks," said Ready; "look, blossom already. Well, I suppose better leave everything here, go back. We must another trip afternoon, sleep to-night." They went boat, sailed back before; ten of the clock morning regained house, made arrangements work remainder day. It agreed provisions necessary day two, table chairs, cooking utensils, portion clothes, taken round afternoon, Ready William come back early next morning, set together wood new location. The sheep lambs (for four lambs), goats kids, driven wood Mr Seagrave; William Ready dogs would useful driving them. As fowls chickens, decided left, Ready William could look occasional visits. CHAPTER FORTY EIGHT. The boat well loaded afternoon, heavy pull round, hard work afterwards carry articles up. William Ready were, therefore, sorry work done, went bed soon taken supper. At sunrise, went back bay boat, hauled up, proceeded house, found everyone ready start. Mr Seagrave collected animals, set off; marks trees plain, difficulty finding way; good deal trouble goats sheep, get fast. It three hours got clear cocoa-nut grove, Mrs Seagrave quite tired out. At last arrived, Mr Mrs Seagrave could help exclaiming "How beautiful!" When came tents pitched side bananas, equally pleased: quite fairy spot. Mrs Seagrave went her tent repose her fatigue; goats sheep allowed stray away pleased; dogs lay down, panting long journey; Juno put Albert bed she went William collect fuel cook dinner; Ready went pits get water, Mr Seagrave walked about, examining different clumps trees meadow studded. When Ready returned water, he called dogs, went back towards yam plantation. Tommy followed them; dogs went yams, soon barking furiously, pleased Tommy much; when, sudden, burst drove pigs, followed dogs, close Tommy he screamed fright, tumbled head heels. "I thought there, gentlemen," said Ready, looking pigs; "the sooner fence better." The pigs scampered away, went cocoa-nut grove done before. The dogs followed pigs, return long afterwards. It late dinner ready, glad go early bed. At day dawn, William Ready started, walked cocoa-nut grove back house, bring round boat articles furniture clothes left. Having collected everything house, procured pork flour storehouse, completed load spearing one turtles remained, putting bottom boat; set new residence, arrived time breakfast. "What delightful spot is!" said Mrs Seagrave. "I think ought always make summer residence, go back house rainy season." "It much cooler here, madam, summer, much pleasant; protected house cocoa-nut grove." "Yes; true, valuable rainy season; makes warmer summer time. I like change, Ready, shall sorry go back again." "Now I must go, help Juno cut turtle," said Ready. "We must make larder among banana trees." "But do, Ready?" said Mr Seagrave. "We must idle." "No, sir; I think must give day putting everything rights, making everything comfortable inside tents; to-morrow commence ditch hedge round yam plantation. We need work hard it, I do not think pigs venture again, I mean tie dogs round yam patch every night, barking keep off." "That good plan, Ready. What beautiful food sheep goats!" "Yes; must future residence best part year. I think to-morrow begin piece ditch, show William put cuttings prickly pear hedge, then, I propose I go cove examine stores select necessary bring round. I think said must go yourself?" "Yes, Ready, I wish go. When made selection, I return, William, used boat I am, bring stores round. I presume shall bring here?" "No, sir, take round storehouse. When done job, must commence alterations stockade." CHAPTER FORTY NINE. The next morning went shovels yam plantation, commenced work. As ground soft swampy, labour easy. The ditch dug nearly yard wide, earth thrown bank inside. They went large patch prickly pears grew, cut quantity, planted top bank. Before night, finished nine ten yards hedge ditch. "I do not think pigs get finished," said Ready, "and William able get gone, well him." "I will try I cannot shoot pig two," said William. "Let young one, then; must kill old ones. Now I think may well go back. Juno carrying supper." Before Mr Seagrave Ready started following morning, latter gave William directions boat. The provisions knapsack already prepared, took leave Mrs Seagrave, set off, armed musket, Ready his axe slung his shoulder. They long walk them, first find way back house, thence walk wood cove. In two hours leaving house reached spot first landed. The rocks near strewed timber planks, lay bleaching sun, half-buried sand. Mr Seagrave sat down, sighed deeply he said, "Ready, sight timbers, good ship Pacific built, recalls feelings I hoped dismissed mind; I cannot help rising up. The remains vessel appear last link us civilised world, torn from, thoughts home country, I may say longing them, revived strong ever." "And natural should, Mr Seagrave; I feel also. I content, true, I nothing wish look forward to; still I could help thinking poor Captain Osborn shipmates, I looked upon wreck, wishing I might take hand again. It natural one so. Why, sir, know I feel unhappy even poor ship. We sailors love vessels, especially good qualities, Pacific fine vessel ever built. Now, sir, I feel quite melancholy I see her planks timbers lying here. But, sir, cannot help feeling do, duty check feeling, get mastery us. We more." "Very true, Ready," said Mr Seagrave, rising up; "it useless, even sinful indulge them, lead repining decrees heaven. Let us examine rocks, see anything thrown may use us." They walked round, but, exception spars barrel two tar, could find nothing value. There want staves iron hoops broken casks, these, Ready observed, would make excellent palings garden time bring round. After returned, sat rest themselves, went tents cocoa-nut grove, collected articles thrown ship went pieces. "Why, pigs work here!" said Ready; "they contrived open one cask flour somehow another; look, sir--I suppose must shaky, could routed it; canvas good much, I fear; fortunately, several bolts new, I brought shore. Now, sir, see condition stores in. All casks flour, run risk opening them, seeing good order." The first cask opened cake round hard board; cut axe, inside found good state. "That is right, sir; I presume others same; salt water got far made crust, preserved rest. But let us go dinner, work afterwards." CHAPTER FIFTY. After dinner resumed labour. "I wonder what is case?" said Mr Seagrave, pointing first hand. Ready set work his axe, broke lid, found number pasteboard boxes full tapes, narrow ribbons, stay-laces, whalebones, cottons reels. "This sent Botany Bay milliner," said Mr Seagrave. "I presume, however, must confiscate benefit Mrs Seagrave Miss Caroline. We take soon time." The next box without lock; lid forced up, found dozen half-gallon square bottles gin stored divisions. "That is Hollands, sir, I know," said Ready; "what shall it?" "We destroy it, Ready, time use medicine," replied Mr Seagrave; "we long used spring-water, would pity renew taste spirituous liquors." "I trust shall never want drink drop it, sir, either medicine otherwise. Now cask wooden hoops." The head soon out, discovered dinner set painted china gold edges. "This, Mr Seagrave, may useful, rather short plates dishes. Common white would served well." "And suitable present outfit," replied Mr Seagrave. "Here is box name it, sir," said Ready; "do know it?" "I idea, Ready; axe decide point." When box opened, everything appeared sad mouldy state salt water penetrated; removing brown paper pasteboard, found contain stationery sorts, and, except outside, little injured. "This indeed treasure, Ready. I recollect now; paper, pens, everything requisite writing, besides children's books, copy-books, paint-boxes, great many articles stationery line." "Well, sir, fortunate. Now may set school, whole population island attend it, really National School." "Very true, Ready. Now cask." "I tell outside; oil, acceptable, candles nearly out. Now come valuable property." "What that, Ready?" "All articles I brought shore different trips I took boat ship went pieces; see, sir, iron do not swim, and, therefore, I looked ironware sorts, tools. Here three kegs small nails, besides two bags large, several axes, hammers, tools, besides hanks twine, sailing needles, bees'-wax." "They indeed valuable, Ready." "Here is plunder, Americans say. All wash-deck buckets, small harness cask salting meat, here is cook's wooden trough making bread, please Miss Juno; it, see, I put galley-hooks, ladles, spoons, iron trivets, here is two lamps. I think I put cotton wicks somewhere--I know I did; shall find by. Here is two casks, one cartridges made up, gunpowder, six muskets." "These really treasures, Ready, yet well done without them." "Very true, sir, shall better them, fit storehouse dwelling, Mr Seagrave, shall able make little comfortable every respect present one; see there, fir-planking deals, William I buried sand." "I really quite forgotten them, Ready. If I could get fear savages coming head, I really think might live comfortably even island." "Do know, Mr Seagrave, I glad hear say that, proves contented resigned were." "I so, Ready--at least I think so; perhaps is, immediate danger savages fills thoughts, I longer dwell much upon taken island." "I dare say state, sir; let us go search. Here ship's compasses, deep sea line reel, also land lead. The stuff useful little boat." "And I glad compasses, Ready; I shall able make sort survey island, I little time. Your pocket compass small surveying. I shall take bearings now, I here, I may back soon." "Well, sir, I think open case, I perceive name it, much need to-day, sun going down; make kind bed, eat suppers, go sleep." "I tired, Ready, shall glad propose. That case contains books; portion library I know." "But soon will, sir," replied Ready, wrenching open his axe. "They little stained outside, jammed tight appear suffered much. Here one two, sir." "Plutarch's Lives. I glad I them: excellent reading young old; occasion open more, I know books case `History'; perhaps best case could saved." CHAPTER FIFTY ONE. Mr Seagrave Ready set work, made rough sort bed cocoa-nut branches; and, eating supper, committed divine protection, went sleep. The next morning resumed labour, opened every case package saved wreck; found books, four boxes candles, three casks rice, several useful articles, besides many others value them. A chest tea, two bags coffee, Ready brought shore, were, much delight, found good order; sugar, little saved melted away. "That is unfortunate, sir." "We cannot expect get things here, though hundred yards grocer's shop. Now let us go covered articles sand." The sand shovelled up, barrels beef pork deal boards found good order, many things quite spoilt. About noon finished, plenty time, Mr Seagrave took bearings different points land compasses. They shouldered muskets, set return. They gained house bay, rested little storehouse, proceeded way tents meadow. They half mile go, Ready heard noise, made sign Mr Seagrave stop. Ready, whispering Mr Seagrave pigs close them, loaded his musket; Mr Seagrave same, walked softly heard grunting; see till within twenty yards, came upon whole herd; pigs raised heads; old ones gave loud grunt, then, Ready fired his musket, set full speed. Mr Seagrave opportunity firing, Ready shot one, lay kicking struggling cocoa-nut tree. "A piece fresh pork quite treat, Mr Seagrave," said Ready, walked animal lying. "It will, indeed, Ready," replied Mr Seagrave; "we must contrive carry beast home us." "We sling musket, sir, heavy. It one born island, fine fellow his age." The pig soon slung, carried them. As cleared wood, perceived Mrs Seagrave William, heard report musket, come meet them. William took load his father, walked Mrs Seagrave. "Well, William, news you?" said Ready. "Why, good, Ready. Yesterday evening, I tired work, I thought I would take boat, try fish caught side island deep water, I caught three large ones, quite different took among reefs. We one breakfast dinner to-day, excellent." "Did go boat yourself?" "No; I took Juno me. She pulls well, Ready." "She handy girl, William. Well, survey, plenty work me, I tell you; I do not think bring everything round week; I suppose to-morrow better off." "Well, I like boating better ditching, I tell you, Ready," replied William. "I shall not sorry leave work father." "I suppose must fall him; he will, course, prefer staying Mrs Seagrave children." As soon tents, Ready hung pig cross pole tent he William Mr Seagrave slept, propped muskets side tent, he went William get his knife stretchers wood open pig with. While he William away, Caroline Tommy came look it, Tommy, telling Caroline glad he roast pig dinner, took one muskets, said, "Now, Caroline, I will shoot pig." "Oh! Tommy, must touch gun," cried Caroline; "papa angry." "I do not care," replied Tommy. "I will show shoot pig." "Do not, Tommy," cried Caroline; "if do, I will go tell mamma." "Then I will shoot you," replied Tommy, trying point musket her. Caroline frightened, she ran away fast she could, Tommy, using his strength, contrived get musket his shoulder, pulled trigger. It happened Tommy taken Mr Seagrave's musket, fired, he pulled trigger went off, he hold tight his shoulder, recoiled, hit butt right his face, knocking two his teeth, besides making his nose bleed fast. Tommy astonished frightened musket going off, blow he received, he gave loud yell, dropped musket, ran tent his father mother were, started rushed hearing report. When Mrs Seagrave saw Tommy covered blood, screaming loud, she alarmed she could stand, fell fainting Mr Seagrave's arms. Ready William, hearing musket go off, run fast could, fearing accident happened; Mr Seagrave supported his wife, Ready went Tommy, wiping blood his face palm his hand, perceived wound serious mischief, cried Mr Seagrave, "He is hurt, sir; it is his nose bleeding." "Musket knocked down," cried Tommy, sobbing blood ran his mouth. "Serve right, Tommy; you will take care touch musket again." "I will not touch again," cried Tommy, blubbering. Juno came water wash his face; Mrs Seagrave recovered, gone back tent, Mr Seagrave telling her Tommy's nose bleeding. In half-an-hour Tommy ceased crying, his nose left bleeding; his face washed, discovered he lost two front teeth, his cheek lips much bruised. He undressed, put bed, soon fast asleep. "I left muskets," said Ready William; "it fault; I thought Tommy told often touch fire-arms, he would dare so." "He pointed me, tried shoot me," said Caroline, "but I ran away." "Merciful heavens! escape!" cried Mrs Seagrave. "He well punished time, madam, I will venture say he touch musket hurry." "Yes; he must punished more," said Mr Seagrave. "He must remember it." "Well, sir, he punished more, I think cannot punish better allowing pig cooked." "I think too, Ready; therefore settled thing--no pig Tommy." CHAPTER FIFTY TWO. The next morning Tommy's face presented woeful appearance. His cheek lips swelled black, loss his two front teeth made look much worse. Tommy looked glum he came breakfast. There pig's fry breakfast, smell inviting Tommy; his father scolded him, told he one bit pig, he began cry roar loud, he sent away tents till he left off. After breakfast, Ready proposed he William take boat, begin labour carrying articles round cove bay house was, pointing day lost. Juno had, his request, already baked large piece pig take them, boiled piece salt pork, ready start. "But, Ready," said Mrs Seagrave, "how long intend remain absent William?" "Why, madam, Wednesday; course shall back Saturday night." "My dear William, I cannot bear idea absent long, water every day, I shall continual fright I see again." "Well, mamma, I suppose I must write penny post, let know I am." "Do not laugh me, William. I wish penny post, could write every day." Ready William made every preparation continued absence. They took blankets them, small pot cooking, prepared bade Mr Mrs Seagrave farewell. They pull bay, leave luggage, go round cove. As shoved off, William took dog Remus boat. "Why take dog, William? he use keeping pigs away, use us." "Yes, he will, Ready; I must take him; I idea come head, let way." "Well, William, always way, far I am concerned; wish take dog, end matter." They hoisted sail, breeze fresh, round bay short time. They took provisions stores house, made fast door, called fowls, gave damaged rice Ready brought cove, found, great delight, upwards forty chickens; some, indeed, quite grown, large enough kill. They got boat again, pulled away cove; wind fresh, them, long pull; but, Ready observed, much better so, as, boat loaded, could quickly sail back bay. As soon arrived cove, lost time loading boat; nails, iron work every description, twine tools, composed major part first cargo; calling Remus, lying sandy beach, shoved off, hoisted sail, hour regained bay, passed reef. "I glad cargo arrived safe, William, valuable us. Now take up, sufficient to-day; to-morrow, can, make two trips." "We can, start early," replied William; "but let us dinner, carry remainder things afterwards." As eating dinner, William giving bones dog, Ready said, "Pray, William, idea head made bring Remus you?" "I tell you, Ready; I mean carry letter mamma; know he always goes back he ordered, I wish see he go back tents, he told. I brought piece paper pencil me." William wrote paper: "Dear Mamma:--We quite well, returned first cargo quite safe. Your affectionate son, WILLIAM." William tied paper round dog's neck piece twine, calling house, said him, "Remus, go back, sir--go back, sir;" dog looked wistfully William, sure he do, William took stone, pretended throw dog, ran away little distance, stopped. "_Go back_, Remus--_go back_, sir." William pretended throw stone, repeating order, dog set fast his legs could carry cocoa-nut grove. "He gone events," said William; "I think he go home." "We shall see, sir," replied Ready; "and finished dinner, bring things, put storehouse." CHAPTER FIFTY THREE. As soon carried whole cargo, secured boat, went house sleep. Just went in, Remus came bounding letter round his neck. "Here is dog, William," said Ready; "he will not go home all." "How provoking! I made sure he would go back; I really disappointed. We give nothing eat, he will; but, dear me, Ready! paper I tied round his neck. I think not. Let see." William took paper, opened it, read-- "Dear William:--Your letter arrived safe, glad well. Write every day, God bless you; clever Remus. Your affectionate mother, SELINA SEAGRAVE." "Well, clever," said Ready; "I am sure I idea he gone; his coming back again, too, he ordered." "Dear Remus, good dog," said William, caressing it: "now I will give good supper, deserve it." "So he does, sir. Well, you have established post island, great improvement. Seriously, William, may prove useful." "At events great comfort mother." "Yes, especially shall obliged three fit storehouse, make proposed alterations. Now I think better go bed, must lark to-morrow." "Here I suppose ought say, parrots; land birds island." "You forget pigeons; I saw one wood day. Good night!" The next morning, breakfast. The boat soon loaded, returned sail. They breakfasted, left things brought beach, might lose time, set again, returned another cargo two hours dusk; landed, secured boat. As soon house, William wrote piece paper:-- "Dear Mamma:--We brought round two cargoes to-day. All well, tired. Yours, WILLIAM." Remus require teaching time. William patted him, said, "Good dog. Now, Remus, go back--go home, sir;" dog wagged his tail, set immediately. Before bed, dog returned answer. "How fast he must run, Ready! he away two hours." "No. So, now, Remus, shall plenty supper, plenty patting coaxing, clever, good little dog." The next day, take two cargoes house, could make one trip cove. On Saturday made one trip, return tents, water, first put turtle boat; arrival, found little harbour, waiting receive them. "Well, William, keep promise send letter post," said Mrs Seagrave. "How delightful is! I shall fear away." "I must teach Romulus Vixen same, mamma." "And I will teach puppies," said Tommy. "Yes, Tommy; time write letter, puppies old enough carry it," said Ready. "Come, Albert, I will carry up; I have not game play long while. How ditch hedge get on, Mr Seagrave?" "Pretty well, Ready," replied Mr Seagrave; "I nearly finished two sides. I think end next week I shall pretty well inclosed it." "Well, sir, must work hard, great hurry; William I get great deal together." "It duty work, Ready; I may add, pleasure." As supper conversation turned upon cleverness shown dog Remus. Mr Seagrave narrated many instances sagacity animals, William asked question his father: "What difference reason instinct?" "The difference great, William, I explain you; I must first observe, custom say man governed reason, animals instinct, alone. This error. Man instinct well reason; animals, although chiefly governed instinct, reasoning powers." "In points man show he led instinct?" "When child first born, William, acts instinct only: reasoning powers yet developed; grow up, reason becomes every day matured, gains mastery instinct, decreases proportion." "Then grown good old age, I suppose instinct left us?" "Not so, dear boy; one powerful instinct implanted man never deserts side grave. It fear, death, utter annihilation, becoming nothing death. This instinctive feeling could deeply implanted us, assurance shall annihilated death, souls shall still exist, although bodies shall perished. It may termed instinctive evidence future existence." "That true, Mr Seagrave," observed Ready. "Instinct animals, William," continued Mr Seagrave, "is feeling compels perform certain acts without previous thought reflection; instinct full force moment birth; therefore perfect beginning, never varied. The swallow built her nest, spider web, bee formed comb, precisely way four thousand years ago, now. I may observe, one greatest wonders instinct mathematical form honeycomb bee, proved demonstration given greatest possible saving time labour." "But pure instinct, papa; said animals reasoning powers. Will point show have?" "I will, dear boy; better defer till another evening. It time go bed." CHAPTER FIFTY FOUR. The following day, Sunday, devoted usual religious exercises. Tommy stole away tent, Mr Seagrave reading sermon, peep turtle-soup, boiling fire; however, Juno suspected him, hold he taking lid pot. He well scolded, much frightened lest he soup his dinner; however, heavy offence, he forgiven. In evening, William requested his father renew conversation reasoning powers animals. "With pleasure, William," replied Mr Seagrave; "it fit discourse Sunday evening. Let us, however, first examine various mental faculties discoverable animals. In first place, memory, especially memory persons places, quite tenacious own. A dog recognise old master many years absence. An elephant, escaped woods, twenty years remaining wild state, recognised his old mahoot, driver. A dog find his way back taken hundred miles his master's residence. Another proof memory animals, required, dream. Now, dream confused recollection past events; often hear Romulus Remus growling, barking, whining sleep!" "Very true, papa." "Well, then, attention. See patiently cat remain hours hole, watch mouse come out. A spider remain months watching fly enter web; quality observed every animal pursuit prey. They also association ideas, is, fact, reasoning. A dog proves that; he allow gentleman come door, fly beggar. When he charge property he take notice passer-by; man stops, he barks immediately. In elephant association ideas even remarkable; indeed, he understands said better animal; his reasoning powers extraordinary. Promise rewards, he make wonderful exertion. He also extremely alive sense shame. The elephants employed transport heavy artillery India. One finest attempted vain force gun swamp. `Take away lazy beast,' said director `and bring another.' The animal stung reproach, used much exertion force gun head, fracture skull, fell dead. When Chunee, elephant long Exeter Change, ordered usual take sixpence his trunk, happened one day sixpence rolled skirting-board, his reach. Chunee stopped, reflected little while, then, drawing air his trunk, he threw his force skirting-board; rebound air skirting-board blew sixpence towards him, he enabled reach it." "That clever him," replied William. "Yes; proof thought, knowledge effect. There curious instance horse, which, bye, I consider noble animal creation, ridden round his master, deliver newspapers. He invariably stopped doors papers left; happened two people, living different houses, took weekly newspaper them; agreed, one first reading one week, following. After short time horse became accustomed arrangement, stopped one house one week, house following, never making mistake." "That curious; sagacious animal he must been!" observed William. "Animals also are, know, capable receiving instruction, another proof reasoning powers. The elephant, horse, dog, pig, even birds may taught great deal." "But then, papa, I still wish know line drawn reason instinct." "I come point, William. When animals follow instinct providing food, bringing young, precautions danger, follow certain fixed rules, never deviate. But circumstances may occur instinct afford regular provision; reasoning powers called action. I explain stating fact relative bee, one animals upon instinct powerful action. There certain large moth, called Death's-head moth, fond honey. It sometimes contrives force way aperture hive, gain entrance. The bees immediately attack it, soon destroyed stings; carcass large, cannot carry hive, invariably bodies smaller insects may intruded, appears sense smell acute. What, then, avoid stench arising dead body large moth? Why, embalm it, covering entirely wax, longer becomes offensive them." "But, papa, might instinct provided event?" observed William. "If event could occurred bees wild state, certainly might raised question; recollect, William, bees wild state live hollows trees, hole enter never sufficiently large admit one bee time; consequently, animal larger bee could gain entrance, did, could course easily removed hive; bees new position, artificial state, hive straw large aperture, therefore met exigence prepared for, acted accordingly." "Yes, papa, I perceive difference." "I conclude observations one remark. It appears me, although Almighty thought proper vary intellectual reasoning powers animals way he varied species forms, yet even arrangement he unmindful interest welfare man. For observe, reasoning powers chiefly, wholly, given animals man subjects his service his use--the elephant, horse, dog; thereby making animals value, powers given service control man." CHAPTER FIFTY FIVE. On Monday morning, William Ready went away boat, before, bring round various articles cove. It arranged return till Saturday evening, dog Remus bring intelligence welfare every afternoon. They worked hard week, Saturday completed task; exception portion timbers ship, everything brought round, carried storehouse, required time. On Saturday morning, went last time cove, Ready selected heavy oak timber quantity lying beach, part put boat, remainder towed astern. It heavy load, although wind fair sail back bay, boat went slowly water. "Well, William," said Ready, "we done good week's work, I must say high time done; boat rather crazy condition, I must contrive patch her by, time." "We shall want use her much this, Ready," replied William; "a trips round little harbour required come back old quarters." "That is true, William; she leaks much, events I will give her coat pitch soon possible. For slight-built little thing she is, she done hard duty." "Pray, Ready, why, speak ship boat, always call she?" "Well, William, I do not know why, certain sailors always so. I believe sailor loves his ship. His ship his wife, common saying us; see, Master William, vessel almost thing life appearance. I believe that is reason, course vessel she, little boat must she also." "Well, I think explained well, Ready. I suppose Monday shall set storehouse, alter future residence?" "Cannot begin soon, William," replied Ready; "I do not doubt Mr Seagrave finished hedge ditch round yams time, so, I expect Madam like left tents alone Juno children, shall move back house altered storehouse; I must say I would rather mamma remained tents finished." "Because afraid visit savages, Ready?" "I am, sir, that is truth." "But, Ready, come, shall see coming, would better together, even obliged conceal consequence prepared? Suppose savages overrun island, find mother, little brother, sister, defenceless, time obliged retreat house; dreadful would be!" "But I counted upon retreating tents." "So together, unless surprised night." "That must take care be. There is three hours' dark season year. Well, William, I doubt may right, us, Juno great help, shall get work faster." "We better let question decided father mother." "Very true, William; here is point last. We haul timber beach, fast can, getting late." It was, indeed, much later usually arrived little harbour, owing heavy load, made boat long coming round cove; pulled in, found Mr Mrs Seagrave children waiting them. "You late, William," said Mrs Seagrave. "I quite uneasy till I saw boat distance." "Yes, mamma; could help it; heavy load bring round, work done." "I delighted hear it, William; I cannot bear away long." "And work done," said Mr Seagrave; "the hedge ditch finished morning." "Well, then," observed Ready, "we must hold another council, I presume take long." "No; I expect not; seldom people mind. Mrs Seagrave will not left here, Ready, I do not want leave her, I presume Monday start home again." "Yes, sir; please," replied Ready. "Juno, I hope good supper," said William; "for I am hungry." "Yes, Massa William; plenty fried fish; Massa catch  them morning." CHAPTER FIFTY SIX. The next day Sunday day repose, worked hard, felt luxury day rest. In afternoon, agreed Monday make every preparation quitting tents, returning house bay. They decided live stock left there, pasturage plentiful good, exception one goat, would take back them, supply milk; also agreed tents left standing, cooking utensils, case William Ready went round bananas yams, examine live stock, compelled sleep open air, means dressing dinner. William Ready carry beds, etcetera, round bay boat, could two trips, Mr Mrs Seagrave, family, walk woods taking early breakfast. All points arranged, finished supper, William brought conversation animals, he delighted bear Mr Seagrave talk subject. The conversation commenced minutes, William said-- "Papa, always say `as stupid ass.' Is ass stupid animal?" "No, William; sagacious one; character given animal account obstinacy untractableness, account. It usual say, stupid ass, stupid pig, goose. Now, three animals much maligned, sagacious animals. But fact that, regards ass, sorry specimens animal England; stunted small, and, want corn proper food, besides ill-treated, slow dull-looking animals. The climate England much cold ass; south France Mediterranean, much warmer, ass much finer animal; see perfection must go Torrid Zone Guinea, right equator, hottest portion globe, ass, native state native country, handsome creature fleet wind; indeed, supposed be, mentioned Scriptures fleetest animal creation. The fact is, Asia, especially Palestine Syria, asses great repute, used preference horses. We must see animal climate form true estimate value." "Does climate, then, make great difference?" said William. "Of course does, animals, trees, plants, even man, he accustomed change. With respect animals, bear different varieties climate, even change food. The horse, instance, although originally indigenous Arabia, lives well Temperate, even Frigid Zones may said, endure hard winters Russia North America; domestic cattle, cows, sheep, pigs, etcetera. It curious fact that, winter Canada, large proportion food cattle consists _fish_." "Fish, papa! Cows eat fish?" "Yes, dear boy, fact. It remarkable instance graminivorous grass-eating animal changed time flesh-eating, rather fish-eating animal. But animals live temperature, wolf, fox, hare, rabbit. It curious provision,--that sheep goats hottest climates throw warm covering wool, retain little better hair; while, removed cold climate, recover warm covering immediately." "But goat wool, papa." "What Cashmere shawls made of, William?" "Very true, papa." "Most animals certain increase covering recede warm climates cold ones. Wolves foxes, hares rabbits, change colour skins white get far north. The little English stoat, destroyed gamekeepers, becomes beautiful snow-white ermine Russia cold countries." "Well, papa, I think great advantage man, proof Almighty's care kindness him, permitting animals useful able live country; I do not know whether I wrong saying so, papa: I cannot see animal like wolf kept his climate, like lion tiger, ferocious animals." "You started question, William, I glad done, rather remained mind, puzzled you. It true shepherd might agree you, wolf nuisance; equally true husbandman may exclaim, What good thistles, various weeds choke soil? But, dear boy, not, I think are, benefit man, events his doom first transgression. `Cursed ground thy sake--thorns thistles shall bring forth thee--and sweat thy brow shalt thou eat bread,' Almighty's sentence; labour husbandman obtain his crops, watchfulness shepherd guard his flocks. Labour benefit: without exercise would health, without health would enjoyment." "I see now, papa. You mentioned animals live climates; tell us something animals?" "There one remark make, William, is, animals indigenous to, is, originally found in, one portion globe, invariably fashioned fit country, food also proper growing obtained country. Take, instance, camel, animal fashioned expressly country he indigenous, without whose aid communication must stopped Asia Africa. He called `Ship Desert;' desert `sea sand.' His feet fashioned he traverse sands facility; he live upon coarsest vegetable food salt plants found there, he capacity carrying water sort secondary stomach, his supply water found. Here animal wonderfully made Almighty express locality, convenience man country; for, England, elsewhere, he would value. But late, dear William; first thank Him his mercies, bed." CHAPTER FIFTY SEVEN. The next morning one bustle; packing every preparation departure. Juno called called there, obliged ask little Caroline look kettle call her boiled over. Master Tommy, usual, every one's way, harm good his attempts assist. At last, Ready, get rid him, sent large bundle beach. Tommy shouldered great importance, he came back, looking rather warm exertion, Ready asked take another, he said he tired, sat quietly till breakfast-time, everything ready. Mrs Seagrave Juno packed breakfast dinner things basket breakfast over, Mr Mrs Seagrave family set journey, accompanied dogs, cocoa-nut grove. William Ready lost time getting work; crockery, kitchen utensils, table, chairs, first articles put boat. The goat led down, set full load, arrived bay long party walking wood. They landed things beach, shoved bring round bedding, left. By three of the clock afternoon arrived bay second last load, found party hour, Mr Seagrave Juno busy taking articles beach. "Well, William," said Ready, "this last trip time, I expect; much better, little boat must something done her soon I find time." "Yes, indeed, Ready, she done her work well. Do know I feel I coming home, back bay. I really feel quite glad left tents. I found pigeons among peas, Ready, must pick soon can. I think near twenty them. We shall pigeon pies next year, I expect." "If pleases God live well," replied Ready, his eyes fixed upon sea. Before night everything place house, comfortable before, tired, went early bed, first arranged morning. At daylight Ready William went turtle-pond speared turtle, time coming turning turtle again, pond would soon filled. Having cut put portion pot, ready Mrs Seagrave, soon breakfast proceeded storehouse. After little consultation Mr Seagrave, Ready marked square cocoa-nut trees surrounding storehouse, leave space within twenty yards side, considered large enough inclosure. These cocoa-nut trees serve posts fixed cocoa-nut trees cut down, fourteen feet high, form palisade stockade, could climbed over, would protect attack savages. As soon line trees marked out, set work cutting trees within line, outside distance ten yards, give room work. Ready cut cross-pieces, nail tree tree, found advantage saved many large spike nails, without never could made good quick job it. Mr Seagrave cut trees, William Juno sawed proper length one cross-cut saws, carried Ready. They soon cut he could use, dragged away tops branches, piled distance ground, use winter fuel, Mr Seagrave helped Ready fixing palisades. They worked hard day, sorry go bed. Ready, however, took opportunity speak William. "I think," said he, "that again, necessary keep sort night-watch, case accident. I shall go bed till quite dark, nine of the clock, shall glass examine offing last thing. You see, little fear savages coming night-time, may night early morning, one us must daybreak, two three of the clock morning, see anything seen them; not, course may go bed again, cannot arrive till many hours afterwards; must watch wind weather, favourable come us, which, indeed, wind except commencement rainy season may light, would care them. I have thinking it, William, great deal, idea is, beginning rainy season shall visit, one all; see wind do not blow regular one quarter, now, variable, make sail canoes, come easily, instead pulling thirty forty miles, hard work wind current. Still, must careless must keep good look-out even now. I do not want fret father Mrs Seagrave fears subject, I tell I really think, ought do." "I agree you, Ready, I take care daybreak, examine carefully spy-glass soon day dawns. You take night part, I morning part watching." CHAPTER FIFTY EIGHT. For nearly fortnight, work upon stockade continued without intermission, circumstance occurred created greatest alarm excitement. One day, party returned dinner, Mrs Seagrave said surprise, "Why, Tommy you?" "No," replied Mr Seagrave; "he near us day; he went us breakfast, remain quarter hour." "No, Missy; I tell Massa Tommy help carry cocoa-nut leaves, he go away directly." "Goodness! he be?" exclaimed Mrs Seagrave, alarmed. "I dare say he picking shells beach, madam," replied Ready, "or perhaps he garden. I go see." "I see him--oh, mercy!--I see him," said Juno, pointing her finger; "he boat, boat go sea!" It true: Tommy boat, boat drifted beach, cable's length away it, among breakers. William ran like wind, followed close Mr Seagrave Ready, distance Mrs Seagrave Juno; indeed, time lost, wind shore, short time boat would sea. William, soon he arrived beach, threw his hat jacket dashed water. He already his middle, old Ready, followed him, caught arm said: "William, go back immediately. I insist upon it. Your going good, understand thing well I do; go I will, double risk nothing. Mr Seagrave, order back. He obey you. I insist upon it, sir." "William," said Mr Seagrave, "come back immediately, I command you." William obeyed, he clear water Ready swam across first rocks reef, dashing pools rocks, towards boat. "Oh, father!" said William, "if good old man lost, I shall never forgive myself. Look, father, one--two--three sharks, here, close us. He chance. See, he deep water. God protect him!" In meantime, Mr Seagrave, whose wife his side, glancing his eye moment sharks, within feet beach, kept his gaze steadily upon Ready's movements. If he passed passage deep water rocks he might considered safe, boat beating reef side, water shallow. It moment intense anxiety. At last Ready gained reef, his hands upon rocks, climbing them. "He safe, he not?" whispered Mrs Seagrave faintly. "Yes; I think he is," replied Mr Seagrave, Ready gained footing rocks, water little his ankles. "I think deep water boat." In another minute Ready rocks, seized gunnel boat. "He boat," cried William. "Thank God!" "Yes, must thank God, fervently," replied Mr Seagrave. "Look monsters," continued he, pointing sharks; "how quick swim fro; scented prey water. It fortunate here." "See, he boat-hook, pushing boat reef deep water. Oh! he quite safe now." Such, however, case. The boat beating rocks reef, knocked hole her bottom, soon Ready forced boat deep water, she began fill immediately. Ready pushed hard he could boat-hook, tearing his neck-cloth, forced much he could hole. This saved them; boat thwarts water, least motion part Ready, even Tommy, would upset her immediately, still pass deep water reef beach, sharks swimming. Ready, perceived his danger, called throw large stones sharks fast could, drive away. This immediately done Mr Seagrave William, aided Juno Mrs Seagrave. The pelting stones desired effect. The sharks swam away, Ready passed beach, boat grounded she gunnel water, turn over. He handed Tommy, dreadfully frightened he could cry. As soon Ready landed, William sprang his arms, crying, "Thank God, safe, Ready!" Mrs Seagrave, overpowered her feelings, sank her head upon William's shoulder, burst tears. "It touch go, William," observed Ready, walked house, preceded Mr Mrs Seagrave. "How much mischief may created thoughtless boy! However, one cannot put old heads young shoulders, Tommy must forgiven." "He punished enough, far fright goes," replied William; "I will answer it, he will never get boat himself." "No, I think not. But now, William, saw nearly I swamped boat; indeed, his mercy I preserved; taking question merely far endeavours could help us, think gained boat instead me, would brought her beach I did?" "No, Ready; I never could managed her skilfully did, therefore I must swamped I got shore." "Well, William, I old sailor not, therefore vanity makes say could managed boat well I did. Now, I three four seconds spare, you, say, must swamped. I mention prove I right desiring father order back." "Certainly, Ready; Tommy brother, I felt duty risk life him." "A proper feeling, William; duties, are, look father mother, comfort solace them. Your life valuable mine. I old man brink grave, year two makes difference, life is, I hope, consequence." That evening prayers usually solemn, thanksgivings heartfelt sincere. Exhausted exciting scene day, retired early bed. CHAPTER FIFTY NINE. When Tommy questioned following morning his inducement get boat, great surprise he replied, he wanted go round tents again, see bananas ripe; he intended eat back dinner-time, he might found out. "I suspect, Tommy, would hungry ate bananas perceived you," said Ready. "I will not go boat more," said Tommy. "I rather think keep resolution, Tommy," replied Mr Seagrave; "however, I must leave mother point danger yourself, placed others folly." The stockade almost finished; door occasion good deal consultation; last, agreed would better door stout oak plank, second door-posts inside, foot apart door, could inserted short poles one other, barricade within required. This would make door strong portion stockade. As soon complete, storehouse altered dwelling-house, taking away wattles cocoa-nut boughs sides, filling logs cocoa-nut trees. Before week ended stockade door complete, began fell trees, form sides house. This rapid work; Mr Seagrave, William, Juno felled trees, brought wheels side stockade, ready cut proper lengths, Ready employed flooring house part deal planks brought round cove. But week obliged break two days, collect crops garden. A fortnight passed away continual hard work, house last finished, complete, compared one residing in. It much larger, divided three rooms deal planking: middle room door opened sitting eating room, window behind; two side rooms sleeping-rooms, one Mrs Seagrave children, male portion family. "See, William," said Ready, alone, "what able means deal planks; why, floored house, run partitions, would taken us half year saw wood." "Yes; comfort many shelves about. When shall shift house?" "The sooner better. We plenty work still do, work outside stockade." "And propose old house?" said William. "We better put stores least value present, fit another storehouse inside stockade." "Then we will put casks in, take great deal room." "All large one, William; shall want that. I shall fix corner." "What for, Ready?" "To put water in." "But closer spring house." "I know that; but, perhaps, may able go stockade, shall want water." "I understand, Ready; thoughtful are!" "If age I think little, William, would odd. You do not know anxious I see inside defence." "But come in, Ready?" "Why, sir, still plenty work, I like press matter, lest mamma fidgeted, think danger; danger is; I kind forewarning it. I wish would propose come once; standing-bed places ready, except canvas, I shall nail new to-night." In consequence conversation, William proposed dinnertime next day go new house, much handy work live time. Mr Seagrave opinion, Mrs Seagrave thought better everything tidy first. "Why, madam," said Ready, "the way get things tidy go make so. Nothing ever place unless put in." "Well, Ready," said Mrs Seagrave, "since well rest, I give up, please shift to-morrow." "Indeed, madam, I think better; last month fine weather, shall plenty do." "Be so, Ready; best judge; to-morrow take quarters stockade." "Thank God!" muttered Ready softly. The next day fully employed changing residence, shifting bedding utensils; night slept within stockade. Ready run neat little outhouse plank, kitchen Juno, another week fully employed follows: stores divided; least consequence, salt provisions, flour, garden produce, etcetera, put old house; casks powder cartridges also put security; cask beef, pork, flour, iron-work nails, canvas, etcetera, stowed away present new house, had, built storehouse, raised four feet ground make shelter stock. This spacious, and, course, quite dry, contained wished put in. Ready also took care, degrees, fill large water-butt full water, fixed bottom spigot drawing water off. "Well, Mr Seagrave," said Ready Saturday, "we done good many hard weeks' work lately, last them. We comfortably settled new house: stores cover, safe weather, may take things little easier. William I must repair boat, may take trip round examine stock yams get on." "And bananas guavas," said Tommy. "Why, quite forgotten them," observed Mrs Seagrave. "Yes, madam; busy, wonder; however, may left yet, I go round soon boat able swim, bring I find." "We must put seeds potatoes rainy season, Ready." "It better, sir, find time, shall much fine weather now; events, get intervals weather fine. Now I shall go rounds turtle. Good-night, madam,--good-night, sir. Come, William." William Ready succeeded turning six turtles add stock, taken careful survey telescope, came back, fastened door stockade, went bed. CHAPTER SIXTY. Another week passed away, Ready repaired boat, William Mr Seagrave employed digging garden. It also busy week house, washed linen time. Mrs Seagrave Juno, even little Caroline hard work, Tommy useful ever he been, going water required it, watching little Albert. Indeed, he active, Mrs Seagrave praised his papa, Tommy quite proud. On Monday William Ready set boat little harbour, found stock well. Many bananas guavas ripened withered, enough left fill boat half full. "We cannot better leave stock present, William; run cocoa-nut grove shelter storm, feed enough ten times many." "Yes; dig yams first?" "I quite forgotten it, William. I go spade." Having procured yams, set return. Before arrived bay, sky clouded threatened storm. It not, however, rain till landed, small shower announced commencement rainy season. The fruit welcome them, long since tasted any. The following day beautifully fine, everything appeared refreshed rain fallen. It was, however, agreed, Ready William go round next morning, bring home tents, many yams boat could carry. William Ready went night usual, Ready observed wind chopped round eastward. "That bad us to-morrow, Ready," replied William. "We may sail harbour, shall pull back loaded boat." "I trust worse that, events," replied Ready; "but must return, go bed. I shall daylight, need wake without like." "I cannot help waking," replied William, "and I shall, therefore, you." "Very well, I always glad company." The next morning, day dawned, Ready William unfastened door stockade, went beach. The wind still eastward, blowing rather fresh, sky cloudy. As sun rose, Ready, usual, his telescope him, looked offing eastward. As he kept spy-glass his eye time without speaking, William said: "Do see anything, Ready, look long direction?" "Either old eyes deceive me, I fear I do," replied Ready; "but minutes decide." There bank clouds horizon eastward, soon sun risen them, Ready, telescope fixed direction, said: "Yes, William, I right. I thought dark patches I saw brown grass sails." "Sails what, Ready?" said William, hastily. "Of Indian canoes; I knew would come. Take glass look yourself; eye quite dim straining long." "Yes, I now," replied William, his eye glass. At last he said: "Why, twenty thirty them, Ready, least." "And twenty thirty men too, William." "What must do, Ready? How frightened poor mother be! I am afraid nothing number." "Yes, William, great deal, must great deal. That hundreds savages doubt; recollect stockade, cannot easily climb over, plenty firearms ammunition, make good fight it, perhaps beat off, nothing clubs spears." "How fast come down, Ready; why, hour." "No, sir, two hours either; large canoes. However, time lost. While I watch minutes till I make clearly out, run house beckon father come me; then, William, get muskets ready, bring casks powder, made-up cartridges, old house stockade. Call Juno, she help you. We shall time enough everything. After done that, better come join us." In minutes William ran house, Mr Seagrave made his appearance. "Ready, danger, I am sure; William would tell me, I presume, he afraid alarming his mother. What it?" "It is, Mr Seagrave, savages coming upon us large force; perhaps five six hundred them; shall defend might main." "Do think chance force?" "Yes, sir, God's help I doubt shall beat off; must fight hard, days, I fear." Mr Seagrave examined fleet canoes glass. "It is, indeed, dreadful odds contend against." "Yes, sir, three muskets behind stockade almost match clubs spears, provided none us wounded." "Well, Ready, must put trust Lord, best; I second utmost power, William, I am sure, his duty." "I think, sir," said Ready, "we better wait more, long prepare them. We fix strong deal planks inside stockade us stand upon attacked, may see enemy about, able fire upon them. But first better go old house, take provisions articles shall want, roll casks stockade, old house go first, perhaps destroy everything it. The casks certainly will, sake iron hoops. An hour's work great deal. I believe everything want stockade; Juno her fuel, large butt water last us two three weeks least, time, get wheels down, spear couple turtles fresh provisions." These observations made walked house. As soon arrived, found William Juno brought powder cartridges. Mr Seagrave went break matter his wife. "I told I expect this, dear," replied Mrs Seagrave, "so come upon altogether unawares, anything poor weak woman do, I will." "I indeed greatly relieved," said Mr Seagrave, "by finding thus prepared supported. I shall feel anxiety--but work done." Mr Mrs Seagrave joined William, Ready, Juno, already proceeded old house. The children still bed asleep, occasion one watch them. CHAPTER SIXTY ONE. As could good view canoes old house stood, Ready examined his glass every time he returned rolling cask stockade. Every one worked hard; even Mrs Seagrave she could, either assisting rolling casks, carrying she able lift. In hour got stockade cared for, canoes still six seven miles off. "We good hour arrive, sir," said Ready, "and even reefs puzzle little; I doubt disembarked two hours. We plenty time wish do. Juno, go wheels, William, come spear, turtle stockade. Mr Seagrave, I require assistance, kindness get muskets, examine flints, well." "Yes; load them," replied Mrs Seagrave. "Juno I events, ready fire them." "An excellent idea, madam," replied Ready. In half hour six turtles brought Juno William, Ready followed stockade. They rolled casks, upheaded sides stockade, fixed deal planks stand upon, high enough enable see top palisades, fire enemy. Mrs Seagrave shown load musket, Juno taught same. "Now, sir, prepared," said Ready, "and Madam Juno go look little children, get breakfast." As soon children dressed, Mr Seagrave called Ready, outside, watching canoes, went morning devotions, prayed heartily succour time need. They breakfasted haste; for, may supposed, almost anxious eat. "This suspense worse all," said Mrs Seagrave. "I wish come." "Shall I go Ready hear his report, dear?--I away three minutes." In short time Mr Seagrave returned, saying canoes close beach, savages evidently knowledge passages reefs, steered right in, lowered sails; Ready William look-out, concealed behind cocoa-nut trees. "I hope stay long." "No fear that, dear Selina; better watch motions last minute." During conversation Mr Mrs Seagrave within stockade, William Ready watching motions savages, large portion landed ten canoes, others following example fast could, forcing way reefs. The savages painted, war-cloaks feathers on, armed spears clubs, evidently come peaceable intentions. William, taken telescope examine minutely, said Ready, "What fierce, cruel set wretches appear be; overpower us certainly kill us!" "Of doubt, William; must fight hard, let overpower us. Kill us certainly will, I sure may eat us afterwards; little consequence." William replied determined tone, "I will fight long I breath body; but, Ready, coming fast can." "Yes; must wait longer. Come, William." "I thought I saw another vessel sail, away garden point, Ready, turned away." "Very likely, sir, canoe separated others night. Come, quick, William, begun yell." Another half-minute, arrived door stockade; entered, shut door, barricaded cocoa-nut poles fitted inner door-posts. CHAPTER SIXTY TWO. The loud yells savages struck terror heart Mrs Seagrave; well she seen painted bodies fierce appearance, she would much alarmed. Little Albert Caroline clung around her neck terror faces; cry, looked round round see whence horrid noise proceeded, clung faster mother. Tommy busy, finishing breakfast left, one check usual; Juno busy outside, active courageous. Mr Seagrave employed making holes palisades large enough admit barrels muskets, could fire savages without exposed; William Ready, muskets loaded, look-out approach. "They busy old house now, sir," observed Ready, "but will not detain long." "Here come," replied William; "and look, Ready, one women escaped us canoe, walking along first two men? Yes, is, I sure." "You right, William, one them. Ah! stopped; expect stockade, clear, puzzled them; see crowding together talking; holding council war proceed; tall man must one chiefs. Now, William, although I intend fight hard I can, yet I always feel dislike begin first; I shall therefore show palisades, attack me, I shall fire quiet conscience." "But take care do not hit you, Ready." "No great fear that, William. Here come." Ready stood upon plank within, show savages, gave tremendous yell, advanced dozen spears thrown true aim that, he instantly dodged behind stockade, he must killed. Three four spears remained quivering palisades, top; others went it, fell inside stockade, end. "Now, William, take good aim;" William could fire, Mr Seagrave, agreed stationed corner he might see savages went round side, fired his musket, tall chief fell ground. Ready William also fired, two savages seen drop amidst yells companions. Juno handed muskets ready loaded, took discharged, Mrs Seagrave, desired Caroline take care her little brother, Tommy quiet good, came out, turned key door upon them, hastened assist Juno reloading muskets. The spears rushed air, well could fire stockade without exposing persons, would little chance. The yells increased, savages began attack every quarter; active, climbed like cats, actually succeeded gaining top palisades, but, soon heads appeared above, fired true aim dropped dead outside. This combat lasted hour, savages, lost great many men, drew assault, parties within stockade time breathe. "They gained much bout, events," said Ready; "it well fought side, William, certainly behaved brought it." "Do think go away now?" said Mrs Seagrave. "Oh, no, madam, yet; try us every way leave us. You see brave men, clear know gunpowder is, would astonished." "I think too," replied Mr Seagrave; "the first time savages hear report firearms, usually thrown great consternation." "Yes, sir; case people, therefore I reckon first time fought Europeans." "Are gone, Ready?" said William, come plank his mother. "No; I see trees now; sitting round circle, and, I suppose, making speeches." "Well, I am thirsty, events," said William; "Juno, bring little water." Juno went water-tub comply William's request, moments afterwards came back great consternation. "Oh, Massa! oh, Missy! water; water gone!" "Water gone!" cried Ready breath. "Yes; one little drop cask." "I filled top!" exclaimed Ready gravely; "the tub leak, I sure of; happened?" "Missy, I tink I know now," said Juno; "you remember send Massa Tommy, two three days wash, fetch water well little bucket. You know soon he come back, say good boy he was, tell Massa Seagrave he come dinner. Now, Missy, I quite certain Massa Tommy take trouble go well, fetch water tub while, he empty it." "I am afraid you are right, Juno," replied Mrs Seagrave. "What shall do?" "I go speak Massa Tommy," said Juno, running house. "This awkward thing, Mr Seagrave," observed Ready gravely. Mr Seagrave shook his head. The fact was, perceived danger position: savages leave island, would perish thirst surrender; latter case, lives would certainly sacrificed. Juno returned: her suspicions true. Tommy, pleased praise quick bringing water, taken spigot cask, drawn off. "Well," observed Mr Seagrave, "it Heaven careful arrangements preparations attack defeated idleness child, must submit." "Very true, sir," replied Ready; "all hopes savages may tired out, leave island." "If I little children, I care," observed Mrs Seagrave; "but see poor things suffer--is drop left, Juno, anywhere?" Juno shook her head. Mrs Seagrave said she would go examine, went away house accompanied Juno. "This bad business, Ready," observed Mr Seagrave. "What would give shower rain now, might catch falling drops!" "There signs it, sir," replied Ready; "we must, however, put confidence One forsake us." "I wish savages would come again," observed William; "for sooner come, sooner affair decided." "I doubt to-day; night-time I think probable. We must make preparations it." "Why, do, Ready?" "In first place, sir, nailing planks cocoa-nut tree cocoa-nut tree present stockade, may make great portion much higher, difficult climb over. Some nearly in, time. If that, shall large space watch defend; must contrive large fire ready lighting, may fight altogether dark. It give advantage looking palisades, seeing are, cannot well drive spears through, great matter. We must make fire centre stockade, plenty tar it, make burn bright, must not, course, light attacked. We shall see trying entrance, aim muskets." "The idea good, Ready," said Mr Seagrave; "if unfortunate want water, I really sanguine beating off." "We may suffer much, Mr Seagrave, I doubt; knows morrow may bring forth?" "True, Ready. Do see savages now?" "No, sir; left spot consultation. I suppose busy wounded dead." As Ready supposed, attack made savages day, he, William, Mr Seagrave, busy making arrangements; nailed planks trunks trees stockade, make three sides stockade least five feet higher, almost impossible climb up; prepared large fire tar-barrel full cocoa-nut leaves mixed wood tar, burn fiercely. Dinner supper none, nothing salt pork beef live turtle, and, Ready's advice, eat, would increase desire drink. The poor children suffered much; little Albert wailed cried "water, water." Ready remained look-out; indeed, everything miserable inside house, glad go it; could good, poor Mrs Seagrave difficult painful task keep children quiet severe privation, weather still warm sultry. CHAPTER SIXTY THREE. But moaning children soon dusk drowned yells savages, who, Ready prognosticated, advanced night attack. Every part stockade assailed, attempts made climb it; spears occasionally thrown, evident object obtain entrance dint numbers. It well Ready taken precaution nailing deal planks original stockade, little doubt savages would gained object; was, flames fire, Juno lighted Ready's order, gave sufficient light, three four savages climbed shot William Mr Seagrave, top stockade. When fire burnt brightly, savages outside easily aimed at, great many fell attempts get over. The attack continued hour, last, satisfied could succeed, savages withdrew, carrying them, before, dead wounded. "I trust re-embark, leave island," said Mr Seagrave. "I wish may, sir; impossible; saying. I thinking, Mr Seagrave, might able ascertain movements making look-out. You see, sir, cocoa-nut tree," continued Ready, pointing one palisades fastened, "is much taller others: now, driving spike-nails trunk foot apart, might ascend ease, would command view whole bay; could know enemy about." "Yes, true; anyone much exposed he climbs up?" "No, sir; see cocoa-nut trees cut clear palisades distance, savage could come near without seen anyone look-out, giving us sufficient time get he could use his spear." "I believe right there, Ready; events I would attempt daylight, may still lurking underneath stockade." "Certainly may be, sir, therefore daylight begin." Mr Seagrave went house; Ready desired William lie sleep two three hours, he would watch. In morning, Mr Seagrave came out, he would little sleep himself. "I cannot sleep, Ready. I am mad thirst," replied William. "Yes, sir; it is painful--I feel much, must poor children feel? I pity most." "I pity mother most, Ready," replied William; "it must agony her witness sufferings, able relieve them." "Yes, indeed, must terrible, William, mother's feelings; perhaps savages to-morrow, shall forget privations." "I trust God may, Ready, seem determined." "Yes, sir; iron gold them, civilised men gold?" In meantime, Mr Seagrave gone house. He found children still crying water, notwithstanding coaxing soothing Mrs Seagrave, shedding tears she hung poor little Albert. Little Caroline drooped, said nothing. Mr Seagrave remained two three hours his wife, assisting her pacifying children, soothing her utmost his power; last he went found old Ready watch. "Ready, I rather hundred times attacked savages defend place, house even five minutes, witness sufferings wife children." "I doubt it, sir," replied Ready; "but cheer up, let us hope best; I think probable savages second defeat leave island." "I wish I could think so, Ready; would make happy; I come take watch, Ready. Will sleep while?" "I will, sir, please, take little sleep. Call two hours; daylight, I go work, get repose yourself." "I anxious sleep; I think so, least." "William said he thirsty sleep, sir, but, poor fellow, he fast enough." "I trust boy spared, Ready." "I hope too; hands Almighty." Mr Seagrave took his station plank, left his reflections; pleasant kind may easily imagined. He prayed earnestly fervently might delivered danger sufferings threatened them, became calm tranquil; prepared worst, worst happen, confidently placing his family care orders he thinks best. At daylight Ready woke relieved Mr Seagrave, return house, lay cocoa-nut boughs, Ready lying side William. As soon Ready got spike-nails hammer, he summoned William his assistance, commenced driving cocoa-nut tree, one looking case savages approaching, work. In less hour gained top tree close boughs, commanding view bay, well inland. William, driving last dozen spikes, took survey, came Ready. "I see everything, Ready: pulled old house altogether, lying outside, covered war-cloaks; women walking fro canoes, lying beach first landed." "They pulled house obtain iron nails, I doubt," replied Ready. "Did see dead?" "No; I look much, I go directly. I came hands jarred hammering, hammer heavy carry. In minute two I shall go light enough. My lips burning, Ready, swelled; skin peeling off. I idea want water would dreadful. I hopes finding cocoa-nut two tree, one." "And found one, would milk season year. However, William, savages go away to-day, something must done. I wish would go again, see stirring." William mounted top tree, remained minutes; he came down, he said, "They now, swarming like bees. I counted 260 men war-cloaks feather head-dresses; women passing fro well water; nobody canoes except eight ten women, beating heads, I think, something kind. I could make well, seem thing." "I know about, William: cutting knives sharp instruments. It custom people. The dead put canoes, women lamenting them; perhaps going away, since dead canoes, saying." CHAPTER SIXTY FOUR. The second day passed keeping look-out upon savages, awaiting fresh attack. They could perceive top cocoa-nut tree savages held council war forenoon, sitting round large circle, one got centre made speech, flourishing his club spear he spoke. In afternoon council broke up, savages observed busy directions, cutting cocoa-nut trees, collecting brushwood. Ready watched long while, last came little sunset. "Mr Seagrave," said he, "we shall have, opinion, attack night, to-morrow must expect something serious; savages cutting trees, making large faggots; get fast, hatchets made stone do not cut well, perseverance numbers effect everything, I dare say work night till obtained many faggots want." "But imagine object, Ready, cutting trees, making faggots?" "Either, sir, pile outside palisades, large able walk upon them, else pile set fire them, burn us out." "Do think succeed?" "Not without heavy loss; perhaps may best off, hard fight; harder yet. We must women load muskets, may fire fast can. I think much attempt burn us, smoke. Cocoa-nut wood, especially bark on, palisades have, char long while, burn easily standing upright; fire, faggots kindled, although fierce, last long." "But suffering now, Ready, want water, possibly keep strength meet suffocating smoke flame? must drop sheer exhaustion." "We must hope best, best, Mr Seagrave," replied Ready; "and recollect anything happen conflict, chance overpowered, must take advantage smoke escape woods, find way tents. I doubt able that; course attack windward use fire, must try escape leeward; I shown William force palisade necessary. The savages, get possession, think looking first, and, perhaps, obtained house contains, even afterwards." "Why say accident happens you, Ready?" said William. "Because, William, place faggots able walk top palisades, I may wounded killed, may you." "Of course," replied William; "but yet, shall hard fight it." Ready told Mr Seagrave he would keep watch, call twelve of the clock. During two days, eaten little; turtle killed, pieces fried, eating added thirst, even children refused meat. The sufferings really dreadful, poor Mrs Seagrave almost frantic. As soon Mr Seagrave gone house, Ready called William, said, "William, water must have. I cannot bear see agony poor children, state mind poor mother in; more, without water never shall able beat savages to-morrow. We shall literally die choking smoke, use fire. Now, William, I intend take one seven-gallon barricos, go well water. I may succeed, I may not, attempt I must, I fall cannot helped." "Why let go, Ready?" replied William. "For many reasons, William," said Ready; "and chief one I think would succeed well I shall. I shall put war-cloak feathers savage fell dead inside stockade, disguise, I shall take arms except his spear, would way, increase weight I carry. Now observe, must let door, I out, case accident put one poles across inside; keep door fast, attack it, secure others. Watch return, ready let in. Do understand me?" "Yes, perfectly, Ready; I now, I must confess, really frightened; anything happen you, misery would be!" "There help it, William. Water must, possible, procured, better time make attempt later, may watch; left work, busy eating; I meet one, woman." Ready went barrico, little cask, held six seven gallons water. He put head-dress war-cloak savage; and, taking barrico his shoulder, spear his hand, poles barred door softly removed William, ascertaining one concealed beneath palisades, Ready pressed William's hand, set across cleared space outside stockade, gained cocoa-nut trees. William, directed, closed door, passed one pole inner door-posts security, remained watch. He awful state suspense, listening slightest noise, even slight rustling wind cocoa-nut boughs made start; he continued minutes, his gun ready cocked his side. It time he returned, thought William; distance 100 yards, yet I heard noise. At last he thought he heard footsteps coming softly. Yes, so. Ready returning, without accident. William his hand upon pole, slip one side open door, he heard scuffle fall close door. He immediately threw pole, opened Ready called name. William seized his musket sprang out; he found Ready struggling savage, uppermost, his spear Ready's breast. In second William levelled fired, savage fell dead. "Take water quick, William," said Ready faint voice. "I contrive crawl I can." William caught barrico water, took in; he hastened Ready, his knees. Mr Seagrave, hearing musket fired, run out, finding stockade door open, followed William, seeing endeavouring support Ready, caught hold his arm, led tottering stockade; door immediately secured, went his assistance. "Are hurt, Ready?" said William. "Yes, dear boy, yes; hurt death, I fear: his spear went breast. Water, quick, water!" "Alas! some," said Mr Seagrave. "We have, papa," replied William; "but cost us dearly." William ran pannikin, taking bung, poured water barrico gave Ready, drank eagerness. "Now, William, lay cocoa-nut boughs; go give water others, drunk, come again. Do not tell Mrs Seagrave I am hurt. Do I beg you." "Papa, take water--do pray," replied William; "I cannot leave Ready." "I will, boy," replied Mr Seagrave; "but first drink yourself." William, faint, drank pannikin water, immediately revived him, then, Mr Seagrave hastened water children women, occupied old Ready, breathed heavily, speak. CHAPTER SIXTY FIVE. After returning twice water, satisfy house, Mr Seagrave came assistance William, removing Ready's clothes ascertain nature wound he received. "We better move cocoa-nut boughs lie; he comfortable there," said William. Ready whispered, "More water." William gave then, assistance his father, Ready removed comfortable place. As soon laid there, Ready turned his side, threw quantity blood. "I better now," said he low voice; "bind wound, William; old man like much blood spare." Mr Seagrave William examined wound; spear gone deep lungs. William threw his shirt, tore strips, bound wound stop effusion blood. Ready, first appeared much exhausted moved about, gradually recovered able speak low voice, Mrs Seagrave came house. "Where brave, kind man?" cried she, "that I may bless thank him." Mr Seagrave went her, caught her arm. "He hurt, dear; much hurt. I tell time." Mr Seagrave related occurred, led her Ready lying. Mrs Seagrave knelt his side, took his hand, burst tears. "Do not weep me," said Ready; "my days numbered; I am sorry I cannot useful you." "Dear good man," said Mrs Seagrave, "whatever may fates, Almighty decide us, long I life, done mine shall never forgotten." Mrs Seagrave bent him, kissing his forehead, rose retired weeping house. "William," said Ready, "I cannot talk now; raise head little, leave me. You looked round lately. Come half hour. Leave now, Mr Seagrave; I shall better I doze little." They complied Ready's request; went planks, examined carefully round stockade; last stopped. "This sad business, William," said Mr Seagrave. William shook his head. "He would let go," replied he; "I wish he had. I fear he much hurt." "I say he cannot recover, William. We shall miss to-morrow attack us." "I hardly know say, papa; I feel since relieved, I able twice much I could done before." "I feel same, still force us, two people cannot much." "If mother Juno load muskets us," replied William, "we shall events much able three, exhausted been." "Perhaps so; events best, fight lives dear us." William went softly Ready, found he dozing; he therefore disturb him, returned his father. Now thirst appeased, felt calls hunger. Juno William went cut steaks turtle, fried them; made hearty meal, perhaps never taken one much relish lives. It nearly daylight, William, several times softly Ready, found his eyes open. "How find yourself, Ready?" said William. "I quiet easy, William, without much pain; I think I sinking, shall last long. Recollect obliged escape stockade, take heed me, leave I am. I cannot live, move me, I die sooner." "I rather die you, leave you, Ready." "No, wrong; must save mother, brothers sister; promise I wish." William hesitated. "I point duty, William. I know feelings are, must give way them; promise this, make miserable." William squeezed Ready's hand; his heart full speak. "They come daylight, William; much time spare; climb look-out, wait till day dawns; watch long can, come tell seen." Ready's voice became faint exertion speaking much. William immediately climbed cocoa-nut tree, waited till daylight. At dawn day, he perceived savages work, collected faggots together opposite old house stood, busy making arrangements attack. At last, every one shouldered faggot, commenced advance towards stockade; William immediately descended called his father, talking Mrs Seagrave. The muskets loaded, Mrs Seagrave Juno took posts planking, reload fast fired. "We must fire upon soon sure missing, William," said Mr Seagrave, "for check advance, better." When first savages within fifty yards, fired, two men dropped; continued fire assailants came up, great success first ten minutes; savages advanced larger body, took precaution hold faggots front them, protection approached. By means gained stockade safety, commenced laying faggots. Mr Seagrave William still kept incessant fire upon them, much success before. Although many fell, faggots gradually heaped up, till almost reached holes palisades, pointed muskets; savages contrived slope stockade ground, evident meant mount take escalade. At last, appeared faggots placed, savages retired farther back, cocoa-nut trees still standing. "They gone away, father," said William; "but come again, I fear us." "I fear too, boy," replied Mr Seagrave; "they retreating arrange general assault, able gain entrance. I almost wish fired faggots; might escaped Ready pointed us, I fear chance." "Do not say word mother," said William; "let us defend last, overpowered God." "I like take farewell embrace dear mother," said Mr Seagrave; "but, no; weakness now. Here come, William, swarm. Well, God bless you, boy; shall all, I trust, meet Heaven!" The whole body savages advancing cocoa-nut wood solid mass; raised yell, struck terror hearts Mrs Seagrave Juno, yet flinched not. The savages within fifty yards them, fire opened upon them; fire answered loud yells, savages already reached bottom sloping pile faggots, yells reports muskets drowned much louder report, followed crackling breaking cocoa-nut trees, made parties start surprise; another another followed, ground ploughed up, savages fell numbers. "It must cannon ship, father," said William; "we saved-- saved!" "It nothing else; saved, miracle!" replied Mr Seagrave utter astonishment. The savages paused advance, quite stupefied; again, again, again, report loud guns boomed air, round-shot grape came whizzing tearing cocoa-nut grove; last broadside, savages turned, fled towards canoes: one left seen. "We saved!" cried Mr Seagrave, leaping plank embracing his wife, sank her knees, held her clasped hands thankfulness Heaven. William hastened look-out cocoa-nut tree, cried below, guns discharged: "A large schooner, father; she firing savages, canoes; falling every direction: plunged water; boat full armed men coming shore; close beach, garden-point. Three canoes got full men; go guns again; two canoes sunk, father; boat landed, people coming way." William descended look-out fast he could. As soon he down, he commenced unbarring door stockade. He pulled last pole he heard feet deliverers outside. He threw open door, and, second after, found arms Captain Osborn. CHAPTER SIXTY SIX. Before wind history, well state young readers Captain Osborn made his appearance fortunate moment. It recollected brig came island months this, great disappointment party island experienced her making her appearance again. The fact was, board brig seen signals, read name "_Pacific_" upon flag hoisted; heavy gale came drove far southward, master brig consider he his duty his owners, he lost much time beating island again. He therefore decided upon making sail Sydney, port he bound. When Captain Osborn put boat Mackintosh seamen _Pacific_, he still insensible; he gradually recovered, stormy night, Captain Osborn far recovered hear Mackintosh taken place, he found open boat sea. The next morning wind moderated, fortunate enough fall vessel bound Van Diemen's Land, took board. From account given Mackintosh, Captain Osborn doubt his mind Seagrave family perished, loss vessel, board, duly reported owners. When Van Diemen's Land, Captain Osborn much taken beauty fertility country, perhaps well inclined go sea danger he incurred last voyage, he resolved purchase land settle there. He so, already stocked his farm cattle, gone round Sydney schooner await arrival large order England he sent for, brig arrived reported existence white people small island, also hoisted flag name _Pacific_ worked it. Captain Osborn, hearing this, went master brig, questioned him. He found latitude longitude island far ship she deserted, he convinced that, miracle, Seagrave family preserved. He therefore went Governor New South Wales, made acquainted facts established, Governor instantly replied, government armed schooner his service, he would go quest his former shipmates. Inconvenient absence time Captain Osborn, he acquiesced, days schooner sailed her destination. She arrived island morning fleet canoes savages effected landing, William made remark Ready hastening stockade, another vessel sail garden-point, Ready time put his eye telescope, he would discovered schooner. The schooner stood reefs, hauled again, she might send her boat sound anchorage. The boat, sounding, perceived canoes savages, afterwards heard report firearms first attack. On her return board schooner, stated seen heard, idea white people island attacked savages. As boat return board till near dusk, time canvas, question night attack made, heard firing muskets. This made Captain Osborn anxious land soon possible, savages numbers, crew schooner consist twenty-five men, commander considered rash make attempt. He did, however, show utmost anxiety bring his schooner anchor, protect his men, agreed land. The boat reported deep water good anchorage close garden-point, every preparation made running daylight following morning; unfortunately, fell calm best part day, morning after, savages making last attack upon stockade, she could get in. As soon she did, she opened fire her carronades, result already known. My readers must, can, imagine joy Mr Mrs Seagrave beheld old friend Captain Osborn. All danger over; party landed went command mate, ascertain savages found; but, except dead dying, escaped smaller canoes. Captain Osborn remained Seagraves, informed state poor old Ready, William gone attend soon Captain Osborn engaged his father mother. Captain Osborn hurried see him; Ready knew his voice, his eyes already dim he could see. "That Captain Osborn, I know," said Ready faint voice. "You come good time, sir; I knew would come, I always said so: thanks dying man." "I hope bad that, Ready; surgeon board, I send once." "No surgeon help me, sir," replied Ready; "another hour time pass I shall Eternity." The old man joined his hands across his breast, remained time silent prayer. Then he bade farewell faint voice, last changed mere whisper. They still remained, silence tears, standing round him, William kneeling holding his hand, old man's head fell back, he more! "It over," said Mr Seagrave mournfully, "and he has, I doubt, gone receive reward good man. `Happy die Lord.'" Mr Seagrave led away his wife children, leaving Juno William. William closed his eyes, Juno went fetched ship's ensign, laid body, joined rest party house. It decided following day passed packing getting board luggage, day family embark. William mentioned wish poor old Ready his burial. The commander schooner immediately gave directions coffin made, his men dig grave spot William point out. CHAPTER SIXTY SEVEN. The hurry bustle preparing departure island, rapid succession events crowded together within days, allowed time much thought reflection Mr Mrs Seagrave William; length, however, every preparation made, longer urged commander schooner hasten packing arrangements; everything sent board afternoon, proposed sail following day. Now time feel, bitterly lament loss old friend, deplore he survived sail Sydney. They always indulged hope one day taken island, hope ever looked forward old Ready becoming part future household. Now wishes granted--so much feeling joy gratitude mingled regret--that could he restored them, felt would gladly remained island. Captain Osborn, commander, crew schooner taken leave night, gone board, made arrangements interment Ready, previous sailing, following day. The children put bed, Juno quitted house; Mr Mrs Seagrave William sitting together half-dismantled room, Juno entered; poor girl evidently weeping. "Well, Juno," observed Mr Seagrave, view break silence continued time previous her entrance, "are glad leave island?" "One time I think I would glad, I care much," replied Juno. "Island nice place, happy till savage come. Suppose kill old Ready, I care." "Yes, indeed," said Mrs Seagrave, "it sad blow us all; I hope fostered good old man, able shown gratitude, but--" "It Heaven otherwise," continued Mr Seagrave; "I would give half I possessed of, he perished." "Oh, Massa!" said Juno, "I sit now; I take flag look his face, calm, look happy, good, I almost tink he smile me, I cry. Oh! Massa Tommy, idle boy." "It adds much regret," replied Mr Seagrave, "that his life sacrificed thoughtlessness one children; lesson Tommy he old enough comprehend consequences his conduct." "That he must know, papa," said William, leaning mournfully table; "one Ready's last injunctions Tommy never told it." "His last wishes shall religiously attended to, dear boy," replied Mr Seagrave; "for owe good old man? When others deserted us left us perish, he remained us share fate. By his skill saved landed safety. He provided wants, added comforts, instructed us make best use means. Without his precautions perished spears savages. What example Christian fortitude humility he ever show us! indeed, I may truly say, his example, sinful I must ever be, I become, I trust, better man. Would he sitting us,--but Lord's done!" "I feel I lost stay prop," replied Mrs Seagrave. "So accustomed I look advice since island. Had he thus snatched us--had he spared us years, permitted surround his death-bed, close his eyes peace--" Mrs Seagrave wept upon shoulder her husband. After time, Mrs Seagrave recovered herself; silence ensued, broken occasional sob poor Juno. William's heart full; he could long utter word; last he said low voice: "I feel that, next dear father mother, I lost best friend. I cannot forgive allowing go water; duty go, I ought gone." "And yet could ill spared you, dear boy; might perished," replied Mrs Seagrave. "It would God willed," replied William; "I might perished, I might not." "We never know morrow may bring forth," said Mr Seagrave, "or may store us. Had misfortune happened, old Ready spared us, joyfully I quitted island, full anticipation, indulging worldly prospects. What check I received! I thought anxiety. I said myself, `we happy island; wants supplied; even comforts great. We temptations, isolated world; I sure I shall happy future I been? Am I confident, long-wished-for return world take place, I shall lament I ever quitted peaceful, quiet spot?' I feel duty family I return society, I far feeling happiness may increased. We have, however, plain precept follow, is, duty state life pleased God call us." "Yes," replied Mrs Seagrave; "I feel truth said. We his hands; let us put trust him." "We will," replied Mr Seagrave; "but late, rise early to-morrow morning. This last evening shall pass island; let us return thanks happiness enjoyed here. We thought quitted spot joy,--it his leave sorrow." Mr Seagrave took Bible, he read chapter, he poured forth prayer suited feelings, retired repose. The next morning early, packed articles still remained go board. Mr Seagrave read prayers, went breakfast. Few words exchanged, solemn grief upon them. They waited arrival Captain Osborn crew schooner attend funeral poor old Ready. William, gone occasionally look vessel, came in, said two boats pulling shore. A minutes afterwards, Captain Osborn commander schooner soon made appearance. The coffin brought shore; body Ready put it, screwed down. In half hour prepared, family summoned house. The coffin, covered Union Jack pall, raised shoulders six seamen, bore grave, followed Mrs Seagrave children, commander schooner, several men. Mr Seagrave read funeral service, grave filled up, walked back silence. At request William, commander schooner ordered carpenter prepare oak paling put round grave, board written name deceased day his death. As soon fixed up, William, deep sigh, followed commander schooner house announce finished, boat waited embark. "Come, dear," said Mr Seagrave his wife. "I will, I will," replied Mrs Seagrave, "but I do not know is, hour come, I really feel pain quitting dear island. Had poor Ready's death, I really think I wish remain." "I do not doubt feel sorrow, dear, must keep Captain Osborn waiting." As Mr Seagrave aware commander schooner anxious get clear islands night, he led his wife boat. They embarked, soon deck schooner, whence continued fix eyes upon island, men heaving anchor. At last sail made upon vessel, garden-point cleared, and, ran away fair wind, object shore became indistinct. Still eyes turned direction. As ran westward, passed cove first landed, Mr Seagrave directed Mrs Seagrave's attention it. She remained time looking silence, said she turned away: "We shall never happy island, Seagrave." "It indeed well, dear, never less happy," replied her husband. The schooner ran fast water, island every minute less distinct; time, land horizon, tops cocoa-nut trees seen; gradually disappeared. Juno watched on, last nothing could seen, she waved her handkerchief direction island, bid farewell, went hide her grief. The wind continued fair, and, favourable passage little four weeks, arrived Sydney Cove, port bound embarked England board good ship Pacific. PS. As young readers probably wish know little Seagrave family, I inform Mr Seagrave, like patriarch Job his tribulation, found his flocks herds greatly increased his arrival Sydney. Mr Mrs Seagrave lived see children grown up. William inherited greater part property his father, many years assisted management it. Tommy, notwithstanding his scrapes, grew fine fellow, entered army. Caroline married young clergyman, made excellent wife; little Albert went navy, present commander. Juno still alive, lives Seagrave plantation William, her greatest pleasure take his children her knee, tell long stories island, make cry she goes history old Ready's death burial.
