For Lord Maltravers he care snap fingers; he delighted think Lena Van Hoosen thought enough send warn danger she fancied he menaced with. When he left house, he walked slowly toward club, he knew he would meet his friends. In reading-room he encountered Dick Harvey, his schoolmate accompanied his wanderings sea land. In arm-chair sat Professor Isaac Mole, his old tutor, fast asleep. "How do, Jack?" exclaimed Harvey. "You see professor little weather. Will come committee-room?

It valuable contribution science, settle vexed question, I invite views members subject." Captain Cannon, stout, plethoric gentleman, soldierly bearing, seen service Rifle Brigade, noted among his friends able tell wildly improbable yarns one else, responded call. "The buffalo great fact," he exclaimed. "When Canada West regiment, I got lost Hudson's Bay territory, subsisted six months buffalo-meat. As far I know, buffalo found east Missouri river, rapidly dying out. Buffaloes are, certain knowledge, sir, used New York drawing street cars. It naturally beast burden tame. When Montreal, I used drive buffalo sleigh; he went well docile. The buffalo's favorite food peanuts; he also thrive pop-corn." The gallant captain sat down, delivering remarkable contribution natural history, Mr. Zebadiah Twinkle rose his feet. "Sir," he exclaimed, looking fiercely President, "I rise point order. There twelve members present, according by-law 27 requires fifteen make quorum." Mr. Twinkle tall angular, he glared defiantly around him. The character Mr. Twinkle remarkable one. He gentleman independent means, retired rich grocery business. His ambition considered sporting character. He great boaster, put test, generally collapsed ludicrous manner. In fact he common parlance fraud blower, he caused great amusement his friends. The entrance moment five additional members club, effectually disposed Mr. Twinkle's point order. "Good!" he said. "Now everything regular, I proceed remarks. As worthy gallant friend Captain Cannon stated, fact buffaloes exist city New York, whenever citizens vast commercial metropolis go sleigh-riding, invariably take buffaloes.

"Mr. President gentlemen Travelers' Club," he exclaimed, "allow state buffalo wild animal, found plains Far West, ranges herds savage state. It may found far south-west Texas, far north Montana." "Is veracity called question?" cried Captain Cannon. "Am I ignoramus?" asked Mr. Twinkle. "Order, gentlemen!" said President, rapping table. "Allow make suggestion," exclaimed Harvey. "As diversity opinion buffalo, members club seem hazy land he lives, I propose committee of--say five--be appointed go America make report." This proposition received favor.

Jack willing enough go America, Miss Van Hoosen also going country, he thought sufficiently well her wish enjoy her society. When settled, meeting adjourned, Jack went apprise Mr. Mole his selection one Buffalo Investigating Committee. The professor still sleeping calmly, he attracted attention Lord Maltravers. This scion aristocracy twenty-five years age, rich extremely haughty. His father died he young. He educated private tutor let his way everything. His mother doted spoilt him. Young, rich, titled, handsome, wonder it, he arrogant thought cast superior mold his fellow-creatures, he despised looked upon. Maltravers hated Jack Harkaway, first place Jack paid deference, secondly he fancied Lena Van Hoosen preferred dashing Jack himself. Knowing Professor Mole friend Jack's he lost opportunity insulting him. Seeing asleep, he twisted piece paper boys call 'jigger,' lighting ends, placed old man's nose. He accompanied young man his toady; his name Simpkins, consideration many favors bestowed upon Lord Maltravers, Simpkins his devoted servant. "Ha! ha!" laughed Simpkins, "what excellent joke; wake old boy up." "He is right sleep club, Jove," remarked his lordship. "Certainly not; proper place." Presently flame began burn skin professor's nasal organ, he awoke cry affright. His hands instinctively sought his nose he pulled 'jigger.' "Confound it," he exclaimed, "my face burnt. Who done this?" The two young men began laugh loudly evidently enjoying practical joke. "I it," said Lord Maltravers. "Is anything else want know?" Mr. Mole regarded indignation. "If I was not old man, I would chastise insolence," he cried. "Do not fall back age," replied Maltravers. "I take consequences anything I may done." A quick step caused turn round. "Are you?" asked voice. It Harkaway, who, standing doorway, silent spectator scene. Lord Maltravers folded his arms. "I ready answer you, one else," he said. The two men regarded one another sternly. CHAPTER II. "THE DUEL ON THE SANDS." Jack Harkaway afraid man living, though averse quarreling, he always supported his friends. "You committed gross outrage Mr. Mole!" he exclaimed; "and his name, I demand apology." "Indeed!" sneered Maltravers. "And more, I mean it." "Is so?" "Apologize, lord, something may--nay, assuredly happen us regret." "You want, sir, I feel inclined give you," replied Maltravers. "I habit apologizing gentleman, think _you_." "That much say I gentleman," exclaimed Jack, hot blood rushing crimson tide his face. "You perfectly liberty place whatever construction like words, sir." Simpkins smiled approval his usual insipid manner. "Bravo!" he lisped. "Very fine, indeed." "I ask more," said Jack, "if make _amende honorable_ friend?" "And I distinctly refuse so." "In case I shall chastise you, I would yelping cur annoyed street. Mind yourself, lord," Jack exclaimed. He raised his fist dealt Maltravers blow vainly endeavored ward off. His lordship fell heavily wall blood flowed cut his face, extended whole length right cheek. "Good heavens!" said Simpkins. "The man butcher. He marked life, Maltravers." The latter applied silk handkerchief his hurt, withdrawing covered hot blood. "Coward!" he exclaimed. "You struck ring finger." "Served right," said Mr. Mole. "I wish he given it. This teach insult old man, never harm." "I talking you, imbecile," hissed Maltravers. He turned his toady: "Give arm, Simpkins," he added. "With pleasure life," reply. "You shall hear me, Mr. Harkaway," continued Maltravers. "Whenever please," answered Jack, carelessly. "I presume refuse satisfaction gentleman." "You rely upon me." His lordship bowed stiffly, and, still holding handkerchief cut, blood trickled slowly, left room. "Am I much hurt, Simpkins?" he asked. "Cut pieces." "Shall I disfigured?" "You always scar, I fear," replied Simpkins. "Curse fellow!" cried Maltravers, his clenched teeth, "he shall pay terrible reckoning this." "Why did not hit back again?" "He took surprise, he hit force, he knocked time. My head swims I dizzy, I feel I faint." They passed door, leaving Jack professor together. The latter shook Harkaway hand warmly. "Many thanks, dear fellow," he exclaimed. "You acted properly punishing man. He made dead-set time past." "On account; I know all," replied Jack. "This row bound come. I warned morning." "Do think he means fight?" "I sure it." "And meet him?" "I see I avoid it. No matter; _vive la bagatelle_, French say. A life adventure me." Jack related Mr. Mole proceedings club selection committee proceed New York. In short time Harvey came in, told quarrel Lord Maltravers, gladly consented act his second, challenge sent. The law England forbade dueling, France, hostile meetings frequently took place, doubt encounter would arranged country. As challenged party, Jack choice weapons resolved choose swords, he expert swordsman. He invited professor Harvey dine his hotel, intending go theater afterward, intention frustrated visit Captain Cannon, sent his card saying he wanted see urgent business. Jack stepped inner room accorded interview. "Very sorry trouble unpleasant matter," said captain. "But Lord Maltravers asked act his friend." "I understand," replied Jack. "You heard unfortunate business." "Surely, blow struck could arranged it. As is, meeting must take place." "Where?" "At Calais, daybreak to-morrow morning." "So soon?" "Yes, useless delay," replied captain. "The express train leaves half-past eight. Who second?" "Mr. Harvey." "Very well. I shall expect hotel, Imperial, arrival. We arrange everything. It simple. I fought dozen duels I age always winged man." "Really!" "Fact, I assure you. Keep courage up." "No fear that," replied Jack. "I hope principal calm I am." "Oh! he will not show white feather," answered Captain Cannon. "The Maltravers blood may bad, is not ounce cowardice it. Good-by, meet to-morrow." Jack nodded, seeing Captain Cannon out, excused Mr. Mole sent Monday, he confided fact he going France fight duel. "You fight jewell, Marse Jack?" said Monday; "what want for?" "It point honor. Do not see? I struck man must give satisfaction." "You leave I put six inches bowie-knife him, suah." Monday's eyes gleamed like cougar, clear he meant he said. "Do not ever talk like again," exclaimed Jack. "I assassin." By half-past eight, Jack Harvey comfortably seated carriage mail train way France. "If I fall," said Jack, "I want see Miss Van Hoosen tell her last thoughts her." "I will it," replied Harvey. "But I think anything happen you." They arrived due course Jack retired rest, Harvey sought Captain Cannon arrange preliminaries. He found captain drinking wine Lord Maltravers talking loudly exploits his youth. "Ah! Harvey," he exclaimed, "here are. Sit join us foaming goblet. That is good phrase I flatter myself. A duel stirs blood carries back long way. I recollect I quartered Dublin, fiery young Hussar took exception something I said threw glass wine face--he did, Jove, sir. That case pistols two coffin one. I met Phoenix Park next day first fire, I shot heart, went expense his body embalmed send home his mother." "Very considerate you, I sure," remarked Harvey. "Oh! it is like me. I am heart. By way, weapons principal select?" "Swords." "Humph! I would rather pistols, affair would sooner; matter. I elegant pair rapiers. We meet six of the clock sands low-water, one mile south town." "That sufficient," answered Harvey. He refused spend night spree captain evidently intended to, returned his hotel. At five of the clock he Jack up, sought appointed spot, finding Lord Maltravers his second already there. In instant principals stripped shirts grasped weapons handed them. The swords highly tempered steel, sharply pointed pliable willow wand. The sun rising east, gilding horizon burning rays. A fishing-smacks lay offing. The tide turn, wavelets plashed mournfully sand, singing requiem. "_En garde_!" cried Maltravers. Jack placed position. His right arm knee advanced, his left hand his side. The swords clashed crossed other, recovering, duelists watched carefully opening. Lord Maltravers lunged _carte_, his thrust delicately foiled his opponent, parried skillfully. A long strip plaster hid cut his lordship's face, ghastly white terribly earnest. For minutes fenced adroitness veteran swordsmen, neither gaining slightest advantage, though hectic spot appeared Maltravers's face, indicated his mind less ease Jack's. Suddenly Jack ceased act defensive became aggressor, breaking his lordship's guard pinking slightly left arm. "First blood!" said Harvey; "are satisfied?" "Confound it, no. This duel death," replied Maltravers, his face distorted passion. "As please," replied Jack. Again, faced one another, wounded man hastily tied piece his shirt sleeve round his arm. The swords clashed bright morning sunshine, every moment became brighter. In vain Maltravers strove injure his enemy. Each thrust parried he panted exertion, tears impotent rage started his eyes. "Ha! I now," he exclaimed, point his rapier touched Jack's breast. "Not quite," replied Jack, threw back, instantly recovered, lunging _tierce_, sent his weapon left shoulder nobleman. Maltravers staggered; he leant upon his sword, snapped half, he sunk upon his knees, his face convulsed pain. "That ends it," exclaimed captain. "I confess satisfied." "No! No!" cried his lordship, seizing pointed end his rapier binding kerchief round broken part hold securely. "Surely, fight more?" "I fight till I drop." Harkaway broke his sword half his knee grasped narrow end, manner his adversary. "I willing," he replied. "My dear fellow," remonstrated Harvey, "are insane?" "By means," calm confident reply. "I come play, besides, I hate leave work half finished." "Eh! wretch," said Maltravers, bursting rage, "he mocks me; shall see." Jack sunk his knees front Maltravers, near, eyes returned flash flash hot breath fanned other's face. Maltravers bleeding profusely, his blood dropping thirsty sand, greedily sucked ruby fluid, ghastly pallor his face deepened. In minutes he succeeded inflicting scratches upon his adversary he grated his teeth grim satisfaction. This irritated Jack, precipitated matters, receiving point his lordship's weapon his left arm throwing upon him, piercing his breast bearing ground. Now Maltravers could utter protest, he fainted extended ground attitude corpse. Jack hurriedly put his coat. He bleeding, excitement moment felt inconvenience, till his wound stiffened he knew he hurt. They began leave spot. "Look here," said captain, "this contrary precedent. I recollect I fought major Twenty-seventh, left dead, sent coach doctor." "All right," responded Harvey, "we you." He departed hastily Harkaway, captain dragged insensible body Maltravers spot inland, rapidly advancing waves could touch it. For next hour he busied stanching blood, indeed way saving defeated man's life. At expiration time he perceived carriage driving furiously along sand. When reached spot captain standing gentleman stepped out. "I doctor," he said. Captain Cannon nodded, brief examination medical man ordered Maltravers driven hotel. For hours he hovered life death. The captain remained constant attendance bedside, severe attack fever supervened, professional nurse hired. On third day crisis came. It midnight doctor left sick man's room sought captain. "Has gentleman friends?" he inquired. "Yes, England," reply. "It best send without delay." "Is case grave that?" "I cannot answer result," replied doctor. Captain Cannon telegraphed Lady Maltravers, mother sick man. That night patient feverish restless; he recognized one. In afternoon following day Lady Maltravers arrived hotel accompanied Bambino, his lordship's Italian servant. This fellow villainous countenance said he condemned galleys term years, expiation terrible crime. "My son! Where son?" demanded Lady Maltravers. She conducted his room time forth watched mother's devotion. CHAPTER III. THE ASSASSIN AT WORK. Thanks his youth, aided, strong vigorous constitution, Lord Maltravers passed valley shadow death without succumbing fell destroyer. In fortnight he danger. The doctor predicted his recovery would slow, advised he remain he his strength fully established. Lady Maltravers returned London, rejoicing her child saved her, his faults she loved strong intensity fond over-indulgent mother. Consequently his lordship remained Calais charge his faithful valet, Bambino. One day, sitting first time, his pale haggard face brought prominence rays sun streamed open window, he received letter Simpkins, he written news. In letter he informed Harkaway four friends depart New York days board steamer Erin, Miss Van Hoosen preceded week. "Bambino," exclaimed his lordship. "Signor," replied valet, glided softly his side, noiseless motion black snake. "Three years ago, I Florence, man named Bambino tried commission double murder. He killed woman he marry man he jealous. The trial excited great interest; finally, found guilty, Bambino condemned galleys term his natural life." The Italian raised his hand deprecatingly. "That past, master," he said. "True; necessary I recall it. I took interest you, visiting prison transportation coast begin life-long slavery. I wanted man yourself." "You ever found grateful, signor." "Do not interrupt me. You swore faith I procured release, life mine dispose of, I thought fit. By expending large sums bribing jailers, I contrived escape, since lived life comparative ease luxury." "It true," exclaimed Bambino. "The time arrived I want exercise peculiar talents behalf." "You command, lord," replied Italian. "It obey." "Good. You seen Mr. Harkaway?" "I know well." "Again, good," exclaimed Maltravers, whose dark eyes flashed vindictively. "Harkaway enemy!" "He shall die," said Bambino, solemnly. "Very well. It see that. I position see now, man. He starts New York Saturday steamer Erin, following lady I love, he intends steal marry, I stop him. You embark vessel, time I well enough join New York, rendered good account him." "His spirit shall gone land shades. I, Bambino, swear it," said Italian. "I rely you. Is requisite say anything more?" "Nothing, lord." "Then take money want off," returned Lord Maltravers. That night Bambino his way Liverpool, port steamer started. CHAPTER IV. ADÉLE. Lord Maltravers reading book door opened beautiful girl long silky dark hair entered room. Her face sad, traces tears her pale cheeks. Springing forward, she threw herself her knees him, seizing his hand, she covered kisses, exclaimed, pathetic tones, "Oh! Arthur, last I found you." "Adéle!" he said, hectic flush mantled his cheek. "Yes," she replied. "It Adéle, little girl vowed love; Adéle married two years ago little French village _Pas de Calais_. Oh, Arthur! could desert me?" "I--I never married you," he answered, stammering little. "Indeed did." "It mock marriage." "The good _curé_ united us alive. He bear evidence I wife. I, Adéle Bellefontaine, reality Lady Maltravers." "It false." "Oh! repudiate me, for, darling, I love you," she pleaded. "If forgotten me, I never forget you." "How find out?" "I read account duel papers; said ill suffering; I walked fifty miles come nurse you, I poor ride." "You shall money go home again, foolish girl," said Maltravers. "I want it. All I ask love," replied Adéle. "Let sweet privilege waiting upon you, Arthur. I servant, slave. Do not, heaven's sake, drive you." Maltravers ill ease could disguise his agitation. Two years before, poor girl truly said, he met her secluded village, he fishing. He married poor peasant girl basely deserted her. Some letters he left behind revealed his true name, first chance Adéle come him, beg love she pining. It impossible acknowledge her claim recognize her his friends, moment he know do. His mind, however, soon made up; he would threaten her, deny her story, drive her him. "Rise," he exclaimed; "you impudent impostor. If instantly quit room I arrested. It correctional tribunal deal creatures you." Adéle rose her feet clasped her head her hands her throbbing brain would burst. Could she believe evidence her senses? "My God!" she cried. "He sends away! Does he know I heart break? Are man's vows traced upon sand written water he tells woman he loves her?" "Go," continued Maltravers, sternly. For minute she completely overwhelmed stood like one dream. "Yes, I go," she said choked voice. "Heaven knows whither! The folks village shall never see again, know shame. I said I would go husband bring back. My father mother prepare _fête_. That over. I gathering Dead Sea fruit. It turned dust hand. I trusted bad man punishment I bear. Yet, water near, one refuge weary heart-broken. Farewell, Arthur. May God forgive you, Adéle." Not muscle Maltravers's face moved. He stared coldly poor girl he wronged infamously aristocratic sneer his well-cut lip. She staggered rather walked door. She descended stairs like one dazed. The iron entered her soul, hearts seared burning hand misfortune alone sympathize her. Adéle gained street. Mechanically she sought harbor entered upon broad pathway long pier. There wild desperation her eyes; her face lighted half-insane gleam; tears came her relief. At times choking sob broke her throat--this evidence feeling she gave vent to. A drizzling rain falling kept away usual promenaders pier. The tide flood several vessels sailing harbor. She paid attention anything, seeming absorbed her misery. Her eyes became fixed glassy. Occasionally she moaned pain, pressed her hand her side still beating her heart. When end pier reached, she stopped, raised her eyes heaven her lips moved silent prayer. Then she sprung lightly parapet fell foaming sea, whose waves beating clouds spray wooden supports pier. A large merchantman passing harbor time sails set, rash act poor suicide witnessed sailors deck. Without moment's hesitation one gallant fellow jumped overboard swam toward drowning girl. He succeeded reaching her she sink, held her up, boat his ship came her rescue. Adéle her brave preserver picked conveyed vessel, she dead faint. "Holy Virgin!" exclaimed sailor, his eyes fell closely upon girl's features. "It Adéle Bellefontaine, village St. Ange, sure name Jacques Belot she girl I ever loved, she married scoundrelly Englishman, deserted her. If Adéle, here, I never gone sea." "What her?" asked captain. "The wind tide us bad luck put back." "Take her us, captain," said Jacques, fine, handsome young sailor. "It bad luck would-be suicide board," remarked boatswain. "Ah! bah! old croaker," replied Jacques. "How know girl intended kill herself?" "I saw her deliberately jump sea." "And I saw her blown side pier, wind." The sailors laughed sally, encouraged Jacques. "Will not take her New York, captain?" he continued. "Yes," replied captain, good-naturedly, "I suppose I may well. She companion wife. Carry her below, friend Jacques, mind do not get dazzled girl's pretty eyes, neglect duty. Take her away." "Ay, ay, sir," answered Jacques, raised Adéle's slender form his arms transported her captain's cabin. The skipper's wife glad companion proceeded restore her consciousness, Jacques related affair. When Adéle opened her eyes she looked wildly around her murmured: "Is death?" "No, deary," replied captain's wife, "this life. You saved Jacques here." "Oh! let die." "What for, child? You young pretty. Life charms you." "I seen he drove him. He says I claim threatened police. Oh! broken heart." She burst paroxysm bitter tears, relieved overcharged fountains her soul. "It her good," exclaimed her kind protectress. Jacques Belot gnashed his teeth. "She said 'he' she seen him," he muttered. "I know means well enough. That vile Englishman gone back her. I seen him, I recall his face like book. He lord, say; his name Maltravers. You see I forget nothing. We shall meet one day, seems little account square Mr. Englishman--_sacré-e-e_!" Presently Adéle recognized Jacques, greeted old friend, former lover. To captain's wife she related her story, gaining much sympathy them. "Forget milor'," said captain's wife. "Impossible," rejoined Adéle. "He unworthy you. Go America marry brave fellow loves saved life." Adéle shook her head sadly. "Madame," she replied, "though I deserted, I cannot fail recollect I legal wife Lord Maltravers." "At least promise attempt commit suicide." "I promise." With obliged content good ship _Notre Dame de Calais_ sailed along English Channel storms broad Atlantic. CHAPTER V. THE VOYAGE. Some days afterward ocean steamship Erin started Liverpool, board, among others, Jack Harkaway his friends, Signor Bambino, Italian gentleman, stated he proceeding New York business commercial nature. Jack Harvey took interest whatever absurd question buffalo, agitated quidnuncs Travelers' Club. The reason Jack going New York simple enough; he wanted Miss Van Hoosen was; Harvey went his friend Jack did. After first sensations inseparable sea-voyage overcome, saloon passengers began fraternize, among popular smoking-room Signor Bambino. Four days leaving Liverpool, Erin encountered severe weather; decks swept sea fore aft, six hours hatches battened down. When storm ceased, passengers came deck enjoyed calm evening. Jack Bambino played eucher midnight, Italian threw cards. "I enough it, you," he exclaimed. "But lost heavily," said Jack. "Bah! that? to-day lose, to-morrow win. It trifle, all." "As please," replied Jack. "Let us take stroll deck," continued Italian. "With heart." They quitted saloon went deck, quick eye Bambino saw deserted. A thick mist arisen, though captain bridge his form could distinguished. The phosphorescent pathway wake big ship gleamed scintillated. "How beautiful," remarked Jack. "Yes," replied Bambino. "It looks like sea fire. One might walk it." "I like try," Jack said, laughing. "Suppose make effort." At words Bambino, Jack turned half round sharply, faced squarely. "What mean?" he demanded. "Precisely I say," rejoined Bambino. They standing stern ship, right behind wheel-house. "Who you, want me?" inquired Jack, became suspicious. "I fancy throw sea." "Madman!" "Yes, like. I peculiar times. Come! like look this?" As he spoke, Bambino drew long knife made thrust Harkaway. The latter stepped back quickly, receiving point knife fleshy part his right arm. It merely graze serious inconvenience, served put his guard. Being unarmed himself, he concluded his best course would grapple his assailant, he accordingly did, dashing knife his grasp lucky hit placing equality cowardly assassin. The struggle ensued short, sharp decisive, superior strength robust Englishman soon told effeminate Italian, who, deprived his knife, dangerous. Jack threw deck pinned throat. "Villain," he cried, "what object attacking me?" Bambino made answer. "Tell me," continued Jack, "or I will strangle life you!" He compressed his fingers mere tightly assassin's eyes started sockets, his face assumed purple hue. "Speak, speak!" persisted Jack. A gurgling sound came man's mouth, he made signs he stifled. When gripe slightly relaxed he said: "I poor adventurer, fancied I could get money robbing you." "That truth; robbery object, murder." "Well, I confess," exclaimed Bambino, afraid killed thought he could serve his employer better alive dead. "Make haste." "Lord Maltravers ordered kill you. I simply hired assassin. Let live." All instantly clear Jack. "I satisfied," he replied. "You let go, now?" "Indeed, I nothing kind. I must make prisoner protection, reach New York authorities decide done you." It vain Bambino protest; he submitted his fate sullen silence, allowing dragged amidship, Jack explained first officer happened. The watch called, would-be murderer, gnashing his teeth failure his attempt, taken confined. The next morning Jack appeared breakfast saloon nothing happened, he told Mr. Mole Harvey emissary Lord Maltravers attempted his life. "This important," observed professor. "It shows lengths Maltravers go remove his path. Let man's full confession taken; he used means arrest his lordship, who, I right law, sent prison, fellow's accomplice." "Certainly, he can," replied Harvey. "It pleasant," remarked Jack, "to know enemy plotting far-off country sending men kill you." "I idea," said Mole. "Something novel you, sir." "Oh! no. This old head prolific time. Let us form Jack Harkaway guard." "Splendid idea," cried Harvey. "I volunteer service. You I arm one us him, night day." "No, no," said Jack, much touched proof devotion his friends, "it unnecessary." "On contrary," answered Mole, "I sure attempt followed others." "Well! If insist upon it--" "We do," said professor Harvey chorus. Jack shook hands token gratitude, Mr. Mole brought small arsenal pistols knives his trunk, use emergency, he promptly armed Harvey. Meanwhile Jack remained deck. Suddenly man look-out reported sail leeward. The steamer altered her course made directly vessel, she showed signals distress appeared water-logged condition. When near enough captain ordered engines stopped boat lowered. This done crew manned boat row distressed craft. An event like relieved monotony sea voyage deck soon crowded passengers. In half hour crew rowed vessel returned without boarding her. They reported ship leaking badly abandoned her crew, suffering severely late storm. Her masts gone side; her sails blown rags; her bulwarks stove in. She rudderless wonder she kept afloat. When reported boat hauled davits more, captain steamer ordered engineer go ahead, proceeded his course. He felt he done humanity required him. Scarcely dull, heavy beat enormous engines made heard vibrating ship commotion seen forecastle. Jack ran forward ascertain because. A man seen struggling fiercely sailors, trying detain him. It Bambino. By means, steamer lying to, he contrived escape place he confined. "Stop him!" cried Jack. "Knock down, he dangerous." Bambino, however, much his opponents, dashing one side, made flying leap sprung side sea. Whether he dived like duck sucked ship struck one flanges screw, difficult tell. He looked directions. The steamer stopped boat lowered, nothing could seen man overboard. "He gone his last account," said captain, "and he loss." "I would rather live," replied Jack, remark addressed, "and somehow, I cannot quite make mind fellow born drowned." "Hanging certainly his line." "That so," said Jack. The steamer proceeded her way, Jack amused scanning expanse ocean, opera-glass. He fancied he saw dark object resembling man struggling waves vicinity abandoned vessel. It quickly left behind, thinking might his imagination, he dismissed Bambino his mind. CHAPTER VI. THE ABANDONED SHIP. The crafty Italian, however; easily disposed of. He perfectly home water, had, diving, kept concealed view, his intention swim toward abandoned vessel, he seen soon he came deck. He knew long term imprisonment awaited him, he taken New York, he deemed risk, matter desperate, preferable fate. This decided jumping overboard. In time, he succeeded reaching water-logged ship, rolled uneasily upon heaving bosom deep. Climbing chains, he got board found sole master fine vessel. She partly laden timber, accounted her keeping afloat, disabled condition she was. His first task examine her cabins, free water. In forecastle he found everything disorder, vessel abandoned hurry without sufficient because. Probably ship overwhelmed fury storm dead night, crew, seized panic, lowered boats. Her figure-head washed away name her stern decipherable. Bambino could make letters, "v--r--e--a--n--d--ris." Going aft, he descended companion-ladder, entered captain's cabin, indications haste noticeable forecastle. Everything thrown reckless confusion, many articles value piled up, carried away. In various lockers he found provisions plenty, unharmed saltwater. Cans meats, sardines, biscuits fruits, well bottles wine, brandy beer. His spirits rose timely discovery, his elation increased he reflected ship would keep afloat time, unless engulfed another storm, indication present. Sitting down, he placed table cabin excellent repast, he partook good appetite, washing copious draughts wine. His satisfaction culminated he found box fine cigars, he promptly began smoke, box matches affording light he wanted. While he congratulating upon his good luck, he heard peculiar sound. This came appeared inner cabin, door locked. The sound resembled moaning human deep anguish. Somewhat superstitious, Bambino crossed muttered prayer. Again sound repeated. Bambino's hair began erect itself, he advanced partition, inclining his head listening position. CHAPTER VII. THE MYSTERY OF THE DESERTED VESSEL. After listening partition time Bambino became convinced human confined inner cabin. Frequently he heard sobs groans mingled exclamations French language, he well acquainted. A examination showed door, several pieces furniture jammed, evidently thrown progress storm. This effectually prevented egress unfortunate person inside. Being powerful man, Italian exerted utmost succeeded removing bureau, chairs heavy table piled confusion. Then door flew open, he beheld lady lying bed, easily observable she state complete exhaustion, many days without food. Had help come did, she could survived much longer. Though face beautiful, cheeks sunken, emaciated hollow; her long silken hair hung disheveled masses her shoulders, her deeply expressive eyes glare incipient insanity. No sooner girl see Bambino she endeavored rise, compelled fall back weakness. "Who you?" he asked, tenderly. "I angel now," she replied. "Death held his arms. I suffer more, though hard bitter die." Her voice faint feeble. There her words manner indicated her mind wandering. Reason tottered throne, finally given way beneath weight her sufferings. Seeing she want nourishment, he procured food he administered spoon, afterward compelling her drink wine. Toward night she improved considerably, fell refreshing sleep. Bambino went repeatedly deck look sail, see one. His position precarious one, another storm arise, little doubt vessel would either capsize break her back. He drew consolation fact he path steamships constantly crossing recrossing Atlantic ocean. Two days passed, lady remained comatose state; but, he continued feed her intervals, she gradually regained her strength, third day able get converse. Her mind, however, gone. She talked incoherently, persisting she died storm, she spirit. "When I alive," she would say, "I lived France I married English nobleman. When he dies comes land spirits, he deny I his wife, though earth, he drove broke heart." "What his name?" asked Bambino, became interested her random utterings, he scarcely knew why. "Lord Maltravers; see I remember that, though I cannot recollect things happened I died. I called Adéle." Bambino started visibly changed color. He heard his master speak girl, appeared he made important discovery. Maltravers admitted confidential villain he legally married girl, he hoped she dead, she might give trouble she lived. Slave he was, bound hand foot his titled master, Bambino felt that, girl his possession, he would powerful weapon use, he ever come open conflict him. He determined say she his sister captain crew ship left behind hurry quit, he could easily add Adéle become crazed terror. A week went by; though Adéle grew stronger, amelioration her mental condition. She quiet even childish. Never she utter threats Lord Maltravers. She loved sweet, innocent way affecting. In locket, she wore around her neck, she faded photograph handsome, bad man, made her plaything idle hour ruined her young life. This she would take her bosom she concealed kiss greatest rapture, pressing her lips murmuring words purest affection despairing love. It sight make hardest heart feel, bring tears eyes callous man world. Even Bambino, wretch he was, known love, he sighed her misery. At length wished-for sail hove sight, Italian contrived attract attention crew, lowered boat come rescue. He went roused Adéle, bending photograph loved one, much little child plays pretty toy. "Come, _mio caro_," he exclaimed, "we going board another ship, take us great city. Put thing away." Adéle held picture, smile overspread her countenance. "Is not he lovely?" she asked. Bambino set his lips firmly together, dark eyes--peculiar Latin race--flashed forth fire. "I cannot say anything him," he replied, "for I owe much; but, _cospetto_! he go different places die." "I dead. You know that," said simple-minded girl. "But he come time ask pardon? Will he fold his arms old call his darling?" "Possibly." "Oh, yes," said she, her eyes rolled ecstasy unbounded affection. "It must so. There _must_ recompense pure heart, hereafter." Bambino touched. He patted her beautiful hair air affectionate brother. "Would God, child," he said, "that I love instead woman's who--but matter; hand red her blood." Adéle looked dread surprise. "Did kill her?" she asked. Bambino laughed, harsh, metallic tone. "She dead," he replied. "Ay, and--_Corpo di Baccho_! man grave, too." "Man! man?" inquired Adéle. "Ask questions, unless want madden me," cried Bambino. "I thought wound cicatrized, you, childish questions, set blood fire. I loved woman." "Maltravers loved once, yet I kill he deserted afterward drove him, I laid heart his feet. How kill love?" Bambino could say more. He led Adéle gently firmly companion-ladder, minutes boat steamer alongside. They taken ship. He told his story excited much sympathy, especially he reached vessel, bound New York. Adéle he given berths intermediate part ship, amidships, five days found New York. Bambino careful conceal his right name, he knew log would published papers, might reach Harkaway's eye. The Italian resolved keep Adéle his charge, counterfoil ill-treatment he might receive Lord Maltravers. When steamer arrived, he went hotel secured attendance Adéle, cast place he could place her. In paper he saw advertisement effect: "ASTROLOGY.--Madame Vesta Levine, real fortune-teller city--electric baths--galvanism. Boarders taken. W. 32d St." The morning his arrival he called upon Mme. Levine, middle-aged lady, intellectual face. She look like charlatan, exhibited diploma medical college, proved she knowledge healing art. He received her office, contained chairs, table books shelf, skulls, stuffed snakes ordinary stock trade fortune-teller. "What I you, sir?" she demanded. "I sister," replied Bambino, "whose mind affected disappointment love subsequent shipwreck sea. She young. I wish put her asylum. I great faith electricity I place her care, paying three months' board advance, receive her." "I shall glad take her patient," answered Mme. Levine. "You try cure her?" "Undoubtedly." "I must warn she imagines she departed spirit." Mme. Levine smiled. "That nothing," she answered. "I worse cases that. When shall I expect sister, sir?" Bambino promised bring her round evening, took his departure. Later day he made his reappearance Adéle, evinced attachment seemed care alone. For hours she would talk herself occasionally press her hands her head, hurt her. Mme. Vesta Levine room top her house prepared her detailed colored woman wait upon her. "Beware," said Bambino he left house, "how treat sister. I shall demand strict account you." The madame smiled scornfully, she glanced swarthy Italian fair-haired daughter France, she knew one instant related. "Sir," she replied, "your 'sister' perfectly safe hands, require her I shall perfectly ready deliver her." Bowing politely Italian took his leave, feeling Adéle good hands, he could find her whenever he wanted her. While returning hotel he staying, he beheld two gentlemen walking together Broadway. No sooner he seen he drew his breath quickly drawing his hat his brows, darted doorway allow pass, without perceiving him. It Jack Harkaway his friend Harvey. "We must hurry," exclaimed Jack, "or shall late Miss Van Hoosen's reception, know heart longs see girl more." Harvey laughed lightly. "It seems me," he replied, "that much smitten quarter." "I do not mind acknowledging it," said Jack. "She sweetest, prettiest, charming young lady I ever met travels." "So she is," answered Harvey. "She worthy her." "If superlative attraction she I now." "Well! You congratulate one thing." "What that?" "You cut Lord Maltravers game entirely. He show now. Ha! Ha!" laughed Harvey. "Ha! ha!" laughed Jack. "You right there, fellow dangerous." "Yes, indeed." "Fancy his sending fellow assassinate me. It lucky I got best him." "Between fishes Atlantic cannot much left villain," remarked Harvey. This conversation distinctly audible Bambino, two young men paused light cigars. "We shall see!" muttered crafty Italian. "Let laugh win." At moment elderly gentleman, passing dim light evening, drew his pocket-handkerchief; and, so, large wallet fell sidewalk. He notice his loss. Bambino, however, saw it, sudden idea came his head, upon he hesitate act. Starting rapidly forward, he picked wallet, pushing Jack, dropped pocket his overcoat. "Here, you, sir!" exclaimed Jack. "Where coming to?" "Beg pardon," answered Bambino, gruff voice. "Do not again, that is all," rejoined Jack. "There lots room us." Bambino retired quickly he came, walked elderly gentleman lost wallet. "Sir," he exclaimed, touching shoulder. This man merchant connected Produce Exchange, wealthy, mean. "I have nothing you," replied Mr. Cobb, his name. "I want speak you." "Not to-night, good fellow. I cannot give anything tramps beggars." "Listen moment," persisted Bambino. "Have lost anything?" Instantly Mr. Cobb's hands dived his pockets, look alarm stole his face. "Why, bless me, yes, wallet!" he said. "Have seen it?" "Did contain anything valuable?" "I say did. Valuable! What is man talking about? Where it? Tell once, I will call police arrested." Bambino pointed Harkaway, yards ahead. "Do see person?" he asked. "Which one--there two together?" "The stout one. It he I saw take wallet pocket." "Then he thief?" "Precisely," replied Bambino. "Good-evening. I hope recover property." Lifting his hat politely, he turned side street, leaving Mr. Cobb go his money. Harkaway perfectly unconscious trick played upon him. As Harvey, he little uneasy. "Jack," he said, "did notice face fellow pushed you?" "Not distinctly; why?" replied Jack. "I did, features reminded Italian scoundrel talking." "Bambino?" "Yes. The hired assassin sworn enemy, Lord Maltravers." "Absurd!" exclaimed Jack. "The fellow perished sea. We know well." "Never mind; face haunts me." "You should not indulge silly fancies, Dick. I tell rascal dead doornail," replied Jack. Just then, Mr. Cobb rushed seized Harkaway rudely arm. "Hello!" exclaimed Jack. "What is matter you? Has every one got mania jostling to-night?" "My wallet, wallet!" cried Mr. Cobb. Jack shook his grasp drawing proudly looked sternly face. "My good sir," he said, "be kind enough explain yourself." "You stolen wallet. I saw it." This stretch imagination part produce merchant, he relied Bambino told him. "Do I look like a--a thief?" inquired Jack, knowing whether get angry not, feeling inclined regard Mr. Cobb harmless lunatic. "No," admitted merchant, "but gentlemanly thieves dangerous." Jack turned inquiringly Harvey. "Dick," he exclaimed, "ought I knock man down?" "Under circumstances, would justified," replied Harvey. "But, dear boy, he old respect old age." "True. Pass on, sir, presume annoy ridiculous charges," said Jack. "My money. I want money, robber. You shall escape thus," persisted Mr. Cobb. Again he laid his hand Jack, time flung violently window store. A small crowd idlers began collect, attention one Broadway squad arrested. "What is this?" asked officer, coming up. "Arrest man," cried Mr. Cobb. "What for?" "Robbery. I charge stolen wallet, containing large sum." "Who you?" "Richard Cobb, firm Cobb Co. Every one knows South street." The officer seized Jack elbow. "I arrest you," he said. "Come along." "Allow explain," exclaimed Jack. "You station." Jack shrugged his shoulders. "This queer country," he replied; "yet I make rule never resist constituted authority." "You would not find much use did," answered officer, swinging his locust club. Harvey much annoyed. "Let assure you, policeman," he said, "that made mistake." "Cannot help it," stolid reply. "This friend, Mr. Harkaway, England. We stopping Fifth avenue Hotel." "I guess pair stop somewheres else to-night," answered policeman, smiling his joke. It useless argue point, officer conducted his prisoners station, Mr. Cobb made his charge. Jack indignantly denied accusation, demanded searched. Imagine his dismay, searchers produced missing wallet pocket his overcoat. "That is mine!" cried Mr. Cobb, exultantly. "What I tell you?" "Lock  them up," said captain. "I send British Consul," exclaimed Jack. "This infamous plot." "Bambino," muttered Harvey. "Right, Dick; eyes better mine. I ought known fellow never born drowned," replied Jack. "Put different cells," continued captain. They conducted locked up, feeling indignant, unable help themselves. The charge looked grave them, Harvey much implicated Jack, he regarded accomplice. Mr. Cobb promised appear morning, went home. As he left station he perceive man hiding shadow house. This Bambino, watched arrest, finding game securely bagged, turned away chuckle. "Five years State's prison highway robbery," he muttered, "will please his lordship." Repairing telegraph office, he sent following dispatch cable Maltravers: "Come soon can. The coast clear. The lady yours, Jack likely cross path time come. "BAMBINO." CHAPTER VIII. A LOVERS' QUARREL. Professor Mole much surprised failure Jack Harvey return hotel, he still astonished, midnight he received note informing arrest false charge robbery. He proceeded station interview them, afterward procured bail person proprietor hotel. The next thing see Mr. Cobb, who, his money recovered, happier frame mind, satisfied Harkaway's respectability, consented withdraw charge. How money got Jack's pocket easy explain, affair remained mystery. It unfortunately necessary Harkaway appear court, Mr. Cobb's application he discharged. The case, however, reported papers; Jack, his mortification, read paragraph entitled: "SINGULAR CHARGE AGAINST AN ENGLISH GENTLEMAN. "Mr. Jack Harkaway Mr. Richard Harvey, two English gentlemen means respectability, residing Brevoort House, charged Jefferson Market police court stealing wallet containing three thousand dollars cash securities, person Mr. Cobb, well-known member Produce Exchange. The money found Mr. Harkaway, Mr. Cobb, feeling assured mistake somewhere, refused prosecute withdrew charge, whereupon prisoners discharged." This intensely annoying Jack, stabbed his reputation cast slur upon his honor. There possibility explaining matter, he felt his character blackened, though his friends attach importance occurrence he did. The villain, Bambino, succeeded his purpose, put Jack way prison, make coast clear his noble employer. Yet he inflicted wound sensitive mind, he chuckled inwardly chagrin he knew Harkaway must suffer. With cat-like stealth he watched waited opportunity deal another blow. The effect publication referred soon apparent. Jack determined show everywhere, he thought hide would tacitly admit he guilty felt ashamed. Consequently he drove nearly every day. Mr. Mole, Captain Cannon Mr. Twinkle occupied searching New York vicinity buffalo; but, much disappointment, could find any. The professor prepared elaborate report club sent expedition, he stated: "After prolonged investigation, I inclined think buffalo, like mastodon dodo, extinct animal, I discover trace living buffalo far, though I hopes visit Long Island, I told wild savage, may meet specimen almost mythical beast." There going steeple-chase Jerome Park, Jack sent Miss Van Hoosen invitation ride grounds. This led first severe mortification he received, report papers, Lena refused following brief note: "MISS VAN HOOSEN presents her compliments Mr. Harkaway, begs thank his invitation, she reluctantly compelled decline." On receiving this, Jack showed Harvey. "Look that, Dick," he exclaimed, "and tell meaning it." Harvey read it, replied, "It laconic enough, means, simply, lady go." "What would do, circumstances?" "Call upon her explanation." "I should not surprised, she seen paragraph Mr. Cobb's money." "More likely." Jack bit his lips vexation his face reddened. Without losing time he visited Lena, shown reception-room. Presently Lena entered, looking usually sweet charming. There slight embarrassment her manner, she held her hand requested seated. "I sorry cannot come us," he said. "So I," she replied. "But I glad opportunity explaining. There gentleman acquaintance I esteem I you." Jack bowed politely, felt he could laid his life her, saying words. "My brother," she continued, "has read something journal, he says I ought receive visits. I feel must mistake. If could see brother explain--" A tall gentleman, years older Jack, entered room moment. "No explanation necessary," he exclaimed. Jack flushed indignantly. "I presume," he said, "I honor addressing Mr. Alfred Van Hoosen?" "That name," replied new-comer, stiffly. "And brother lady?" "Precisely, sir." "In case, relationship prevents taking notice words I otherwise should." "Oh, sir," said Alfred Van Hoosen, he smiled sarcastically, "pray let stand way." "I simply desirous assuring sister absolutely foundation report she alluded." "The case speaks itself." "Am I understand consider proper person visit house?" "That I intended convey you, I thank saving trouble expressing myself." Jack turned Lena, regarding her almost imploring glance. "Do concur brother's opinion?" he asked. She would trust herself speak, inclined her head. Burning mortification, Jack quitted house despair his heart, seemed Lena lost forever. In order regain her good-will would necessary satisfy her brother, he would listen explanation, course seemed impossible. For time he inconsolable, he determined go race same, hoping he might least see Lena there. It lovely day, wealth fashion New York hastening toward Park. On Eighth avenue passed open carriage, seated Miss Van Hoosen her mother. In spite his dismissal day before, Jack ventured raise his hat, Lena bow, though he fancied her eyes appeared seek his. "Fine girl that," remarked gentleman sat Jack. "You appear know her." "Yes," replied Jack, "I met Paris--that is--her mother herself." "Fine family. Best New York. Regular Knickerbocker stock. Are acquainted her brother?" "I met him," said Jack little confused. "He rides to-day." "Indeed! I aware that." "Yes, he mounts horse called Warrior. The knowing ones betting two one him, I heard say Union Club last night, he he would give cup his sister." Jack uncharitable disposition, another he hoped Alfred Van Hoosen would win. At length course reached, Jack took walk starting-place look horses. He excellent cross-country rider himself, he loved horse dearly. All he saw gentleman drive one stables, alight hurriedly his buggy. In he slipped step fell heavily ground. A cry pain escaped him. "Confound it," he exclaimed. "I have sprained ankle." It Alfred Van Hoosen. Leaning arm his trainer, hurried offer his support, he entered stable. Jack lingered around spot see result accident would be, appeared Mr. Van Hoosen would unable ride his horse day. While he waiting, Harvey met said excitedly: "I looking you." "Anything happened?" asked Jack. "Oh! no, I want upon guard." "What for?" "Near grand stand, I saw Italian ruffian Bambino, Lord Maltravers hired kill you." Jack smiled incredulously. "My dear fellow," he replied, "it evident got Bambino brain." "I trust eyes, I suppose," answered Harvey, little petulantly. "Not case. You seen man resembles Bambino, all." "And I distinctly assert assassin himself." "Bosh!" "All right. A willful man must his way," said Harvey, shrugging his shoulders. "I like argue point you, confirmed skeptic, I fear I wasting time." "Oh, no, I open conviction," Harkaway rejoined. "Well, now, possible assassin jumped overboard he might gained abandoned vessel?" "Possible, probable." "Granting fact his gained it, could he taken brought New York?" "Ah!" said Jack, drawing deep breath. "What think now?" "I begin believe Bambino." "Shake hands that. I think I begin see money Mr. Cobb came pocket; attempt blast reputation. Having failed kill you, he stabs character wounds tenderest susceptible part. Here another point--Lord Maltravers, scoundrel's master, rival affections Miss Van Hoosen." "Undoubtedly!" "Well, call refused house, simply account alleged robbery. What calculated please Maltravers!" "True. I willing admit, Dick, genius, I guard, suggest," said Jack. The course crowded people carriages. It brilliant gathering year, still people came. A bell rung give notice start steeple-chase made. There dozen entries; horses ridden owners, professional jockeys. The horses riders began show track, took preliminary canters, exciting admiration criticism spectators. Presently, trainer Warrior came stable, looking much disconcerted. He approached two men standing near Harkaway, conversation ensued distinctly audible. "Is boss much hurt?" asked one. "Yes, his foot swelled I cut his boot off. He is lying bale hay, great pain." "Then he will not ride Warrior to-day?" "He cannot." "What going it?" asked man. "He wants take mount pay well. He knows good rider." "I am going risk breaking neck, riding beast temper Warrior," replied man. "You are fool." "Maybe so, estimation, I am tired life yet. Why, I would cross brute's back flat race, let alone steeple-chase. Mr. Van Hoosen one manage him, perhaps he would come grief first steep fence." "Then shall withdraw him," said trainer sadly. "That is do." "It is pity, I thought he would win _sure_, I bet money I care lose." Impelled irresistible motive, filled dare-devil spirit, he could keep times, Harkaway touched trainer shoulder. "Do want one ride horse?" he demanded. "Yes, sir." "I will it." The trainer eyed curiously, result his inspection appeared satisfactory. "How much want it?" he inquired. "Nothing all. I gentleman, fun thing." "Beg pardon, sir," replied trainer touching his hat respectfully. "Get colors, bring stable, I will soon saddle." "Will not come inside see Mr. Van Hoosen, sir?" "It necessary. I--I do not care disturb him. Besides, time lost. There goes bell clear course, again, horses paddock." "Who shall I tell master riding horse, sir?" "Say Mr. Smith," replied Jack, wished keep his identity concealed Mr. Van Hoosen. The trainer led way stables; jockey's dress brought put on; Warrior led out. He powerful horse, well-bred every respect magnificent animal. He threw his ears back kicked viciously show his temper. "What going do, Jack?" asked Harvey. "Ride beauty," reply. "He is lamb, I am judge. Look his ugly eye." Jack patted Warrior's neck, saying, "Soho! lad. Steady!" When he sprung saddle, grasped reins firmly received whip trainer. "Be careful use spur, sir," exclaimed latter. Jack nodded carelessly. "Go put money on, Dick," he said. "I mean win race break horse's heart neck, show certain young lady her brother I do." Touching Warrior lightly his whip, he cantered toward inclosure, horses already assembled. The Van Hoosen colors were, black cap white shirt large black bands. If pretty, least conspicuous calculated attract attention. CHAPTER IX. THE RACE. Going course, Jack gave Warrior canter see he made of, found fast goer, well his weight, inclined restive his way. In front grand stand, thronged elegantly-dressed ladies gentlemen, Jack stopped short canter took look sea faces. In front row Miss Van Hoosen her mother. They evidently heard nothing Alfred's accident, recognized horse colors, appeared much astonished. Jack could resist temptation bowing Lena, who, quite perplexed, acknowledged his salutation slight inclination head. Then he cantered gracefully back starting-place, taking his position among riders, ready start. This effected without much trouble, time allowed Harkaway reflection. He consider he undertaken dangerous task consenting ride animal he knew nothing of, he confidence his powers, never much habit calculating consequences. "They are off! they are off!" shouted crowd, beautiful creatures dashed past, like many arrows bow. Jack perfectly satisfied Warrior wind bottom enough stay, he determined ride waiting race, feeling sure several horses would tail would fail jumps. The first jump made hurdles, Warrior took well, rising like bird going without trouble eating measure oats. Although Jack held well hand his stride told first mile, he cut crowd considerably, four horses front him. The dangerous-looking one long-barreled, long-legged black horse, powerful haunches way going meant mischief. At second jump, made branches trees represent hedge, Warrior began show his temper, he flatly refused take it. Jack put again, gave spur, digging rowels deep his flanks, he lashed whip. With snort mingled rage pain, horse rushed jump cleared it; he docile longer, he dashed away manner showed he meant his way. "Go it, beauty!" muttered Jack, "we will soon see master." Warrior backward accepting challenge, made running fine style, taking leap leap like deer. It required strong hand quick eye manage him. Jack's arms felt would pulled sockets, he kept his seat saddle he grown there. The course circular one. Two-thirds way round artificially-constructed water-jump, hole dug, twenty-five feet wide forty feet long ten deep. Owing recent rain formidable leap full water. A large crowd collected here, anticipating sport, correctly surmised many horses would either refuse throw riders. Jack course, great disadvantage him, yet he saw gleam water prepared it. The black horse leading, behind strong Kentucky bay. Both cleared water-jump successfully. Jack passed fourth horse, weakened visibly. The third horse fell water-jump, breaking his rider's collar-bone injuring shot. This accident made Jack third race. After water-leap three sets hurdles; then, mile half, straight run home, nice bit turf horse ever galloped on. Warrior approached his task Jack plied whip spur, fearful he might balk sight water, many horses will, determining get possible. Loud cheers cries encouragement greeted him. The edge water nearly reached; he prepared lift horse; breeze almost blowing words his throat, he stimulated animal his voice: "Now, then, darling," he said, "jump life mine." Suddenly man crowd opened umbrella held near Warrior's eyes. The effect instantaneous, horse swerved, refused jump, rearing up, stood moment his hind legs, pawing air. Jack afraid he would fall crush him, he equal occasion, he threw off, Warrior fell back. Before he this, he caught sight man umbrella. "Bambino," he muttered. The wretch opened umbrella, evidently purpose frighten horse make Jack endanger his life. Harvey right, all. The fall Jack received ugly one; moment he lay stunned bleeding cut forehead. He lost his cap, his shirt torn muddy. Kind sympathizing bystanders helped his feet; willing hands caught his horse. Harkaway looked dazed manner, his indomitable pluck carried trying ordeal. His head swimming he pain, he never faltered moment. Bambino disappeared. Perhaps he dreaded vengeance populace, his cowardly trick could fail noticed one. "Give up, boss," asked man helped Jack rise. "No; I will ride die," answer. He walked horse, mounted, backing his steed, quivering every limb, put jump. The bystanders delighted his courage. His phrase "ride die" seemed tickle crowd immensely. "Hurrah!" cried. "Ride die! Bravo!" "Who that?" asked one. "He wears Van Hoosen colors." "It is Jack Harkaway," replied stableman seen Jack's drag. "He is got grit him." "You bet he has." "Hurrah!" shouted crowd, again. "Ride die! Sail in! Ride die!" This time, Warrior, ashamed his former failure, made amends taking leap, velocity meteor. He landed safely side amid applause spectators, Jack gave his head. Away went, horse seeming like nothing better. The black horse far ahead, Jack expected, he husbanded his rider, his strength beginning fail him. The first set hurdles cleared; second, Warrior stumbled; vigorous hand reins sharp reminder whip, showed his duty, he went over. At third last set, second horse fell heavily, throwing his rider. Harkaway second race, leader home stretch, going somewhat labored manner. Going last fence, Jack put his horsemanship requisition. The grand stand view, hoarse roar thousands voices became audible. "Ride die!" thought Jack, "and Jove I will it." Whip spur spared, Warrior, mastered tamed, overhauled black horse half mile home. Now ensued interesting exciting part race. The Kentucky thoroughbred, ridden owner, struggled gamely; he Warrior went along neck neck. Louder louder grew roar assembled multitude. Jack knew he drawing near goal, mist came his eyes. How near he could tell. The black horse last seemed fall back, Warrior went ahead. There shout acclamation. "Black cap wins! Van Hoosen! Van Hoosen!" Jack reined his horse; trainer seized bridle, he dismounted stable-door; though he got there, he could tell. "All right now, sir. Step inside," said trainer. The mist deepening, dizziness Jack's head increasing. He could see objects indistinctly. What matter him? Could he hurt he suspected? Before gentleman sat bale hay, he seemed bandage his foot. "Mr. Smith," began gentleman. "Why! It is Jack Harkaway!--Mr. Harkaway, I mean, pardon familiarity. How deuce come ride horse, sir?" "You are Alfred Van Hoosen?" said Jack, faint voice. "Certainly, I am." "Did I win race?" "Did win it? Why, man alive! It finest race record, tell me. Every one perfectly wild it, and--" "Excuse me," interrupted Jack. "I know I ought ridden horse, I wanted sister cup, you will accept apology--" It Van Hoosen's turn interrupt Jack. "Apology! dear fellow," he said. "I do not know mean." "You did not treat well day, I know wrong ride horse." "You done greatest service one man could another," replied Van Hoosen. "When I sprained ankle, I hurt badly, I told I shall get house month least. At present I suffering terrible torture. If ridden horse, I ruined man, I do not mind telling I backed mount heavily, I stood lose I afford. It would broken heart go mother ask her pay debts honor. You saved me." Jack's face lighted faint smile. It brother girl he loved talking him. "I am awfully glad," he said. "It pleases help man bad place. If man give coat, I will go home now, send colors morning. I have got friends here--drove drag down, know, I fear I neglected them." "Sit moment," replied Van Hoosen. "You are fine fellow, Harkaway, I am sorry I said yesterday." "Do not mention it, dear fellow. I have forgotten it." "I have sent wine. Will not wait?" "Well, yes. Just moment--the fact is--I am well--I have got sudden vertigo--I--I cannot see." He extended his arms groped his way, toward door; ere he reached he fell floor, blood flowed wound his forehead. For time his senses left him. CHAPTER X. A RECONCILIATION. When Jack Harkaway came he strange room, he know make it. The apartment elegantly furnished; pictures value hung upon walls, evident he house people taste wealth. "Hello! I?" he asked. The heavy damask curtains drawn around windows, faint light penetrated bedside. Yet imperfect light Jack fancied he saw shadowy female form, exquisitely symmetrical, get lounge leave room. A bell-rope hung side bed, attracted Jack's attention, he rung violently. Raising up, he sunk unable sustain his weight. "I am frightfully weak," he murmured. "Wonder I have sick?" Presently footstep sounded stairs man opening door, entered apartment. Jack recognized Alfred Van Hoosen. "Well, boy," he exclaimed. "So come to, last?" "Have I bad?" asked Jack. "Only brain fever, that is all." "How that?" "When threw Warrior--by way, I sold fifty thousand dollars, yesterday. Thanks you." "To me?" "Yes, indeed--you made his reputation. But I going say--you struck head stone, made famous 'ride die' speech." "Is famous?" "Well, I think so. It is papers, you will called 'Ride die Jack,' long live country." "You do not say so?" replied Jack, smile satisfaction stole his countenance. He vain, he liked praised he deserved it, he knew he ridden Warrior he worth. "Where I?" he added. "In house. I took liberty bringing here," replied Alfred Van Hoosen. "Do not apologize." "Oh! I must," said Alfred, laughing. "You apologized riding horse victory, do not remember?" "Have I ill long?" "About ten days--but do not excite yourself. The doctor says you will week, keep quiet." "Thanks. I will quiet. Who nursing me?" "I liberty tell you." "Was sister? I thought I saw--" "Ask her yourself," interrupted Alfred Van Hoosen. "I must leave now, strictly orders talk you. The nurse bring beef tea minutes; good yourself." "One moment. Did get cup?" "The steeple-chase cup? Yes, indeed. It adorns family mahogany down-stairs, mother really proud it. Good-by." Alfred quitted room, Jack sunk back pillow doze, filled pleasant reflections. Soon nurse, engaged neighboring hospital, came up-stairs sat watch patient. She best temper, she disturbed supper lamenting good things she left stairs. "It is odd," she murmured, "that sick man cannot left alone hour. This one would not die jump window. That buttered toast sardines I quitted real elegant; mouth waters thought them." Scarcely words escaped her lips knock door. "Come!" she said, testily. The door opened dark-haired man swarthy complexion appeared. "Please!" he exclaimed. "I have brought medicine, drug-store, told down-stairs come it." "You are not young fellow came before," nurse said, eying critically. "No, he is friend mine, he asked come." "All right. What is directions?" "You are give gentleman white mixture right away, midnight, red." "Are doctor's orders?" "Yes, madam." "I wish you would wait here, I go finish supper; folks dinner one know." The man's dark eyes flashed. "Cospetto!" he muttered. "I would like nothing better." "What is said?" asked nurse. "Nothing, madam. I will glad stay." "What countryman you?" "Italian." "Thought foreigner. Well! stay I will give ten cents I come back. If he wakes up, call me, ringing bell." "Yes, madam." The nurse quitted room, Italian advanced bed, looking intently Harkaway. "It he," he said low tone. "I tracked his lair. Now medicine, give him? He know me. Perhaps I best wait nurse." He handled bottle, ordinary two-ounce vial, regarded affectionately. "Let swallow _this_," he added, "and he never wake more." Harkaway moved restlessly his sleep. Had he intimation Bambino near him, preparing carry another iniquitous scheme generated his fertile brain? In sober truth, give fellow his due, he served his master well. Lord Maltravers dissatisfied him. The daylight faded away dim twilight existing, made difficult discern objects. Everything looked shadowy ghostly. Bambino seen Harkaway's insensible condition he carried course he tracked Van Hoosens' house. The white mixture vial subtle poison, he gained entrance house pretending he clerk drug store. Touching Jack arm, he saw awake. "What it?" he asked, dreamily. "Your medicine," replied Bambino. "Give me, let sleep. I drowsy." "It make sleep," said Italian, grim smile. He took glass poured colorless fluid, reality death draught. Harkaway sat extended his hand it, received it, raised glass his lips. At critical moment door opened doctor attending made his appearance. "What is this?" he said. "No light? got hand? I doctor, do not know me?" "Medicine!" answered Jack, replying first question. "Eh? I do not understand," said doctor, puzzled air. "Some stuff sent me, I suppose." Bambino bent bed. "Drink," he whispered. Jack so, doctor snatched glass his hands. At time, he struck match lighted gas. "Now, let us see," he exclaimed. Weak sleepy he was, action part doctor roused Jack, whose eyes settled Italian. "Bambino!" he cried, shuddering his gaze rested black snake. The doctor removed cork bottle tasted contents tip his tongue. "Strychnine!" he ejaculated. Bambino, finding he detected his scheme frustrated, gnashed his teeth baffled rage. It high time endeavor escape, he made his way toward door. "No do not, friend," exclaimed doctor, barring his exit. Bambino, know, man unlimited resources. He drew his vest long, polished dagger scattered thousand flashes he brandished gas-light. "_Santa Maria_!" he cried. "Steel talks, signor." The doctor way disconcerted, he quickly produced pistol. "Yes, good fellow," he rejoined, "and iron dog bark." Bambino made rush upon doctor, fired, his bullet missed mark he received point dagger his arm. The coat cut open, skin slightly ripped blood flowed, though serious injury done. This fortunate miss Italian, made his escape stairs, street, darkness he easily eluded pursuit. "Are hurt, doctor?" asked Jack. "Only got scratch, mere flesh wound. Do know fellow?" reply. "Unfortunately I do; he hired assassin." "This bottle deadly poison, escaped miracle." The pistol-shot aroused whole house, every one came rushing room. In hurried manner doctor explained happened, cleared room, gave Jack composing draught. Alfred Van Hoosen much chagrined dastardly crime attempted his house, notified police. No arrest made, however, every effort find Italian unsuccessful. Time passed on, ten days, Jack quite well, though still little weak. His friends came see every day, he determined return his hotel. Having announced his intention Alfred, he thanked warmly his kindness. All traces animosity faded away, he reality friend family. Lena smiled upon him, sincerely rejoiced his recovery, first, woman's nervous anxiety, she despaired of. As he going away, Alfred drew one side. "You will not think rude," he said. "But I like ask questions." "By means," replied Jack. "In first place, Italian he persecute you?" "He attempted life board ship; I reason think he put wallet belonging Mr. Cobb pocket; he frightened horse he endeavored poison me." "But why? It incomprehensible me." Jack hesitated moment, colored slightly. "I tell you, since urge me," he replied. "Lord Maltravers rivals sister's hand." "Ah! I suspected much." "Bambino, Italian, paid spy assassin Maltravers." Alfred Van Hoosen appeared confused, look vexation crossed his face. "I heard Lord Maltravers mother," he said; "of course I prejudiced you, first, account affair Mr. Cobb's; removed." "Thank you," replied Jack. "I glad hear say so, I want stand well you." "We Americans quite punctilious particular English," said Van Hoosen; "and I tell best families think much aristocrats descended Normans." "Why not?" "Well, friends. You proved man, Harkaway, I shall always esteem you." "May I beg one favor?" exclaimed Jack. "Anything power, grant, command," warm reply. "It useless disguise fact I love sister, I every reason believe she indifferent me. Will use influence her, behalf?" The expression vexation Jack previously remarked deepened Alfred's face. "I so," he replied; "but I fear avail you." "Will explain reason?" "Yes, well candid you: mother, Lena respect beyond every one everything else world, made her mind sister shall contract distinguished alliance." "What mean that? I gentleman I moderate income." "Do not think moment," Alfred hastened say, "that I intended cast reflection upon you. My mother tried Paris make Lena marry French count, she set her heart English lord." Jack felt quivering heart. "Noblemen scarce democratic country," he said. "Admitted; mother already selected her future son-in-law." "Will kindly tell fortunate scion aristocracy is?" inquired Jack, cold, hard voice. "It enemy." "Lord Maltravers?" "The same," replied Alfred Van Hoosen. Jack flushed indignation. "But, dear sir, I already told you," he exclaimed, "the man scoundrel." "True; must band together save Lena. I time. Yet danger imminent. We dispatch." "From his lordship?" "Yes, he expected to-day." Jack looked blankly Van Hoosen. "Maltravers to-day?" he ejaculated. "I fought duel France, I thought sword-thrust I gave him, would disable time come." A servant entered room sitting. "What it, John?" "Lord Maltravers down-stairs, sir, Mrs. Van Hoosen requests presence." The young men looked one another. "Say I indisposed," exclaimed Alfred; "desire mother make excuses." "Yes, sir." "And John--where sister?" "Miss Van Hoosen out, sir," replied servant. Alfred put his arm Jack drew room. "Come," he said, "I walk hotel. I want talk way." They passed down-stairs street, Jack's consolation news he heard, knowledge brother girl he loved his friend. As walked along, Alfred said: "I finish asking questions I wanted to. What brought friends here?" "Frankly," answered Jack, "I came see sister. My friends came find buffaloes New York." Alfred Van Hoosen burst roar laughter. "Buffaloes New York!" he said. "You surely serious." "Indeed I am." "Why, might well look Indians Staten Island. Is possible educated Englishmen, friends must be, ignorant?" "The average Englishman," replied Jack, "knows much America, he Kamschatka." "Who friends yours?" "You seen them, called house time I sick. There Captain Cannon, Mr. Twinkle, Professor Mole Harvey, though latter foolish rest." Alfred reflected moment. "We fun them," he said. "Of course post Harvey." "How?" inquired Jack. "An uncle mine, one time rich eccentric, farm New Jersey, far New York, his pet idea tame buffalo make subservient husbandry." "Has he his farm?" "A score more. Uncle away Philadelphia. The farm charge old servant family, I I like." "What is plan?" "I invite friends grand buffalo-hunt New Jersey." "But uncle!" "Never mind him; I his favorite nephew he made his favor." "He may revoke it." "Not he. The old boy loves joke well," replied Alfred. "Shall it?" "Willingly." "That settled, then. I make arrangements to-day, good enough invite friends behalf, start early to-morrow." "So soon?" "Why delay? little fun relieve mind." "But regard Maltravers?" "Leave me. I friend. You wholly understand service riding horse win. You saved financial ruin, made friend life." "Yet he meet sister. You away mother's influence may--" "Be easy, Harkaway. If I voice matter, he shall never marry Lena!" exclaimed Van Hoosen. "If--" "Well, I mean, court knows herself I think she does. Good-by. I go home, see thing works, talk Lena. To-morrow shall hear she says." This speech Alfred Van Hoosen's cheered Jack considerably. Since he made friends Alfred inmate his mother's house, his love Lena doubled intensity. He felt he could live without her. The presence Lord Maltravers New York standing menace accomplishment his marriage Lena. He bitter, unscrupulous unrelenting enemy deal with. It already shown he would stop nothing. With heart full conflicting emotions, Jack went his hotel. CHAPTER XI. FORTUNE-TELLING. When Alfred Van Hoosen quitted Harkaway he dropped Union Club played couple games billiards. He played badly, his thoughts intent anything game. "Beaten again," said his friend; "what matter afternoon?" "My right hand lost cunning." "Play another?" "Not to-day, excuse me," said Alfred. Two gentlemen entered room approached Van Hoosen, one saying: "Ah! Van, glad see you. I want make acquainted friend, Lord Maltravers. Just arrived England. He brought letter introduction tells he met people Paris." Alfred shook hands his friend, named Sinclair, well known banker Wall street, he bowed somewhat stiffly peer. The latter placed glass his eye, stared somewhat rudely Van Hoosen. "Pleased know you, know," he exclaimed. "But I thought form; mother sent you, indisposed; preferred playing billiards seeing me, eh?" "I choose occupation, I guess," replied Alfred, like his lordship's manner. The tone he addressed offensive. "Oh! certainly; I forgive anything brother charming sister." "I do not want forgive anything. Lord Maltravers," said Alfred haughtily, "and I beg, all, dare take liberty mentioning Miss Van Hoosen's name billiard-room." "But it is club, know." "That makes difference; do not it." "Eh?" said his lordship, calling eye-glass requisition again. "Do not _dare_ it." "Did say dare?" "Certainly I did. Is necessary repeat it?" replied Alfred, turning away. Maltravers stared him, taking cue began knock balls about, remarking he so: "Queer people, Americans." Sinclair ran Alfred, caught door. "What is got you?" he asked. "Oh! nothing," evasive answer. "I did not think would insult friend mine." "Excuse me, I reasons. The fellow conciliatory me, I am running English lords now. Good-afternoon." Alfred left club, ever inclined support Jack Harkaway. Dinner ready, he reached home, meal over, he opportunity speaking his sister. Mrs. Van Hoosen gone opera, accepted seat Lord Maltravers's box, Lena remained home plea severe headache. The brother sister sat lounge together, Alfred slipped his arm round her waist. "You stayed home, baby," he said, "because did not want meet _him_." "Whom mean?" asked Lena. "This English puppy, Lord Maltravers. Is so, sis?" "Yes, dear," she replied. "When see him?" "To-day, club, came near row." "What about?" "He mentioned name, I told I care sister spoken public place." "That right," said Lena. "Tell me, pet, like best, Maltravers Harkaway?" Lena blushed scarlet. "I esteem Mr. Harkaway much," she replied. "Esteem?" he repeated. "Is cold?" "Well, far love goes, I know I love one." "Yet lots admirers." "Have I?" "Why, certainly have, pretty girl like deserves them. But tell me, care upstart lord?" "Mamma says he blood forty generations his veins, representative one first noble families England." "I know mamma's weakness, I ashamed it; let put plainly. If choice two men, would rather marry?" "What think?" replied Lena arch smile. "Harkaway." "You welcome opinion. I contradict you. Yet, Alfred, I cannot offend mother, I must civil man, I freely admit, I like." "If ever marry him, I will never speak again." "That would terrible punishment," said Lena, "for know full well, much I think you, Alfred." "I know it, sis, advice consult happiness." "I cannot happy I offend mamma." "But cannot happy marry Lord Maltravers." "That dilemma," said Lena, "and I get it?" Alfred Van Hoosen shook his head. "Give days think matter over," he replied, "and perhaps I see way difficulty. One thing I know, I would rather see drop dead altar, become wife man." "Oh! Alfred. What dreadful language!" "You know much I do. I Harkaway's friend now, I do not want encourage Maltravers. You much me?" "I make promise." "Why not?" "I must obey mamma--oh!" she added, tears flooded her eyes, "I wish I never born!" "That foolish wish." "No. You never known struggle inclination duty," said Lena. "That do. I satisfied answer!" cried Alfred Van Hoosen. "Be true yourself, sis, trust inventive faculties make happy." He kissed his sister affectionately, she sought privacy her chamber. In little she grew tired alone, threw aside book she endeavored read. Ringing her bell, she summoned her maid she brought Paris her; bright little brunette named Fifine. "Did ma'm'selle ring?" she asked. "Yes, tell myself. I _distraite_." "Is ma'm'selle go theater?" asked Fifine. "But no, she go alone. _Tiens_! Why fortune told?" "Where?" said Lena, struck novel suggestion. "There one clairvoyant street, always tells true. She called Vesta Levine." "Have there?" "_Oui_, ma'm'selle, she tell I shall day marry prince, much money he spend it." "That encouraging," said Miss Van Hoosen smile. "Give hat; go fortune-teller, I like know I likely marry." "In France," exclaimed Fifine, "women never marry; men marry them. What difference? marriage lottery." Lena quickly attired. With her face hidden thick vail, accompanied her maid she went visit clairvoyant spoken highly. She faith art fortune-telling, believed astrology nonsense, every woman's breast slight undercurrent superstition. Consequently she fancied, spite her reason, might something it. The madame's house far she resided, five minutes walking brought her it. Fifine rung bell, ushered domestic, room dimly lighted.

They obeyed silent summons, curtain fell behind them, undefinable feeling dread came Lena. Madame Levine well-preserved woman forty, pale, delicate, classic face, large dreamy eyes. She simply attired black silk wore jewelry. The inner apartment found plainly furnished. Reclining couch young girl appeared asleep. This Adéle Bellefontaine, poor insane victim Lord Maltravers's deceit, placed clairvoyant care protection. Madame Levine long discovering girl possessed remarkable mediumistic properties, she soon tested her powers; result encouraging she kept her trance half time. "Be seated, ladies," said clairvoyant. "If wish fortune revealed, fee five dollars. You address questions medium lounge." Lena Van Hoosen handed her money, madame sat small harmonium, she drew sweet plaintive strains. The music loud enough drown sound voices, Lena, low, trembling tones, said: "Shall I ever married?" "Yes," replied Adéle. "To whom?" "An Englishman." She thought Harkaway Lord Maltravers, nationality. To two medium refer? "Two men love you," continued Adéle. "I know it, heaven's sake two fate?" cried Lena, scarcely able suppress her emotion. Adéle's fingers nervously clutched gold locket hung round her neck. "Come!" she said. Lena Van Hoosen advanced like one dream. "Look," continued Adéle. Unclasping locket she gazed upon face within. "Lord Maltravers!" she gasped. "It he marry," replied medium. Lena staggered back fell heavily floor. The revelation much her, she fainted away. Adéle continued lie trance apparently unconscious going around her. CHAPTER XII. MRS. VAN HOOSEN SACRIFICES HER DAUGHTER TO HER AMBITION.

"In house clairvoyant, ma'm'selle," answered Fifine. "Where Madame Levine?" "Gone. She took medium away, went together." "Oh! bring here?" said Lena, wringing her hands piteously. "Ma'm'selle wished know she would marry, seems English suitor rich handsome." "Be silent." Fifine shrugged her shoulders. "For part, I wish he would love well enough marry me," she continued. "You impertinent. Let us go home," replied her mistress. Just she arranged her shawl take her departure, Madame Levine entered apartment. "Are satisfied?" she inquired. "I bewildered. I know think," answered Lena. "Oh! that, always rely upon predictions medium, really remarkable." "But she told I marry man I hate." "Then so." "Can explain she came portrait Lord Maltravers her locket?" asked Lena. "That mysterious locket," said Mme. Levine; "in ordinary times perfectly blank. When medium wishes think particular individual, face represented glass." Lena smiled, incredulously. "I cannot believe that," she said. The madame touched small bell, silvery cadence scarcely died away servant attached house entered. "Bring Adéle," she exclaimed. The domestic bowed departed. "Oh!" said Lena, her breath. "Her name Adéle." Presently Adéle Bellefontaine, pale delicate, entered room, absent air. She seem notice one. "Child," exclaimed Madame Levine. Adéle started pressed her hand her head pain.

Lena reached home short time her mother returned opera, waited drawing-room receive her. Mrs. Van Hoosen come back alone. She accompanied Lord Maltravers.

"I told he answer week, I gave understand I could never love him." "I sorry that, I set heart marrying man. You must become Lady Maltravers I disown you. Girls know what is good them."

It settled marriage take place month, papers contained following announcement: "ENGAGED.--Lena Van Hoosen, daughter late Cornelius Van Hoosen, Lord Maltravers peerage Great Britain." This appearance sealed her fate. CHAPTER XIII. "A BUFFALO-HUNT." Alfred Van Hoosen kept his word relation buffalo-hunt, early fine morning party took cars his uncle's farm Jersey. Captain Cannon Mr. Twinkle high spirits, even Mr. Mole looked forward excellent sport. Jack Harvey pretended enthusiastic rest, Van Hoosen discoursed upon danger attending hunt one engage in. When old homestead reached, Alfred apologized absence his uncle, still away Philadelphia, honors house himself. Old Stock, steward, posted Alfred, spread excellent lunch table, provided rifles ammunition party, none them, except Alfred, Jack Harvey, knew cartridges blank. It would never done kill buffalo, Alfred's uncle would pardoned outrage. Champagne flowed briskly, every one high spirits. "Are many buffalo, sir, Jersey?" inquired Captain Cannon, Alfred. "Considerable," replied Alfred. "But many were. They gradually killed off." "When India," continued captain, "I shot tiger breakfast, regularly, every day, year." "Come, come! That drawing long bow," said Mr. Twinkle. "I shot lion week, Africa, six months, tiger every day, much." "Fact, I assure you, sir." "I quite believe it," said Professor Mole. "For I China I used kill score alligators, every day, keep hand in." "Well, gentlemen," exclaimed Alfred, "suppose show skill buffalo." They jumped up, grasped rifles, took supply cartridges, started park big game grazing. It raining slightly, Mr. Mole provided umbrella, add his sportsmanlike appearance. The professor also carried note-book, record interesting fact concerning day's hunt, he could send report President Travelers' Club. "Fine undulating country," he wrote. "Buffalo-grass observable. Jersey favorite home remarkable animal." After walking half hour came upon old bull standing tree. "Ha! What here?" cried Captain Cannon. "That is buffalo," replied Van Hoosen. "Dear me, I taken cow. How savage he looks!" "Yes. The buffalo his wild, untamed state ferocious. Now, gentlemen, Harkaway, Harvey stay here, three go stalk game. If he escapes _you_, bring down." "Thank you," replied captain. "Advance, friends. This glorious moment." It observable Mr. Twinkle trembled violently could scarcely hold his gun. The three advanced together slowly, neither would go ahead others. Van Hoosen made signal Jack Harvey, followed thicket. Here old Stock, steward, securely hidden, awaiting coming. "What is wind now?" asked Jack. "We are bound scare friends, I want dress Indians. Stock everything ready us, even pot red paint." Jack struck attitude. "Heap big Injun, ugh!" he exclaimed, amid much laughter. They quickly proceeded disguise themselves, tied feathers hair, put war-paint, slung blankets shoulders. While dressing three buffalo-hunters approaching old bull, watched much curiosity displayed regard him. "Twinkle," said captain, "you entitled first shot." "N-no," replied Twinkle, chattering teeth. "Think ought honor." "I decline it." "Then means let Mr. Mole attack beast. How fierce he looks, terrible horns he has! Go in, Mole, slay him!" "That do," replied Mole. "I lie grass he cannot see me." "What use that?" "Do not see? I take steady shot savage creature he will not know hit him." The professor waste time words. He threw long grass, Captain Cannon retired behind unfortunate Twinkle. The latter never his life shot anything bigger sparrow spite his boasting, he thoroughly alarmed. "Bless me!" exclaimed captain. "Where Harkaway fellows?" "Not gone, they?" inquired Twinkle. "I cannot see anywhere." "The cowards! They run away left us face music! That is _mean_," said Twinkle. The bull moment left shelter tree advanced toward intruders his domain. "He is a-coming!" gasped Twinkle. "Fire!" said captain. Mr. Twinkle grasped his gun fiercely, shut his eyes, turned his back buffalo, fired. The blank cartridge struck Captain Cannon, hurting considerably tender portion his body--not front neither. "Oh-h!!! I am shot!" he said, clapping his hands place dropping his gun. "Shot! I hit you?" asked Mr. Twinkle, innocently. "Did you? Why, confounded idiot, I am covered blood. Look here!" captain gasped, indignantly. He withdrew his hands wound regarded ruby fluid grimly. "I am sorry." "Sorry hanged! What good me? Perhaps I shall die, lose leg; anyway, I know I shall not able sit comfort week." "I apologize. It--it shall not occur again," replied Twinkle. "I do not know happened. This horrid old gun. I never shot funny gun before." "It is opinion you are afraid, sir," shouted captain. "Why do not load up?" "I distinctly refuse so, sir," retorted Twinkle; "and injurious language used me, sir, I shall retire shoot leave kill buffalo yourself." Saying this, he ran away hid behind neighboring tree. The captain looked contemptuously. Meanwhile bull getting nearer, necessary something check his progress. Taking steady aim, Captain Cannon discharged his piece, surprised see animal remain unharmed. Loading up, he fired again, beast fall, though he grew enraged, uttering defiant snort, charged. The captain ran his might succeeded reaching tree, behind he sheltered himself. "Shoot him, Mole!" he cried. "You have capital chance; let brute it, foreleg." The professor fired, better luck others; bull, his attention diverted, took survey his new enemy. Snorting again, he charged professor, sprung his feet, threw away his gun, want better weapon, opened his umbrella. Probably buffalo never seen offshoot civilization, he much alarmed. Turning tail, he fled ignominiously field battle, soon lost sight. "Bravo," cried captain. "Victory!" shouted Mr. Twinkle. They emerged shelter warmly congratulated professor his exploit. "It happy thought," said Mole. "I make note it. 'The buffalo, though impervious bullets, fly sight umbrella.'" "I think better go home," exclaimed Twinkle. "And I second motion," replied captain; "for wound becoming stiff painful. We actually seen buffalo terrific encounter it. This sufficient report society." "Quite," remarked Mole. "I perfectly satisfied." Suddenly startled fearful yell, made jump. Looking round, beheld three red Indians majesty paint, feathers tomahawks. "Oh!! look!!!!" exclaimed Twinkle, "we shall robbed murdered!" "Indians!" said captain. "Why Mr. Van Hoosen warn us danger? I thought wretches kept reservations guarded government troops." "They cannot scalp me," remarked Mole. "Why not?" "I wear wig, welcome, spare life." "Whoop! la whoop!" yelled Indians, dancing eccentric circles. Twinkle fell his knees, clasping his hands begged mercy. "Oh! good, kind gentlemen!" he said. "Have pity poor Englishman far away home, came interest science." "Ugh! take scalp, want heap scalp put wigwam," replied Indian. "I have little hair, sir; scarcely worth taking." "My white brother squaw, he heart dog; pale-face coward; ugh! I spoken." Captain Cannon Mr. Mole followed Twinkle's example sunk knees. They looked comical undignified position. The Indians stood them, selecting his victim threatening tomahawk one hand scalping-knife other. Jack knocked professor's hat making rapid circle his knife, lifted wig. "Ha! white man heap big fraud," he exclaimed he hung wig his belt. "I am sorry, sir," replied Mole. "But I could not help growing bald. It is misfortune, fault--nature it--all family lose hair quite early life." "Give watch, money!" "Certainly, greatest pleasure life," said Mole, emptying his pockets. He handed currency, watch chain, chewing tobacco small flask spirits. "What this? fire-water, hey?" "Yes, good, kind sir. It is old rye whisky." "If bad, Indian kill lying pale-face," said Jack, tasting whisky handing Harvey Van Hoosen, evinced satisfaction guttural sounds grunts. Harvey contented cutting Mr. Twinkle's hair short he could, Van Hoosen fire-eating captain. They tore hats close-cropped looked come jail, Mole's polished crown shone sunshine like ball ivory. Mr. Twinkle captain give valuables, gladly, thinking lucky escape lives. "White men crawl belly, like snake, kiss Indians' feet," exclaimed Jack. "I do not care that," replied Mole. Jack flourished his knife. "White dog want die?" he asked. "Oh! no. Not yet. I will it," cried Mole, hastily. Jack retreated several paces, professor crawled toward him, kissing his feet. Van Hoosen Harvey made captives thing. "Whoop!" cried Jack, "we leave white squaws now." He took another drink flask, his companions same, vanished thicket mysteriously come. "That narrow escape," said professor. "Yes, indeed," replied Captain Cannon. "I shall fine story tell I get back London. First, I killed savage buffalo bull, wilds New Jersey." "You did not kill him," observed Mr. Twinkle. "Did not I?" "No, indeed. I think honor belongs me." "Any way, shot something myself. I will forgive you, let say, without fear contradiction, I slew buffalo." "You may well tell good lie it," said Mr. Mole. "_I_ always do." "I remarked already," observed captain. "A small falsehood contemptible thing, glory big one." "In way I amend mine?" "Say encounter bull he tossed his horns, show wound corroboration story," replied professor. The captain relish allusion his wound, situated inglorious portion his anatomy. Mr. Mole picked flask, empty, discovered fact, his disgust found vent words. "These Indians meanest wretches I ever met with," he said. "What done now?" inquired Mr. Twinkle. "Emptied flask--drained _dry_, sir, Jove! I intended solace quiet drink, human aspirations ever destined dashed ground." He sighed deeply. "Let us go back house enjoy Mr. Van Hoosen's hospitality," suggested Mr. Twinkle. "I believe motion seconded carried, moments ago," said captain. "It was," replied professor. "Then I give word command. By right, march! And I ever come buffalo-hunting Jersey wilds again, may Lord forgive me." The three men marched disconsolately toward house, arranged among say encountered band Indians, who, severe fight, overpowered sheer force numbers. "Let tell story," exclaimed Mole, "and corroborate I say." "Good!" cried captain Mr. Twinkle. "I do not mind little romancing," continued Mole. "It comes naturally me, I know requires effort part, gentlemen." The sportsmen smiled quickened pace, anxious reach homestead, enjoy good things felt sure Mr. Van Hoosen would regale with. When arrived house, met door Alfred, Jack Harvey. "What sport meet with, sir?" asked Harkaway. "Splendid, dear boy," replied Mr. Mole. "You missed it." "Is so?" "We killed buffalo bull--at least, he hit went away thicket die. If tribe Indians attacked us, capital day's gunning." "Did Indians fight you?" "Yes, sir," answered Mr. Mole. "We absolutely surrounded fifty red fiends, showed determined front beat off." "Did kill any?" "Did we. Well, I smile not," answered Mr. Mole. "Where dead?" "Ask comrades. When saw defeated, retired disorder, carried dead them." "Carried dead?" "Yes. I give credit that." "But occur wig gone gentlemen hair cut short?" inquired Harkaway. Mr. Mole looked little confused. "Oh! I explain that," he said; "on way home attacked horde tramps." "A horde?" "Yes, score, exhausted encounter Indians surrendered discretion." "That rough you, sir. It indeed. Did tramps rob anything?" "All possessed; beat Indians, possessed cartridges driven tramps." "That good story," said Jack. Mr. Mole looked indignant. "What mean insinuation?" he exclaimed. "Do doubt honor?" "Oh! no. Not moment." "Then good story?" "Simply best lie, Mr. Mole, I heard long time." Captain Cannon struck his breast his hand Mr. Twinkle looked unutterable things Jack. "_I_ concerned allegation," said captain. "Did I allegate anything?" asked Jack. "Yes, sir, I deny allegation despise allegator." "That is stale joke," replied Jack. "But look here, gentlemen, Indians cut hair took Mr. Mole's wig, return hirsute appendages. If tramps robbed money valuables give back." "_You_!" "Yes, sir," continued Harkaway; "what say this?" "And this?" cried Harvey. "And this?" added Van Hoosen. They severally displayed spoils taken, placing table. The consternation dismay three pretenders funny extreme. "Then Indians!" said professor; grasping tail end joke feebly. "We were," answered Jack. "But it?" "Oh! dressed up, determined fun you, harm done, I hope forgive joke." "I do," replied professor; "and I may add I knew you, Jack, along." "You did?" "If I had not known it, think I would allowed take wig." "Allowed me?" "Yes.

"Never mind, grossly deceived me, I consider joke insult, sir." "Do you?" said Jack, coldly. "Yes, sir, I do. Look hair! take month grow. I shall leave country once." "If do, country will not miss you. I do not think general mourning, nation go bankruptcy." Mr. Twinkle put his hat savage air. "I shall go, too," he said. "By means. Go to--Hong Kong Halifax, like."

"So I heard say before." "We stay partake hospitality, sir." "Nobody asked you. I gave shot uncle's old tame buffalo bull, blank cartridges, done that, I inclination anything you." "Blank cartridges!" ejaculated captain. "The deuce," said Mr. Twinkle. "That lucky you, Cannon, I fired round corner; I might settled you, altogether." "Come!" replied captain, grandly. "One word go, gentlemen," exclaimed Alfred Van Hoosen. "You, educated men, ought idiots suppose would find buffaloes Indians New York State Jersey, cannot blame me, playful American, joke you, especially better-informed friend, Mr. Harkaway, assisted me." "I nothing say," replied Captain Cannon. "Nor I," replied Mr. Twinkle. "For part, I do not like country, people are--" Alfred Van Hoosen stared him, fixedly. "Are what?" he asked. Mr. Twinkle made least little nervous start. "Oh! perfect gentlemen, course," he added. "Come!" said captain. "The gentlemen shall hear us." "By cable, I guess," laughed Alfred. "Do join us, Mr. Mole?" asked captain, noticing remark Van Hoosen. "Well--no," answered professor. "I knew lark through, I never bite nose spite face, I forgive Jack time, stay lunch good friend, Mr. Van Hoosen." He held his hand. "No animosity, Al?" he added. "Not slightest world, dear fellow," replied Van Hoosen. Captain Cannon Mr. Twinkle walked room together, fully determined return England next steamer. As went, Alfred sung, others joining chorus: "We will settle banks Of lovely Ohio, Through wild woods we will wend As hunt buffalo" And refrain rung ears way depot: "As hunt buff-a-lo." CHAPTER XIV. MASTER AND SLAVE. Lord Maltravers naturally much elated his success winning Lena Van Hoosen's consent marry him. He really much love young lady, intended settle live quiet life her. That he got rid Adéle Bellefontaine forever, he doubt moment. Everything progressed favorably him, his plans gradually approached fruition. A days appointed marriage, Bambino entered his master's private room, he breakfast. He sat air easy familiarity, unusual him. "What want?" asked Maltravers, looking his paper. "My discharge," replied Bambino. Lord Maltravers put glass his eye regarded curiously. "Your what?" he asked. "My discharge. Is necessary repeat it?" "But, good fellow, life-long star.

"Well?" "You sent back Italy, pass remainder natural life galleys." "Yes, that is true," said Bambino, calmly. "Reflect, friend," continued Maltravers. "However fond may hard work black bread, however much may enamored whip taskmaster, notwithstanding charm hot sun may you, I venture say, service agreeable." "I wish quit service, sigñor." "And I say again, I permit so. It always one pick accomplished villain are." "Do I suit well?" "So well, I part you." "I finished villain?" Bambino asked, strange voice. "Perfect every respect." "You fault find me?" "None." Bambino smiled quietly, pleased original idea occurred him. "Give fifty thousand dollars," he exclaimed, "and I trouble more." Lord Maltravers started his chair, seized cane. "Dog," he said, "am I stand impertinence?" "Yes." "You say 'yes!' know talking?" Bambino rose displayed his dagger. "Cospetto!" he cried. "Touch not. If much lay little finger me, I stab heart." Maltravers dropped cane. "Oh! decidedly," he said, "I shall go Italian Consul." "No, lord," replied Bambino. "It I, go British Consul." Maltravers turned pale rage. "Do threaten _me_, low scoundrel?" he exclaimed. "Yes, I do." "What say, except I hired commit crime--that is, I employed kill Jack Harkaway?" "I shall go upon that." "If one would believe you." "Possibly not," said Bambino, calmly. "But, lord, suppose I said _had wife alive_." Again Maltravers changed color perceptibly. "If would lie," he replied. "Oh! no. I perfectly conversant little marriage France." "Yes. I talked it, possibly, confidential moments." "More that--I know wife moment, I produce her altar attempt marry Miss Van Hoosen." "You villain!" "My lord," said Bambino, "you honor. I feel proud complimented you." He bowed low he spoke, mock humility. "Prove allege," cried Maltravers, intensely excited. "That is easy enough." "Begin!" "It necessary show cards," returned Bambino. "I I say, I so, unless buy off." "I refuse anything kind." "You defy me?" "I do." "Perhaps Mr. Harkaway may generous." "Do threaten appeal rival?" "Yes, lord," answered Bambino. Lord Maltravers beside rage insolent defiance, he controlled exercise violent effort. "Let us understand one another," he said. "By means." "You allege know existence lady claims wife, say, she New York produce her moment's notice, stop marriage Miss Van Hoosen?" "Precisely." "And price silence require $50,000?" "That sum." "Where girl?" continued his lordship. "I decline say." "What is her name?" "That know well I do. Will give money?" "No!" Bambino shrugged his shoulders, he advanced door. "Then, I declare war knife," he said. "Yes. You cowardly ruffians always use knife. I prefer pistol," replied his lordship. He went rapidly escritoire drew ivory-handled pistol. "This answer you," he cried. Bambino shrunk back, he unable avoid ball his lordship fired him. There explosion, puff smoke crafty Italian fell floor, blood welling wound his head. Hastily Lord Maltravers placed pistol death-like clutch his victim. Then he rung bell violently. This tragedy occurred one leading hotels could hushed up. When waiter answered bell, his lordship perfectly calm. "This man, servant," he exclaimed, "has despondent lately, I would allow return Italy, he committed suicide. Summon proprietor hotel!" The servant hastened so. When proprietor arrived, he told story, he saw reason disbelieve, and, ambulance sent for, Bambino taken hospital. No report made police, wonder reporter got hold circumstance. Lord Maltravers followed his servant hospital, appeared much concerned his condition. After house surgeon made examination he prepared his report. "Is serious?" inquired Maltravers. "Very," reply. "Will he live?" "No. The man die." Lord Maltravers could scarcely contain his exultation announcement. "Allow ask one question," he exclaimed. "With pleasure," answered house surgeon. "Will poor fellow recover consciousness he expires?" "Possibly he will. I cannot say positively." "When expect death ensue?" "Inside forty-eight hours." Lord Maltravers went away, slightly disturbed his mind. If Bambino recovered consciousness brief period, he might talk. There danger that. If he denounced Lord Maltravers his murderer, he pointed place Adéle Bellefontaine living, his lordship's newly-found happiness would topple like pack cards built house hand child, whose breath subsequently destroys frail edifice. Eagerly he longed time pass. Three times day he called hospital. His last visit twelve of the clock. Bambino yet spoken. CHAPTER XV. MR. MOLE PLAYS BASE-BALL. Captain Cannon Mr. Twinkle went back England famous buffalo-hunt, feeling insulted trick played upon them. Jack, Harvey Professor Mole remained hotel. It may readily imagined Jack enviable frame mind. Alfred Van Hoosen his friend wished marry his sister, Lena promised espouse Lord Maltravers, great mother's influence day already fixed. Jack expected every day Alfred would come propose plan means celebration marriage could prevented. He waited vain fumed fretted he grew ill pale. Little he know time Lord Maltravers uneasy he himself. He knew nothing dangerous condition villain Bambino, Maltravers standing, were, volcano might time erupt scatter his fond ideas winds, dash his happiness atoms shatter idol he set worship. If Bambino recovered sufficiently speak, hope union Lena Van Hoosen end. While affairs condition, Mr. Mole made acquaintance young man living his parents hotel. It happened way. The Continental Hotel, Broadway, caravansera Harkaway members Travelers' Club stayed at, genial proprietor, Mr. Merrifield, much interested eccentric professor. Meeting hall one morning, seated chair his legs another, Mr. Merrifield said: "I thought English custom, professor, put legs angle forty-five degrees? "My dear sir," replied Mole, "there nothing country Englishman cannot done his land." "Can drink whisky straight?" "Try me," said Mole, twinkle his eye. "Can play base-ball?" "I think so. The fact is, I good cricket player, I see reason I play emasculated game call base-ball." "Well now," said Merrifield, "I will give opportunity showing direction." "How?" "A young gentleman living house his parents, whose name Morris Hart, captain Blue Stockings, club going play Red Stockings match to-day." "Well?" "The Blues short one nine. You shall take place missing man, like." "I will it." "Mind," said Mr. Merrifield, "you said good base-ball player." "Did I say so?" "Yes, lose match bad play, shall blame you." "I understand." "Of course," Mr. Merrifield continued, "I reflecting veracity. I know well Englishman never blows. It American brags his country says he whip creation." "Well," replied professor. "I do not mind repeating I must good base-ball player, mild edition call 'Rounders,' game small boys play cannot spoken breath cricket." "But base-ball dangerous game play." "Oh! pshaw!" "People often get arms legs broken." "Nonsense. You see swift round hand bowling. That would open eyes little." As professor spoke young man approached; he tall, well formed handsome. "Ah!" said Mr. Merrifield. "You man I looking for. Professor Mole, allow introduce friend, Mr. Morris Hart." They bowed shook hands. "Glad know you, sir," said Morris. "I proud happy reciprocate sentiment, young friend," replied Mr. Mole. "Morris," exclaimed Mr. Merrifield, "you short man match 'Reds' to-day, I believe?" "We are, I cannot find substitute anywhere. Guess shall play eight nine." "No indeed. The professor volunteers fill vacant place." "Is so?" replied Morris Hart. "I real pleased hear it, but--" "What?" "I do not want disparage professor's accomplishments. Yet I always heard English understand national game." Mr. Mole smiled disdainfully. "Child's play," he said. "What is?" "Base-ball." Morris Hart bridled this. "You will not find so," he rejoined. "Not much," said Mr. Merrifield. "You bet high monkey munk." "Well, well," exclaimed Mr. Mole, "the proof pudding eating. I call base-ball scientific game, kind permission, I show old cricketer play." "Agreed," said Morris Hart. This settled, Mr. Merrifield left together, arranged Mr. Mole go grounds Hoboken certain hour. Morris gave club clothes, blue stockings, etc., he put grip sack left him, exacting promise he would time. Mr. Mole sooner possessed cap, shirt, drawers stockings, he went his room put on. Very comical indeed his appearance, his long, gaunt, angular form made look like animated scarecrow. Anxious display himself, he went Harkaway's room, finding Jack Harvey engaged conversation. "Say, boys," exclaimed professor, "what think me?" They regarded astonishment. "What lunacy this?" inquired Jack. "Eh!" exclaimed Harvey, "what it?" "I give up," replied Jack. "Give up?" "Yes. Ask easier one." "It must escaped menagerie," said Harvey. Mr. Mole regarded lofty air. "No doubt think mighty funny," he remarked. "But run me, like. I going show Yankees Englishman play base-ball." "You going play?" "Yes, boys. I Blue shirt, cap, stocking, I forget which, I know I am blue." "Perhaps black blue get through," said Jack. "Good major," ejaculated Harvey, laughing. "All right, boys. Have little jokes old man, see I shall paralyze Americans play." "I wish luck," answered Harkaway, "and would go you, I expect Van Hoosen here." "Is fresh news marriage?" asked Mole. "None. Mrs. Van Hoosen made her mind Lena shall marry Maltravers," replied Jack. "Misguided girl!" "She is, indeed. I every reason know she love him, mistaken sense duty her mother makes her accept him." "What going it?" "What I do? The marriage take place to-morrow." "So soon?" "Yes. I give word I nearly crazy, I love girl better life." Mr. Mole heaved deep sigh. "I loved once," he said, "and wife used go scalp, effect destroying love's young dream." "I think so," replied Harvey. "But, dear sir," exclaimed Jack, "you admit, I hope, married life happiest state existence." "I will admit nothing." "No happiness found outside home circle." "It depends man's temperament, also man brought up. A Philadelphian happy home, New Yorker ignorant meaning word 'Home,'" replied Mr. Mole. "Oh! pshaw," said Jack, impatiently. "Have sense. Tell bliss comparable sweet little darling always house want her?" "Suppose she want her?" "I admit supposition. Go play game." "I will." "You Maltravers ought game." "Why?" "Because 'base.'" "Oh!" cried professor. "What I done deserve this? You called 'base.' I must go get 'ball' that." He walked closet he knew Jack kept sundry bottles wine liquors, helped draught brandy. "Well, boys," he exclaimed, "I must leave you, bet high monkey munk, friend Merrifield says, I lays power uphold honor old England, flag thousand years braved battle breeze." Waving his arm grandly he quitted apartment, making his preparations, started place appointed match. The Blue Stockings pretty strong team beaten Reds year previously, said Reds improved greatly, spirited contest expected. Mr. Mole knew nothing whatever game, wise enough keep his mouth shut, he spoken to. His side lost choice innings take field. The professor became much interested seeing men run base base, look keenly enough. What consequence? A ball struck fearful force knee. He ought stopped caught it, he did not, he fell ground broken leg. "Oh! oh!" he cried, "I am killed." Morris Hart ran see matter. "Why did not stop ball?" he asked. "It came fast, I could not," groaned unhappy professor. "I thought used fast bowling could play game." "So I thought." "It is opinion you are first-class fraud." "Do not abuse me, good fellow," said Mole. "Send ambulance taken hospital: I am great pain cannot walk." "If so, pardon me." "My leg broken." "I am sorry, I always knew took American play base-ball." "Give cricket," moaned Mr. Mole. "It decent respectable game. You do not want get life insured engage it." Morris Hart could refrain smiling; he hurried away get conveyance would take Mr. Mole hospital. He would sent his hotel, professor wished best advice he could get, he knew he sure excellent treatment hospital. Accordingly he taken hospital New York put bed, surgeon set broken leg assured weeks he would able get crutches. "Heaven help me," said Mole. "What fool I getting old age. Here I strange country, ought known better indulge barbarous games people. Confound base-ball man invented it; serves right. I one blame." CHAPTER XVI. BAMBINO IN THE HOSPITAL. Mr. Mole accident ward, many poor wretches sighing groaning around him. In next bed right-hand side man appeared comatose state. Calling nurse he said, "What matter man there?" "He dying," reply. "Is so?" "It is case suicide. He Italian valet English nobleman, say." "What nobleman's name?" "Lord Maltravers." Mr. Mole, announcement, gave start nearly displaced splints around his leg. "Bambino!" he ejaculated. As he said this; man dying condition looked wide-open eyes. The mention his name seemed aroused state stupor he plunged. "Yes. I Bambino," he said, faint voice. "Who calls me?" "I," replied Mole. "Who you? My eyes dim. I cannot see you. All blank." "A friend." "What would me, friend?" "Who shot you?" This random question part professor, touched right chord. "My master," replied Bambino, he, Mr. Mole strange fatality placed ward bed next scoundrel. "Why he shoot you?" "Because he going marry young lady New York I told he wife alive would bigamy. I wanted money keep quiet he would give me. Then I threatened produce first wife, he shot me." The nurse standing by, listening strange conversation. "Did hear that?" inquired Mole. "Yes, sir," she replied. "Pay particular attention please, utmost importance friend mine required possibly witness." "Who first wife?" pursued Mole, "and her name?" "A French woman, Adéle Bellefontaine, living Madame Vesta Levine, clairvoyant, New York city!" The heavy lids fell eyes man lapsed state semi-consciousness. It nine of the clock evening. If professor's leg broken, he would got hastened Continental Hotel apprise Jack Harkaway would amply sufficient stop impending marriage morrow Lena Van Hoosen Lord Maltravers. The next day married ever marriage took place, Jack's heart would broken. Bambino's utterances ravings delirium, far it; he spoke coherently enough, given sufficient information enable Jack stop marriage. Adéle Bellefontaine--Madame Vesta Levine, clairvoyant--that enough. Surely could difficulty finding either them. CHAPTER XVII. JACK MAKES A LAST APPEAL. It morning appointed marriage. Harkaway miserable disconsolate. He seen Mr. Mole since day before, heard he hurt taken hospital. So he said Harvey: "Morris Hart tells old Mole got his leg broken playing base-ball. I suppose serious heard him.

"Harkaway," said his lordship. "Yes, enemy," reply. "I know it, good fellow, I am proud it." "Do not call 'good fellow,'" said Jack, blood rushed his face. "I shall call I please," exclaimed Lord Maltravers, cool insolence. Jack controlled himself, two men stood glaring one another. Under circumstances men hate intensely rivals affections woman. "Is not time, Mr. Harkaway, returned England?" said Lord Maltravers, his glass his eye. Jack gnashed his teeth. "You trying insult me," he exclaimed. "I hoped I succeeded," reply.
