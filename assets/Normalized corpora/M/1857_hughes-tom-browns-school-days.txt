 TOM BROWN'S SCHOOLDAYS PART I. CHAPTER I--THE BROWN FAMILY “I am Poet White Horse Vale, sir, With liberal notions cap.”--Ballad The Browns become illustrious pen Thackeray pencil Doyle, within memory young gentlemen matriculating universities. Notwithstanding well-merited late fame fallen upon them, one acquainted family must feel much yet written said British nation properly sensible much greatness owes Browns. For centuries, quiet, dogged, homespun way, subduing earth English counties, leaving mark American forests Australian uplands. Wherever fleets armies England renown, stalwart sons Browns done yeomen's work. With yew bow cloth-yard shaft Cressy Agincourt--with brown bill pike brave Lord Willoughby--with culverin demi-culverin Spaniards Dutchmen--with hand-grenade sabre, musket bayonet, Rodney St. Vincent, Wolfe Moore, Nelson Wellington, carried lives hands, getting hard knocks hard work plenty--which whole looked for, best thing them--and little praise pudding, indeed they, us, better without. Talbots Stanleys, St. Maurs, such-like folk, led armies made laws time mind; noble families would somewhat astounded--if accounts ever came fairly taken--to find small work England side Browns. These latter, indeed, have, present generation, rarely sung poet, chronicled sage. They wanted sacer vates, solid rise top themselves, largely gifted talent catching hold of, holding tight to, whatever good things happened going--the foundation fortunes many noble families. But world goes way, wheel turns, wrongs Browns, like wrongs, seem fair way get righted. And present writer, many years his life devout Brown-worshipper, and, moreover, honour nearly connected eminently respectable branch great Brown family, anxious, far lies, help wheel over, throw his stone pile. However, gentle reader, simple reader, whichever may be, lest led waste precious time upon pages, I make bold tell sort folk you will meet put with, I jog comfortably together. You shall hear sort folk Browns are--at least branch them; then, do not like sort, why, cut concern once, let I cry quits either us grumble other. In first place, Browns fighting family. One may question wisdom, wit, beauty, fight question. Wherever hard knocks kind, visible invisible, going; Brown nearest must shove his carcass. And carcasses, part, answer well characteristic propensity: squareheaded snake-necked generation, broad shoulder, deep chest, thin flank, carrying lumber. Then clanship, bad Highlanders; amazing belief one another. With nothing like Browns, third fourth generation. “Blood thicker water,” one pet sayings. They cannot happy unless always meeting one another. Never people family gatherings; which, stranger, sensitive, might think better gathered together. For whole time together luxuriate telling one another minds whatever subject turns up; minds wonderfully antagonistic, opinions downright beliefs. Till you have among time understand them, cannot think quarrelling. Not bit it. They love respect one another ten times good set family arguing bout, go back, one his curacy, another his chambers, another his regiment, freshened work, ever convinced Browns height company. This family training, too, combined turn combativeness, makes eminently quixotic. They cannot let anything alone think going wrong. They must speak mind it, annoying easy-going folk, spend time money tinker it, however hopeless job. It impossibility Brown leave disreputable lame dog side stile. Most folk get tired work. The old Browns, red faces, white whiskers, bald heads, go believing fighting green old age. They always crotchet going, till old man scythe reaps garners away troublesome old boys are. And provoking thing is, failures knock up, make hold hands, think you, me, sane people right. Failures slide like July rain duck's back feathers. Jem his whole family turn bad, cheat one week, next thing Jack; he goes treadmill, his wife children workhouse, lookout Bill take his place. However, time us get general particular; so, leaving great army Browns, scattered whole empire sun never sets, whose general diffusion I take chief empire's stability; let us fix attention upon small nest Browns hero hatched, dwelt portion royal county Berks called Vale White Horse. Most probably travelled Great Western Railway far Swindon. Those eyes open aware, soon leaving Didcot station, fine range chalk hills running parallel railway left-hand side go down, distant two three miles, less, line. The highest point range White Horse Hill, come front stop Shrivenham station. If love English scenery, hours spare, cannot better, next time pass, stop Farringdon Road Shrivenham station, make way highest point. And care vague old stories haunt country-sides England, not, wise, content hours' stay; for, glorious view is, neighbourhood yet interesting relics bygone times. I know two English neighbourhoods thoroughly, each, within circle five miles, enough interest beauty last reasonable man his life. I believe case almost throughout country, special attraction, none richer one I speaking going introduce particularly, subject I must prosy; do not care England detail may skip chapter. O young England! young England! born racing railroad times, there is Great Exhibition, monster sight, every year, get couple thousand miles ground three pound ten five-weeks' holiday, do not know birthplaces? You are ends earth, seems me, soon get necks educational collar, midsummer holidays, long vacations, not--going round Ireland, return ticket, fortnight; dropping copies Tennyson tops Swiss mountains; pulling Danube Oxford racing boats. And get home quiet fortnight, turn steam off, lie backs paternal garden, surrounded last batch books Mudie's library, half bored death. Well, well! I know good side. You patter French less, perhaps German; seen men cities, doubt, opinions, are, schools painting, high art, that; seen pictures Dresden Louvre, know taste sour krout. All I say is, do not know lanes woods fields. Though may choke-full science, one twenty knows find wood-sorrel, bee-orchis, grow next wood, three miles off, bog-bean wood-sage good for. And country legends, stories old gable-ended farmhouses, place last skirmish fought civil wars, parish butts stood, last highwayman turned bay, last ghost laid parson, they are gone date altogether. Now, time, got home old coach, put us cross-roads boxes, first day holidays, driven family coachman, singing “Dulce Domum” top voices, were, fixtures, till black Monday came round. We cut amusements within walk ride home. And got know country folk ways songs stories heart, went fields woods hills, again, till made friends all. We Berkshire, Gloucestershire, Yorkshire boys; you are young cosmopolites, belonging countries countries. No doubt it is right; I dare say is. This day large views, glorious humanity, that; I wish back-sword play had not gone Vale White Horse, confounded Great Western had not carried away Alfred's Hill make embankment. But return said Vale White Horse, country first scenes true interesting story laid. As I said, Great Western runs right it, land large, rich pastures bounded ox-fences, covered fine hedgerow timber, nice little gorse spinney, abideth poor Charley, cover betake miles miles, pushed fine November morning old Berkshire. Those there, well mounted, know he stanch little pack dash him--heads high sterns low, breast-high scent--can consume ground times. There little ploughland, woods, Vale average sporting country, except hunting. The villages straggling, queer, old-fashioned places, houses dropped without least regularity, nooks out-of-the-way corners, sides shadowy lanes footpaths, patch garden. They built chiefly good gray stone, thatched; though I see within last year two red-brick cottages multiplying, Vale beginning manufacture largely bricks tiles. There lots waste ground side roads every village, amounting often village greens, feed pigs ganders people; roads old-fashioned, homely roads, dirty badly made, hardly endurable winter, still pleasant jog-trot roads running great pasture-lands, dotted little clumps thorns, sleek kine feeding, fence either side them, gate end field, makes get gig (if keep one), gives chance looking every quarter mile. One moralists sat youth--was great Richard Swiveller, Mr. Stiggins--says, “We born vale, must take consequences found situation.” These consequences I, one, ready encounter. I pity people were not born vale. I do not mean flat country; vale--that is, flat country bounded hills. The hill always view choose turn towards him--that is essence vale. There he ever distance, friend companion. You never lose hilly districts. And hill White Horse Hill! There stands right rest, nine hundred feet sea, boldest, bravest shape chalk hill ever saw. Let us go top him, see found there. Ay, may well wonder think odd never heard before; wonder not, please, hundreds things lying England, wiser folk know nothing of, care nothing for. Yes, it is magnificent Roman camp, mistake, gates ditch mounds, complete twenty years strong old rogues left it. Here, right highest point, say see eleven counties, trenched round table-land, twelve fourteen acres, custom, could not bear anybody overlook them, made eyrie. The ground falls away rapidly sides. Was ever turf whole world? You sink ankles every step, yet spring delicious. There always breeze “camp,” called; lies, Romans left it, except cairn east side, left her Majesty's corps sappers miners day, engineer officer finished sojourn there, surveys ordnance map Berkshire. It altogether place will not forget, place open man's soul, make prophesy, he looks great Vale spread garden Lord him, wave wave mysterious downs behind, right left chalk hills running away distance, along he trace miles old Roman road, “the Ridgeway” (“the Rudge,” country folk call it), keeping straight along highest back hills--such place Balak brought Balaam to, told prophesy people valley beneath. And he could not, neither shall you, people Lord abide there. And leave camp, descend towards west, Ashdown. We treading heroes. It sacred ground Englishmen--more sacred one two fields bones lie whitening. For actual place Alfred his great battle, battle Ashdown (“Aescendum” chroniclers), broke Danish power, made England Christian land. The Danes held camp slope standing--the whole crown hill, fact. “The heathen beforehand seized higher ground,” old Asser says, wasted everything behind London, ready burst fair Vale, Alfred's birthplace heritage. And heights came Saxons, Alma. “The Christians led line lower ground. There stood also spot single thorn-tree, marvellous stumpy (which eyes seen).” Bless old chronicler! Does he think nobody ever saw “single thorn-tree” himself? Why, stands day, edge slope, I saw three weeks since--an old single thorn-tree, “marvellous stumpy.” At least, is not tree ought been, it is place battle must lost--“around which, I saying, two lines foemen came together battle huge shout. And place one two kings heathen five his earls fell died, many thousands heathen side place.” * After crowning mercy, pious king, might never wanting sign memorial country-side, carved northern side chalk hill, camp, almost precipitous, great Saxon White Horse, he may see railway, gives name Vale, looked thousand years more. * “Pagani editiorem Iocum praeoccupaverant. Christiani ab inferiori loco aciem dirigebant. Erat quoque eodem loco unica spinosa arbor, brevis admodum (quam nos ipsi nostris propriis oculis vidimus). Circa quam ergo hostiles inter se acies cum ingenti clamore hostiliter conveniunt. Quo loco alter de duobus Paganorum regibus et quinque comites occisi occubuerunt, et multa millia Paganae partis eodem loco. Cecidit illic ergo Boegsceg Rex, et Sidroc ille senex comes, et Sidroc Junior comes, et Obsbern comes,” etc.-- Annales Rerum Gestarum AElfredi Magni, Auctore Asserio. Recensuit Franciscus Wise. Oxford, 1722, p.23. Right White Horse curious deep broad gully called “the Manger,” one side hills fall series lovely sweeping curves, known “the Giant's Stairs.” They bit like stairs, I never saw anything like anywhere else, short green turf, tender bluebells, gossamer thistle-down gleaming sun sheep-paths running along sides like ruled lines. The side Manger formed Dragon's Hill, curious little round self-confident fellow, thrown forward range, utterly unlike everything round him. On hill deliverer mankind--St. George, country folk used tell me--killed dragon. Whether St. George, I cannot say; surely dragon killed there, may see marks yet his blood ran down, token place ran easiest way hillside. Passing along Ridgeway west mile, come little clump young beech firs, growth thorn privet underwood. Here may find nests strong partridge peewit, take care keeper is not upon you; middle old cromlech, huge flat stone raised seven eight others, led path, large single stones set side. This Wayland Smith's cave, place classic fame now; Sir Walter touched it, I may well let alone, refer “Kenilworth” legend. The thick, deep wood see hollow, mile off, surrounds Ashdown Park, built Inigo Jones. Four broad alleys cut wood circumference centre, leads one face house. The mystery downs hangs house wood, stand alone, unlike around, green slopes studded great stones part, stretching away sides. It wise Lord Craven, I think, pitched his tent there. Passing along Ridgeway east, soon come cultivated land. The downs, strictly called, more. Lincolnshire farmers imported, long, fresh slopes sheep-walks more, grow famous turnips barley. One improvers lives “Seven Barrows” farm, another mystery great downs. There barrows still, solemn silent, like ships calm sea, sepulchres sons men. But whom? It three miles White Horse--too far slain Ashdown buried there. Who shall say heroes waiting there? But must get Vale again, away Great Western Railway town, time printer's devil press, terrible long slippery descent, shocking bad road. At bottom, however, pleasant public; whereat must really take modest quencher, air provocative thirst. So pull old oak stands door. “What name hill, landlord?” “Blawing STWUN Hill, sir, sure.” [READER. “Stuym?” AUTHOR: “Stone, stupid--the Blowing Stone.”] “And house? I cannot make sign.” “Blawing Stwun, sir,” says landlord, pouring his old ale Toby Philpot jug, melodious crash, long-necked glass. “What queer names!” say we, sighing end draught, holding glass replenished. “Bean't queer all, I see, sir,” says mine host, handing back glass, “seeing Blawing Stwun, his self,” putting his hand square lump stone, three feet half high, perforated two three queer holes, like petrified antediluvian rat-holes, lies close oak, nose. We ever puzzled, drink second glass ale, wondering come next. “Like hear un, sir?” says mine host, setting Toby Philpot tray, resting hands “Stwun.” We ready anything; he, without waiting reply, applies his mouth one ratholes. Something must come it, he does not burst. Good heavens! I hope he apoplectic tendencies. Yes, comes, sure enough, gruesome sound moan roar, spreads away valley, hillside, woods back house, ghost-like, awful voice. “Um say, sir,” says mine host, rising purple-faced, moan still coming Stwun, “as used old times warn country-side blawing Stwun enemy a-comin', folks could make un heered seven mile round; leastways, I have heered Lawyer Smith say, he knows smart sight old times.” We hardly swallow Lawyer Smith's seven miles; could blowing stone summons, sort sending fiery cross round neighbourhood old times? What old times? Who knows? We pay beer, thankful. “And what is name village below, landlord?” “Kingstone Lisle, sir.” “Fine plantations you have got here?” “Yes, sir; Squire's 'mazing fond trees like.” “No wonder. He is got real beauties fond of. Good-day, landlord.” “Good-day, sir, pleasant ride 'ee.” And now, boys, I want get readers, enough? Will give once, say you are convinced, let begin story, it? Remember, I have little bit hillside yet--what could ride round easily ponies hour. I am come Vale, Blowing Stone Hill; I begin Vale, what is stop me? You will hear Wantage, birthplace Alfred, Farringdon, held long Charles First (the Vale near Oxford, dreadfully malignant--full Throgmortons, Puseys, Pyes, like; brawny retainers). Did ever read Thomas Ingoldsby's “Legend Hamilton Tighe”? If have not, ought have. Well, Farringdon he lived, he went sea; his real name Hamden Pye, Pyes great folk Farringdon. Then there is Pusey. You have heard Pusey horn, King Canute gave Puseys day, gallant old squire, lately gone his rest (whom Berkshire freeholders turned last Parliament, eternal disgrace, voting according his conscience), used bring high days, holidays, bonfire nights. And splendid old cross church Uffington, Uffingas town. How whole countryside teems Saxon names memories! And old moated grange Compton, nestled close hillside, twenty Marianas may lived, bright water-lilies moat, yew walk, “the cloister walk,” peerless terraced gardens. There are, twenty things beside, care them, eyes. And sort things may find, I believe, every one you, common English country neighbourhood. Will look noses, not? Well, well, I have done I make you; go gadding half Europe now, every holidays, I cannot help it. I born bred west-country man, thank God! Wessex man, citizen noblest Saxon kingdom Wessex, regular “Angular Saxon,” soul adscriptus glebae. There is nothing like old country-side me, music like twang real old Saxon tongue, one gets fresh veritable chaw White Horse Vale; I say “Gaarge Ridler,” old west-country yeoman,-- “Throo aall waarld owld Gaarge would bwoast, Commend merry owld England mwoast; While vools gwoes prating vur nigh, We stwops whum, dog I.” Here, rate, lived stopped home Squire Brown, J.P. county Berks, village near foot White Horse range. And he dealt justice mercy rough way, begat sons daughters, hunted fox, grumbled badness roads times. And his wife dealt stockings, calico shirts, smock frocks, comforting drinks old folks “rheumatiz,” good counsel all; kept coal clothes' clubs going, yule-tide, bands mummers came round, dressed ribbons coloured paper caps, stamped round Squire's kitchen, repeating true sing-song vernacular legend St. George his fight, ten-pound doctor, plays his part healing Saint--a relic, I believe, old Middle-age mysteries. It first dramatic representation greeted eyes little Tom, brought kitchen his nurse witness it, mature age three years. Tom eldest child his parents, his earliest babyhood exhibited family characteristics great strength. He hearty, strong boy first, given fighting escaping his nurse, fraternizing village boys, he made expeditions round neighbourhood. And here, quiet old-fashioned country village, shadow everlasting hills, Tom Brown reared, never left till he went first school, nearly eight years age, days change air twice year thought absolutely necessary health her Majesty's lieges. I credibly informed, inclined believe, various boards directors railway companies, gigantic jobbers bribers, quarrelling everything else, agreed together ten years back buy learned profession medicine, body soul. To end set apart several millions money, continually distribute judiciously among doctors, stipulating one thing, shall prescribe change air every patient pay, borrow money pay, railway fare, see prescription carried out. If this, none us well home year together? It was not twenty years ago, bit it. The Browns did not go country five years. A visit Reading Abingdon twice year, assizes quarter sessions, Squire made his horse pair saddle-bags containing his wardrobe, stay day two country neighbour's, expedition county ball yeomanry review, made sum Brown locomotion years. A stray Brown distant county dropped every then; Oxford, grave nag, old don, contemporary Squire; looked upon Brown household villagers sort feeling regard man crossed Rocky Mountains, launched boat Great Lake Central Africa. The White Horse Vale, remember, traversed great road--nothing country parish roads, bad. Only one coach ran there, one Wantage London, western part Vale without regular means moving on, certainly did not seem want them. There canal, way, supplied country-side coal, continually went long barges, big black men lounging side horses along towing-path, women bright-coloured handkerchiefs standing sterns steering. Standing I say, could never see whether standing sitting, heads shoulders sight cozy little cabins occupied eight feet stern, Tom Brown pictured desirable residences. His nurse told good-natured-looking women constant habit enticing children barges, taking London selling them, Tom would not believe, made resolve soon possible accept oft-proffered invitation sirens “young master” come ride. But yet nurse much Tom. Yet I, all, abuse gadabout propensities countrymen? We vagabond nation now, that is certain, better worse. I vagabond; I away home less five distinct times last year. The Queen sets us example: moving top bottom. Little dirty Jack, abides Clement's Inn gateway, blacks boots penny, takes his month's hop-picking every year matter course. Why should not he? I am delighted it. I love vagabonds, I prefer poor rich ones. Couriers ladies'-maids, imperials travelling carriages, abomination unto me; I cannot away them. But dirty Jack, every good fellow who, words capital French song, moves about, “Comme le limacon, Portant tout son bagage, Ses meubles, sa maison,” his back, why, good luck them, many merry roadside adventure, steaming supper chimney corners roadside inns, Swiss chalets, Hottentot kraals, wherever else like go. So, succeeded contradicting first chapter (which gives great hopes go on, think good fellow notwithstanding crotchets), I shall shut present, consider ways; resolved “sar' out,” say Vale, “holus bolus” comes, you will probably get truth me. CHAPTER II--THE “VEAST.” “And King commandeth forbiddeth, henceforth neither fairs markets kept Churchyards, honour Church.”--STATUTES : 13 Edw. I. Stat. II. cap. vi. As venerable learned poet (whose voluminous works think correct thing admire talk about, do not read often) truly says, “The child father man;” fortiori, therefore, he must father boy. So going rate see Tom Brown his boyhood, supposing never get farther (which, show proper sense value history, knowing may), let us look life environments child quiet country village introduced last chapter. Tom, already said, robust combative urchin, age four began struggle yoke authority his nurse. That functionary good-hearted, tearful, scatter-brained girl, lately taken Tom's mother, Madam Brown, she called, village school trained nurserymaid. Madam Brown rare trainer servants, spent herself freely profession; profession was, gave her trouble half many people take earn good income. Her servants known sought miles round. Almost girls attained certain place village school taken her, one two time, housemaids, laundrymaids, nurserymaids, kitchenmaids, year two's training started life amongst neighbouring families, good principles wardrobes. One results system perpetual despair Mrs. Brown's cook maid, sooner notable girl made hands missus sure find good place her send her off, taking fresh importations school. Another was, house always full young girls, clean, shining faces, broke plates scorched linen, made atmosphere cheerful, homely life place, good every one came within influence. Mrs. Brown loved young people, fact human creatures general, plates linen. They like lot elder children servants, felt her mother aunt mistress. Tom's nurse one took her instruction slowly--she seemed two left hands head; Mrs. Brown kept her longer usual, she might expend her awkwardness forgetfulness upon would judge punish her strictly them. Charity Lamb her name. It immemorial habit village christen children either Bible names, cardinal virtues; one ever hearing village street green, shrill sounds “Prudence! Prudence! thee cum' gutter;” or, “Mercy! drat girl, bist thee a-doing wi' little Faith?” Ruths, Rachels, Keziahs, every corner. The boys: Benjamins, Jacobs, Noahs, Enochs. I suppose custom come Puritan times. There is, rate, strong still Vale. Well, early morning till dewy eve, she cold tub putting bed, Charity Tom pitted one another. Physical power yet side Charity, she had not chance wherever headwork wanted. This war independence began every morning breakfast, Charity escorted her charge neighbouring farmhouse, supplied Browns, where, his mother's wish, Master Tom went drink whey breakfast. Tom sort objection whey, he decided liking curds, forbidden unwholesome; seldom morning he manage secure handful hard curds, defiance Charity farmer's wife. The latter good soul gaunt, angular woman, who, old black bonnet top her head, strings dangling her shoulders, her gown tucked her pocket-holes, went clattering dairy, cheese-room, yard, high pattens. Charity sort niece old lady's, consequently free farmhouse garden, she could resist going purposes gossip flirtation heir-apparent, dawdling fellow, never work he ought been. The moment Charity found her cousin, occupation, Tom would slip away; minute shrill cries would heard dairy, “Charity, Charity, thee lazy huzzy, bist?” Tom would break cover, hands mouth full curds, take refuge shaky surface great muck reservoir middle yard, disturbing repose great pigs. Here he safety, grown person could follow without getting knees; luckless Charity, her aunt scolded her dairy door, “allus hankering arter Willum, instead minding Master Tom,” would descend threats coaxing, lure Tom muck, rising his shoes, would soon tell tale his stockings, she would sure catch missus's maid. Tom two abettors, shape couple old boys, Noah Benjamin name, defended Charity, expended much time upon his education. They retired servants former generations Browns. Noah Crooke keen, dry old man almost ninety, still able totter about. He talked Tom quite he one his family, indeed long completely identified Browns himself. In remote age he attendant Miss Brown, conveyed her country pillion. He little round picture identical gray horse, caparisoned identical pillion, he used sort fetish worship, abuse turnpike-roads carriages. He wore old full-bottomed wig, gift dandy old Brown he valeted middle last century, habiliment Master Tom looked upon considerable respect, say fear; indeed his whole feeling towards Noah strongly tainted awe. And old gentleman gathered his fathers, Tom's lamentation unaccompanied certain joy seen last wig. “Poor old Noah, dead gone,” said he; “Tom Brown sorry. Put coffin, wig all.” But old Benjy young master's real delight refuge. He youth side Noah, scarce seventy years old--a cheery, humorous, kind-hearted old man, full sixty years Vale gossip, sorts helpful ways young old, children. It he bent first pin Tom extracted his first stickleback “Pebbly Brook,” little stream ran village. The first stickleback splendid fellow, fabulous red blue gills. Tom kept small basin till day his death, became fisherman day. Within month taking first stickleback, Benjy carried hero canal, defiance Charity; them, whole afternoon's popjoying, caught three four small, coarse fish perch, averaging perhaps two half ounces each, Tom bore home rapture his mother precious gift, she received like true mother equal rapture, instructing cook nevertheless, private interview, prepare Squire's dinner. Charity appealed old Benjy meantime, representing dangers canal banks; Mrs. Brown, seeing boy's inaptitude female guidance, decided Benjy's favour, thenceforth old man Tom's dry nurse. And sat canal watching little green-and-white float, Benjy would instruct doings deceased Browns. How his grandfather, early days great war, much distress crime Vale, magistrates threatened mob, ridden big stick his hand, held petty sessions himself. How his great-uncle, rector, encountered laid last ghost, frightened old women, male female, parish senses, turned blacksmith's apprentice disguised drink white sheet. It Benjy, too, saddled Tom's first pony, instructed mysteries horsemanship, teaching throw his weight back keep his hand low, stood chuckling outside door girls' school Tom rode his little Shetland cottage round table, old dame her pupils seated work. Benjy come family distinguished Vale prowess athletic games. Some half-dozen his brothers kinsmen gone wars, one survived come home, small pension, three bullets different parts his body; he shared Benjy's cottage till his death, left his old dragoon's sword pistol, hung mantelpiece, flanked pair heavy single-sticks Benjy renown long ago old gamester, picked men Wiltshire Somersetshire, many good bout revels pastimes country-side. For he famous back-swordman his young days, good wrestler elbow collar. Back-swording wrestling serious holiday pursuits Vale--those men attained fame--and village champion. I suppose that, whole, people less worked now; rate, seemed time energy old pastimes. The great times back-swording came round year village; feast. The Vale “veasts” common statute feasts, much ancient business. They literally, far one ascertain, feasts dedication--that is, first established churchyard day village church opened public worship, wake festival patron saint, held day every year since time. There longer remembrance “veast” instituted, nevertheless pleasant almost sacred character own; children village, wherever scattered, tried get home holiday visit fathers mothers friends, bringing wages little gift country old folk. Perhaps day two before, rate “veast day” day after, village, might see strapping, healthy young men women parts country going round house house best clothes, finishing call Madam Brown, would consult putting earnings best advantage, best expend benefit old folk. Every household, however poor, managed raise “feast-cake” bottle ginger raisin wine, stood cottage table ready comers, unlikely make remember feast-time, feast-cake solid, full huge raisins. Moreover, feast-time day reconciliation parish. If Job Higgins Noah Freeman had not spoken last six months, “old women” would sure get patched day. And though good deal drinking low vice booths evening, pretty well confined would like, “veast veast;” whole, effect humanising Christian. In fact, reason case still gentlefolk farmers taken amusements, have, usual, forgotten poor. They do not attend feasts themselves, call disreputable; whereupon steadiest poor leave also, become called. Class amusements, dukes ploughboys, always become nuisances curses country. The true charm cricket hunting still less sociable universal; there is place every man come take his part. No one village enjoyed approach “veast day” Tom, year he taken old Benjy's tutelage. The feast held large green field lower end village. The road Farringdon ran along one side it, brook side road; brook another large, gentle, sloping pasture-land, footpath running churchyard; old church, originator mirth, towered gray walls lancet windows, overlooking sanctioning whole, though share therein forgotten. At point footpath crossed brook road, entered field feast held, long, low roadside inn; opposite side field large white thatched farmhouse, dwelt old sporting farmer, great promoter revels. Past old church, footpath, pottered old man child hand-in-hand early afternoon day feast, wandered round ground, already occupied “cheap Jacks,” green-covered carts marvellous assortment wares; booths legitimate small traders, tempting arrays fairings eatables; penny peep-shows shows, containing pink-eyed ladies, dwarfs, boa-constrictors, wild Indians. But object interest Benjy, course his pupil also, stage rough planks four feet high, put village carpenter back-swording wrestling. And surveying whole tenderly, old Benjy led his charge away roadside inn, he ordered glass ale long pipe himself, discussed unwonted luxuries bench outside soft autumn evening mine host, another old servant Browns, speculated likelihood good show old gamesters contend morrow's prizes, told tales gallant bouts forty years back, Tom listened his ears eyes. But shall tell joy next morning, church bells ringing merry peal, old Benjy appeared servants' hall, resplendent long blue coat brass buttons, pair old yellow buckskins top-boots he cleaned inherited Tom's grandfather, stout thorn stick his hand, nosegay pinks lavender his buttonhole, led away Tom his best clothes, two new shillings his breeches-pockets? Those two, rate, look like enjoying day's revel. They quicken pace get churchyard, already see field thronged country folk; men clean, white smocks velveteen fustian coats, rough plush waistcoats many colours, women beautiful, long scarlet cloak--the usual out-door dress west-country women days, often descended families mother daughter--or new-fashioned stuff shawls, which, would believe it, do not become half well. The air resounds pipe tabor, drums trumpets showmen shouting doors caravans, tremendous pictures wonders seen within hang temptingly; rises shrill “root-too-too-too” Mr. Punch, unceasing pan-pipe his satellite. “Lawk a' massey, Mr. Benjamin,” cries stout, motherly woman red cloak, enter field, “be you? Well, I never! You look purely. And how is Squire, madam, family?” Benjy graciously shakes hands speaker, left village years, come “veast” day visit old gossip, gently indicates heir-apparent Browns. “Bless his little heart! I must gi' un kiss.--Here, Susannah, Susannah!” cries she, raising herself embrace, “come see Mr. Benjamin young Master Tom.--You minds Sukey, Mr. Benjamin; she growed rare slip wench since seen her, though her'll sixteen come Martinmas. I aim take her see madam get her place.” And Sukey comes bouncing away knot old school-fellows, drops curtsey Mr. Benjamin. And elders come parts salute Benjy, girls madam's pupils kiss Master Tom. And carry load fairings; he returns Benjy, his hat coat covered ribbons, his pockets crammed wonderful boxes open upon ever new boxes, popguns, trumpets, apples, gilt gingerbread stall Angel Heavens, sole vender thereof, whose booth groans kings queens, elephants prancing steeds, gleaming gold. There gold Angel's cakes ginger degenerate age. Skilled diggers might yet make fortune churchyards Vale, carefully washing dust consumers Angel's gingerbread. Alas! he his namesakes, his receipts have, I fear, died him. And inspect penny peep-show--at least Tom does--while old Benjy stands outside gossips walks steps, enters mysterious doors pink-eyed lady Irish giant, means come pictures; boa swallow his rabbit, rabbit waiting swallowed; expect tuppence? We easily pleased Vale. Now rush crowd, tinkling bell heard, shouts laughter; Master Tom mounts Benjy's shoulders, beholds jingling match glory. The games begun, opening them. It quaint game, immensely amusing look at; I do not know whether used counties, I better describe it. A large roped ring made, introduced dozen big boys young men mean play; carefully blinded turned loose ring, man introduced blindfolded; bell hung round his neck, his two hands tied behind him. Of course every time he moves bell must ring, he hand hold it; dozen blindfolded men catch him. This cannot always manage he lively fellow, half always rush arms half, drive heads together, tumble over; crowd laughs vehemently, invents nicknames spur moment; they, choleric, tear handkerchiefs blind them, unfrequently pitch one another, thinking must run purpose. It great fun look jingling match certainly, Tom shouts jumps old Benjy's shoulders sight, old man feels weary, shifts strong young shoulders groom, got fun. And now, climbing pole another part field, muzzling flour-tub another, old farmer whose house, said, overlooks field, master revels, gets steps stage, announces may concern half-sovereign money forthcoming old gamester breaks heads; Squire he added new hat. The amount prize sufficient stimulate men immediate neighbourhood, enough bring high talent distance; so, glance two round, tall fellow, shepherd, chucks his hat stage climbs steps, looking rather sheepish. The crowd, course, first cheer, chaff usual, he picks his hat begins handling sticks see suit him. “Wooy, Willum Smith, thee canst plaay wi' he arra daay,” says his companion blacksmith's apprentice, stout young fellow nineteen twenty. Willum's sweetheart “veast” somewhere, strictly enjoined get his head broke back-swording, pain her highest displeasure; she seen (the women pretend like see backsword play, keep away stage), his hat decidedly getting old, he chucks stage, follows himself, hoping he break people's heads, that, all, Rachel will not really mind. Then follows greasy cap lined fur half-gipsy, poaching, loafing fellow, travels Vale much good, I fancy: “For twenty times Peter feared For Peter respected,” fact. And three four hats, including glossy castor Joe Willis, self-elected would-be champion neighbourhood, well-to-do young butcher twenty-eight thereabouts, great strapping fellow, his full allowance bluster. This capital show gamesters, considering amount prize; so, picking sticks drawing lots, I think I must tell you, shortly I can, noble old game back-sword played; sadly gone late, even Vale, maybe never seen it. The weapon good stout ash stick large basket handle, heavier somewhat shorter common single-stick. The players called “old gamesters”--why, I cannot tell you--and object simply break one another's heads; moment blood runs inch anywhere eyebrow, old gamester belongs beaten, stop. A slight blow sticks fetch blood, means punishing pastime, men do not play purpose savagely body arms adversaries. The old gamester going action takes his hat coat, arms stick; he loops fingers his left hand handkerchief strap, he fastens round his left leg, measuring length, he draws tight his left elbow air, elbow shall reach high his crown. Thus see, long he chooses keep his left elbow up, regardless cuts, he perfect guard left side his head. Then he advances his right hand front his head, holding his stick across, point projects inch two his left elbow; thus his whole head completely guarded, he faces his man armed like manner; stand three feet apart, often nearer, feint, strike, return one another's heads, one cries “hold,” blood flows. In first case allowed minute's time; go again; latter another pair gamesters called on. If good men playing, quickness returns marvellous: hear rattle like boy makes drawing his stick along palings, heavier; closeness men action one another gives strange interest, makes spell back-swording noble sight. They suited sticks, Joe Willis gipsy man drawn first lot. So rest lean rails stage, Joe dark man meet middle, boards strewed sawdust, Joe's white shirt spotless drab breeches boots contrasting gipsy's coarse blue shirt dirty green velveteen breeches leather gaiters. Joe evidently turning his nose other, half insulted break his head. The gipsy tough, active fellow, skilful his weapon, Joe's weight strength tell minute; he heavy metal him. Whack, whack, whack, come his blows, breaking gipsy's guard, threatening reach his head every moment. There last. “Blood, blood!” shout spectators, thin stream oozes slowly roots his hair, umpire calls stop. The gipsy scowls Joe his brows pleasant manner, Master Joe swaggers about, makes attitudes, thinks himself, shows he thinks himself, greatest man field. Then follow several stout sets-to candidates new hat, last come shepherd Willum Smith. This crack set-to day. They famous wind, crying “hold.” The shepherd old hand, dodges. He tries one another, nearly gets Willum's head coming near, playing his guard half-stick; somehow Willum blunders through, catching stick his shoulders, neck, sides, every then, anywhere his head, his returns heavy straight, he youngest gamester favourite parish, his gallant stand brings shouts cheers, knowing ones think he will win he keeps steady; Tom, groom's shoulder, holds his hands together, hardly breathe excitement. Alas Willum! His sweetheart, getting tired female companionship, hunting booths see he got to, catches sight stage full combat. She flushes turns pale; her old aunt catches hold her, saying, “Bless 'ee, child, doan't 'ee go a'nigst it;” she breaks away runs towards stage calling his name. Willum keeps his guard stoutly, glances moment towards voice. No guard it, Willum, without eye. The shepherd steps round strikes, point his stick grazes Willum's forehead, fetching skin, blood flows, umpire cries, “Hold!” poor Willum's chance day. But he takes well, puts his old hat coat, goes scolded his sweetheart, led away mischief. Tom hears say coaxingly, he walks off,-- “Now doan't 'ee, Rachel! I would not ha' done it, I wanted summut buy 'ee fairing wi', I vlush money twod feathers.” “Thee mind I tells 'ee,” rejoins Rachel saucily, “and doan't 'ee kep blethering fairings.” Tom resolves his heart give Willum remainder his two shillings back-swording. Joe Willis luck to-day. His next bout ends easy victory, shepherd tough job break his second head; Joe shepherd meet, whole circle expect hope see get broken crown, shepherd slips first round falls rails, hurting old farmer let go on, much he wishes try; impostor Joe (for he certainly best man) struts swaggers stage conquering gamester, though he has not five minutes' really trying play. Joe takes new hat his hand, puts money it, then, thought strikes him, he does not think his victory quite acknowledged below, walks face stage, looks down, shaking money, chaffing, he will stake hat money another half-sovereign “agin gamester has not played already.” Cunning Joe! he thus gets rid Willum shepherd, quite fresh again. No one seems like offer, umpire coming down, queer old hat, something like doctor divinity's shovel, chucked stage elderly, quiet man steps out, watching play, saying he like cross stick wi' prodigalish young chap. The crowd cheer, begin chaff Joe, turns his nose swaggers across sticks. “Imp'dent old wosbird!” says he; “I will break bald head un truth.” The old boy bald, certainly, blood show fast enough touch him, Joe. He takes his long-flapped coat, stands long-flapped waistcoat, Sir Roger de Coverley might worn new, picks stick, ready Master Joe, loses time, begins his old game, whack, whack, whack, trying break old man's guard sheer strength. But will not do; he catches every blow close basket, though he rather stiff his returns, minute walks Joe stage, clearly stanch old gamester. Joe comes in, making his height, tries get old man's guard half-stick, he takes smart blow ribs another elbow, nothing more. And he loses wind begins puff, crowd laugh. “Cry 'hold,' Joe; thee'st met thy match!” Instead taking good advice getting his wind, Joe loses his temper, strikes old man's body. “Blood, blood!” shout crowd; “Joe's head's broke!” Who would thought it? How come? That body-blow left Joe's head unguarded moment; one turn wrist old gentleman picked neat little bit skin middle his forehead; though he will not believe it, hammers three blows despite shouts, convinced blood trickling his eye. Poor Joe sadly crestfallen, fumbles his pocket half-sovereign, old gamester will not it. “Keep thy money, man, gi's thy hand,” says he; shake hands. But old gamester gives new hat shepherd, and, soon after, half-sovereign Willum, thereout decorates his sweetheart ribbons his heart's content. “Who be?” “Wur cum from?” ask crowd. And soon flies old west-country champion, played tie Shaw Lifeguardsman “Vizes” twenty years before, broken Joe Willis's crown him. How country fair spinning out! I see I must skip wrestling; boys jumping sacks, rolling wheelbarrows blindfolded; donkey-race, fight arose thereout, marring otherwise peaceful “veast;” frightened scurrying away female feast-goers, descent Squire Brown, summoned wife one combatants stop it; he would not start till he got his top-boots. Tom carried away old Benjy, dog-tired surfeited pleasure, evening comes dancing begins booths; though Willum, Rachel her new ribbons, many another good lad lass do not come away yet, good step out, enjoy it, get harm thereby, yet we, sober folk, stroll away churchyard, old yew-tree, get quiet dish tea parley gossips, steady ones village do, bed. That is fair, true sketch, far goes, one larger village feasts Vale Berks, I little boy. They much altered worse, I told. I have not one twenty years, I statute fairs west-country towns, servants hired, greater abominations cannot found. What village feasts come to, I fear, many cases, may read pages “Yeast” (though I never saw one bad--thank God!). Do want know why? It because, I said before, gentlefolk farmers left joining taking interest them. They do not either subscribe prizes, go enjoy fun. Is good bad sign? I hardly know. Bad, sure enough, arises separation classes consequent twenty years buying cheap selling dear, accompanying overwork; sons daughters hearts London club-life, so-called “society,” instead old English home-duties; farmers' sons apeing fine gentlemen, farmers' daughters caring make bad foreign music good English cheeses. Good, perhaps, time old “veast” gone by; longer healthy, sound expression English country holiday-making; that, fact, we, nation, got beyond it, transition state, feeling soon likely find better substitute. Only I got say I quit text. Do not let reformers sort think going really lay hold working boys young men England educational grapnel whatever, is not bona fide equivalent games old country “veast” it; something put place back-swording wrestling racing; something try muscles men's bodies, endurance hearts, make rejoice strength. In new-fangled comprehensive plans I see, left out; consequence is, great mechanics' institutes end intellectual priggism, Christian young men's societies religious Pharisaism. Well, well, must bide time. Life is not beer skittles; beer skittles, something better sort, must form good part every Englishman's education. If I could drive heads rising parliamentary lords, young swells “have ways made you,” saying is, you, frequent palaver houses West-end clubs, waiting always ready strap back poor dear old John, soon present used-up lot (your fathers uncles), sit great parliamentary-majorities' pack-saddle, make believe they are guiding red-tape bridle, tumble, lifted off! I do not think much yet--I wish I could--though go talking lecturing country crowded audiences, busy sorts philanthropic intellectualism, circulating libraries museums, Heaven knows besides, try make us think, newspaper reports, are, even we, working classes. But bless hearts, “are not green,” though lots us sorts toady enough certainly, try make think so. I will tell now: instead trumpeting fuss, old parliamentary-majority dodge again, go, (you have plenty time it, you will give t'other line), quietly make three four friends--real friends--among us. You will find little trouble getting right sort, birds do not come lightly lure; found may be. Take, say, two professions, lawyer, parson, doctor--which will; one trade; three four working classes--tailors, engineers, carpenters, engravers. There is plenty choice. Let men ages, mind, ask homes; introduce wives sisters, get introduced theirs; give good dinners, talk really bottom hearts; box, run, row them, chance. Do honestly man man, time come ride old John, you will able something sit his back, may feel his mouth stronger bridle red-tape one. Ah, would! But got far right rut, I fear. Too much over-civilization, deceitfulness riches. It easier camel go eye needle. More's pity. I never came across two could value man wholly solely him--who thought verily indeed flesh blood John Jones attorney's clerk, Bill Smith costermonger, could act thought so. CHAPTER III--SUNDRY WARS AND ALLIANCES. Poor old Benjy! The “rheumatiz” much answer English country-sides, never played scurvier trick laying thee heels, thou wast yet green old age. The enemy, long carrying sort border warfare, trying his strength Benjy's battlefield his hands legs, now, mustering his forces, began laying siege citadel, overrunning whole country. Benjy seized back loins; though he made strong brave fight, soon clear enough could beaten poor old Benjy would give long. It much he could now, help his big stick frequent stops, hobble canal Master Tom, bait his hook him, sit watch his angling, telling quaint old country stories; Tom sport, detecting rat hundred yards along bank, would rush Toby turnspit terrier, his faithful companion, bootless pursuit, he might tumbled drowned twenty times Benjy could got near him. Cheery unmindful himself, Benjy was, loss locomotive power bothered greatly. He got new object his old age, beginning think useful world. He feared much, too, lest Master Tom fall back hands Charity women. So he tried everything he could think get set up. He even went expedition dwelling one queer mortals, who--say will, reason will--do cure simple people diseases one kind another without aid physic, get reputation using charms, inspire dwellings great respect, say fear, amongst simple folk dwellers Vale White Horse. Where power, whatever else may be, descends upon shoulders man whose ways straight, he becomes nuisance neighbourhood--a receiver stolen goods, giver love-potions, deceiver silly women--the avowed enemy law order, justices peace, head-boroughs, gamekeepers,--such man, fact, recently caught tripping, deservedly dealt Leeds justices, seducing girl come get back faithless lover, convicted bigamy since then. Sometimes, however, quite different stamp--men pretend nothing, difficulty persuaded exercise occult arts simplest cases. Of latter sort old Farmer Ives, he called, “wise man” Benjy resorted (taking Tom usual), early spring year next feast described last chapter. Why he called “farmer” I cannot say, unless he owner cow, pig two, poultry, he maintained acre land inclosed middle wild common, probably his father squatted lords manors looked keenly rights now. Here he lived one knew long, solitary man. It often rumoured he turned his cottage pulled down, somehow never came pass; his pigs cow went grazing common, his geese hissed passing children heels horse lord's steward, often rode covetous eye inclosure still unmolested. His dwelling miles village; Benjy, half ashamed his errand, wholly unable walk there, exercise much ingenuity get means transporting Tom thither without exciting suspicion. However, one fine May morning he managed borrow old blind pony friend publican, Tom persuaded Madam Brown give holiday spend old Benjy, lend Squire's light cart, stored bread cold meat bottle ale. And two high glee started behind old Dobbin, jogged along deep-rutted plashy roads, mended winter's wear, towards dwelling wizard. About noon passed gate opened large common, old Dobbin toiled slowly hill, Benjy pointed little deep dingle left, welled tiny stream. As crept hill tops birch-trees came sight, blue smoke curling delicate light boughs; little white thatched home inclosed ground Farmer Ives, lying cradled dingle, gay gorse common rising behind sides; front, traversing gentle slope, eye might travel miles miles rich vale. They left main road struck green track common marked lightly wheel horse-shoe, led dingle stopped rough gate Farmer Ives. Here found farmer, iron-gray old man, bushy eyebrow strong aquiline nose, busied one his vocations. He horse cow doctor, tending sick beast sent cured. Benjy hailed old friend, he returned greeting cordially enough, looking however hard moment Benjy Tom, see whether visit appeared first sight. It work difficulty danger Benjy reach ground, which, however, he managed without mishap; he devoted unharnessing Dobbin turning graze (“a run” one could say virtuous steed) common. This done, he extricated cold provisions cart, entered farmer's wicket; he, shutting knife he taking maggots cow's back sides, accompanied towards cottage. A big old lurcher got slowly door-stone, stretching first one hind leg other, taking Tom's caresses presence Toby, kept, however, respectful distance, equal indifference. “Us cum pay 'ee visit. I have long minded do't old sake's sake, I vinds I dwon't get I would used to't. I plaguy bad wi' th' rheumatiz back.” Benjy paused, hopes drawing farmer subject his ailments without direct application. “Ah, I see bean't quite lissom was,” replied farmer, grim smile, he lifted latch his door; “we bean't young was, nother us, wuss luck.” The farmer's cottage like better class peasantry general. A snug chimney corner two seats, small carpet hearth, old flint gun pair spurs fireplace, dresser shelves bright pewter plates crockeryware arranged, old walnut table, chairs settles, framed samplers, old print two, bookcase dozen volumes walls, rack flitches bacon, stores fastened ceiling, best part furniture. No sign occult art seen, unless bundles dried herbs hanging rack ingle row labelled phials one shelves betoken it. Tom played kittens occupied hearth, goat walked demurely open door--while host Benjy spread table dinner--and soon engaged conflict cold meat, he much honour. The two old men's talk old comrades deeds, mute inglorious Miltons Vale, doings thirty years back, did not interest much, except spoke making canal; indeed he began listen his ears, learned, his small wonder, his dear wonderful canal always--was not, fact, old Benjy Farmer Ives, caused strange commotion his small brain. After dinner Benjy called attention wart Tom knuckles his hand, family doctor trying his skill without success, begged farmer charm away. Farmer Ives looked it, muttered something another it, cut notches short stick, he handed Benjy, giving instructions cutting certain days, cautioning Tom meddle wart fortnight. And strolled sat bench sun pipes, pigs came grunted sociably let Tom scratch them; farmer, seeing he liked animals, stood held his arms air, gave call, brought flock pigeons wheeling dashing birch-trees. They settled clusters farmer's arms shoulders, making love scrambling one another's backs get his face; he threw off, fluttered close by, lighted he held his arms. All creatures place clean fearless, quite unlike relations elsewhere; Tom begged taught make pigs cows poultry village tame, farmer gave one his grim chuckles. It was not till ready go, old Dobbin harnessed, Benjy broached subject his rheumatism again, detailing his symptoms one one. Poor old boy! He hoped farmer could charm away easily he could Tom's wart, ready equal faith put another notched stick his pocket, cure his ailments. The physician shook his head, nevertheless produced bottle, handed Benjy, instructions use. “Not 't'll 'ee much good--leastways I afeard not,” shading his eyes his hand, looking cart. “There is one thing I knows as'll cure old folks like I th' rheumatiz.” “Wot then, farmer?” inquired Benjy. “Churchyard mould,” said old iron-gray man, another chuckle. And said good-byes went ways home. Tom's wart gone fortnight, Benjy's rheumatism, laid heels more. And though Tom still spent many hour him, he sat bench sunshine, chimney corner cold, he soon seek elsewhere his regular companions. Tom accustomed often accompany his mother her visits cottages, thereby made acquaintance many village boys his age. There Job Rudkin, son widow Rudkin, bustling woman parish. How she could ever stolid boy Job child must always remain mystery. The first time Tom went cottage his mother, Job indoors; he entered soon after, stood hands his pockets, staring Tom. Widow Rudkin, would cross madam get young Hopeful--a breach good manners she wholly incapable--began series pantomime signs, puzzled him; last, unable contain herself longer, burst with, “Job! Job! where is thy cap?” “What! bean't 'ee head, mother?” replied Job, slowly extricating one hand pocket, feeling article question; he found his head sure enough, left there, his mother's horror Tom's great delight. Then poor Jacob Dodson, half-witted boy, ambled cheerfully, undertaking messages little helpful odds ends every one, which, however, poor Jacob managed always hopelessly imbrangle. Everything came pieces his hands, nothing would stop his head. They nicknamed Jacob Doodle-calf. But Harry Winburn, quickest best boy parish. He might year older Tom, little bigger, he Crichton village boys. He could wrestle climb run better rest, learned schoolmaster could teach faster worthy liked. He boy proud of, his curly brown hair, keen gray eye, straight active figure, little ears hands feet, “as fine lord's,” Charity remarked Tom one day, talking, usual, great nonsense. Lords' hands ears feet ugly folk's children, one may convince he likes look. Tight boots gloves, nothing them, I allow make difference time twenty. Now Benjy laid shelf, his young brothers still petticoat government, Tom, search companions, began cultivate village boys generally more. Squire Brown, said, true-blue Tory backbone, believed honestly powers ordained God, loyalty steadfast obedience men's first duties. Whether consequence spite his political creed, I mean give opinion, though I one; certain he held therewith divers social principles generally supposed true blue colour. Foremost these, one Squire loved propound others, belief man valued wholly solely he himself, stands four fleshly walls him, apart clothes, rank, fortune, externals whatsoever. Which belief I take wholesome corrective political opinions, and, held sincerely, make opinions equally harmless, whether blue, red, green. As necessary corollary belief, Squire Brown held did not matter straw whether his son associated lords' sons ploughmen's sons, provided brave honest. He played football gone bird-nesting farmers he met vestry labourers tilled fields, his father grandfather, progenitors. So he encouraged Tom his intimacy boys village, forwarded means his power, gave run close playground, provided bats balls football sports. Our village blessed amongst things well-endowed school. The building stood itself, apart master's house, angle ground three roads met--an old gray stone building steep roof mullioned windows. On one opposite angles stood Squire Brown's stables kennel, backs road, towered great elm-tree; third stood village carpenter wheelwright's large open shop, his house schoolmaster's, long low eaves, swallows built scores. The moment Tom's lessons over, he would get corner stables, watch till boys came school. He prevailed groom cut notches bark elm he could climb lower branches; he would sit watching school door, speculating possibility turning elm dwelling-place friends, manner Swiss Family Robinson. But school hours long Tom's patience short, he soon began descend street, go peep school door wheelwright's shop, look something away time. Now wheelwright choleric man, one fine afternoon, returning short absence, found Tom occupied one his pet adzes, edge fast vanishing hero's care. A speedy flight saved Tom one sound cuff ears; he resented unjustifiable interruption his first essays carpentering, still proceedings wheelwright, cut switch, hung door his workshop, threatening use upon Tom he came within twenty yards his gate. So Tom, retaliate, commenced war upon swallows dwelt wheelwright's eaves, he harassed sticks stones; fleeter foot his enemy, escaped punishment, kept perpetual anger. Moreover, his presence school door began incense master, boys neighbourhood neglected lessons consequence; he issued porch, rod hand, Tom beat hasty retreat. And he wheelwright, laying heads together, resolved acquaint Squire Tom's afternoon occupations; order effect, determined take captive lead away judgment fresh his evil doings. This would found difficulty doing, Tom continued war single-handed, rather single-footed, he would taken deepest part Pebbly Brook escape them; but, like active powers, he ruined his alliances. Poor Jacob Doodle-calf could go school boys, one fine afternoon, three of the clock (the school broke four), Tom found ambling street, pressed visit school-porch. Jacob, always ready he asked, consented, two stole school together. Tom first reconnoitred wheelwright's shop; seeing signs activity, thought safe quarter, ordered advance his troops upon schoolporch. The door school ajar, boys seated nearest bench recognized opened correspondence invaders. Tom, waxing bold, kept putting his head school making faces master his back turned. Poor Jacob, least comprehending situation, high glee finding near school, he never allowed enter, suddenly, fit enthusiasm, pushed Tom, ambling three steps school, stood there, looking round nodding self-approving smile. The master, stooping boy's slate, his back door, became aware something unusual, turned quickly round. Tom rushed Jacob, began dragging back his smock-frock, master made them, scattering forms boys his career. Even might escaped, porch, barring retreat, appeared crafty wheelwright, watching proceedings. So seized, school dismissed, Tom Jacob led away Squire Brown lawful prize, boys following gate groups, speculating result. The Squire angry first, interview, Tom's pleading, ended compromise. Tom go near school till three of the clock, he done his lessons well, case he bearer note master Squire Brown; master agreed case release ten twelve best boys hour time breaking up, go play close. The wheelwright's adzes swallows ever respected; hero master withdrew servants' hall drink Squire's health, well satisfied day's work. The second act Tom's life may said begun. The war independence time: none women now--not even his mother's maid--dared offer help dressing washing. Between ourselves, he often first run Benjy unfinished state toilet. Charity rest seemed take delight putting impossible buttons ties middle his back; he would gone without nether integuments altogether, sooner recourse female valeting. He room himself, his father gave sixpence week pocket-money. All he achieved Benjy's advice assistance. But he conquered another step life--the step real boys long make: he got amongst his equals age strength, could measure boys; he lived whose pursuits wishes ways kind his own. The little governess lately installed house found her work grow wondrously easy, Tom slaved his lessons, order make sure his note schoolmaster. So days week Tom village boys playing close three of the clock. Prisoner's base, rounders, high-cock-a-lorum, cricket, football--he soon initiated delights all; though boys older himself, he managed hold his well. He naturally active strong, quick eye hand, advantage light shoes well-fitting dress, short time he could run jump climb them. They generally finished regular games half hour tea-time, began trials skill strength many ways. Some would catch Shetland pony turned field, get two three together his back, little rogue, enjoying fun, would gallop fifty yards, turn round, stop short shoot turf, graze quietly till he felt another load; others played peg-top marbles, bigger ones stood bout wrestling. Tom first looked pastime, peculiar attractions him, he could long keep it. Elbow collar wrestling, practised western counties, was, next back-swording, way fame youth Vale; boys knew rules it, less expert. But Job Rudkin Harry Winburn stars--the former stiff sturdy, legs like small towers; latter pliant indiarubber quick lightning. Day day stood foot foot, offered first one hand other, grappled closed, swayed strained, till well-aimed crook heel thrust loin took effect, fair back-fall ended matter. And Tom watched his eyes, first challenged one less scientific, threw him; one one wrestled his way leaders. Then indeed months he poor time it; long indeed he could manage keep his legs Job, hero slow offence, gained his victories chiefly allowing others throw his immovable legs loins. But Harry Winburn undeniably his master; first clutch hands stood up, last trip sent his back turf, he felt Harry knew could he. Luckily Harry's bright unconsciousness Tom's natural good temper kept quarrelling; Tom worked on, trod nearly Harry's heels, last mastered dodges falls except one. This one Harry's particular invention pet; he scarcely ever used except hard pressed, came, sure did, went poor Tom. He thought fall his meals, his walks, he lay awake bed, his dreams, purpose, Harry one day his open way suggested he thought met; week time boys equal, save slight difference strength Harry's favour, extra ten months age gave. Tom often afterwards reason thankful early drilling, all, mastered Harry Winburn's fall. Besides home games, Saturdays boys would wander neighbourhood; sometimes downs, camp, cut initials springy turf, watched hawks soaring, “peert” bird, Harry Winburn called gray plover, gorgeous his wedding feathers; home, racing Manger many roll among thistles, Uffington Wood watch fox cubs playing green rides; sometimes Rosy Brook, cut long whispering reeds grew there, make pan-pipes of; sometimes Moor Mills, piece old forest land, short browsed turf tufted brambly thickets stretching oaks, amongst rumour declared raven, last his race, still lingered; sand-hills, vain quest rabbits; bird-nesting season, anywhere everywhere. The neighbours Squire's rank every would shrug shoulders drove rode party boys Tom middle, carrying along bulrushes whispering reeds, great bundles cowslip meadow-sweet, young starlings magpies, spoil wood, brook, meadow; Lawyer Red-tape might mutter Squire Straight-back Board good would come young Browns, let run wild dirty village boys, best farmers' sons even would play with. And squire might reply shake his head his sons mixed equals, never went village without governess footman. But, luckily, Squire Brown full stiffbacked his neighbours, went his way; Tom his younger brothers, grew up, went playing village boys, without idea equality inequality (except wrestling, running, climbing) ever entering heads; does not till it is put Jack Nastys fine ladies' maids. I do not mean say would case villages, certainly one: village boys full manly honest, certainly purer, higher rank; Tom got harm his equals his first fortnight private school, he went he nine years old, he his village friends day he left Charity's apron-strings. Great grief amongst village school-boys Tom drove Squire, one August morning, meet coach his way school. Each given little present best he had, his small private box full peg-taps, white marbles (called “alley-taws” Vale), screws, birds' eggs, whip-cord, jews-harps, miscellaneous boys' wealth. Poor Jacob Doodle-calf, floods tears, pressed upon spluttering earnestness his lame pet hedgehog (he always poor broken-down beast bird him); Tom obliged refuse, Squire's order. He given great tea big elm playground, Madam Brown supplied biggest cake ever seen village; Tom really sorry leave lose him, his sorrow unmixed pride excitement making new step life. And feeling carried his first parting his mother better could expected. Their love fair whole human love be--perfect self-sacrifice one side meeting young true heart other. It within scope book, however, speak family relations, I much say subject English mothers--ay, English fathers, sisters, brothers too. Neither I room speak private schools. What I say public schools--those much-abused much-belauded institutions peculiar England. So must hurry Master Tom's year private school fast can. It fair average specimen, kept gentleman, another gentleman second master; little enough real work did--merely coming school lessons prepared ready heard. The whole discipline school lesson hours hands two ushers, one always boys playground, school, meals--in fact, times every where, till fairly bed night. Now theory private schools (or was) constant supervision school--therein differing fundamentally public schools. It may right wrong; right, supervision surely ought especial work head-master, responsible person. The object schools ram Latin Greek boys, make good English boys, good future citizens; far important part work must done, done, school hours. To leave it, therefore, hands inferior men, giving highest hardest part work education. Were I private school-master, I say, Let hear boys lessons, let live play rest. The two ushers Tom's first school gentlemen, poorly educated, driving poor trade usher get living could it. They bad men, little heart work, course bent making easy possible. One methods endeavoured accomplish encouraging tale-bearing, become frightfully common vice school consequence, sapped foundations school morality. Another was, favouring grossly biggest boys, alone could given much trouble; whereby young gentlemen became abominable tyrants, oppressing little boys small mean ways prevail private schools. Poor little Tom made dreadfully unhappy his first week catastrophe happened his first letter home. With huge labour he had, evening his arrival, managed fill two sides sheet letter-paper assurances his love dear mamma, his happiness school, his resolves she would wish. This missive, help boy sat desk next him, also new arrival, he managed fold successfully; done, sadly put means sealing. Envelopes unknown; wax, dared disturb stillness evening school-room getting going ask usher some. At length Tom's friend, ingenious turn mind, suggested sealing ink; letter accordingly stuck blob ink, duly handed Tom, his way bed, housekeeper posted. It till four days afterwards good dame sent him, produced precious letter wax, saying, “O Master Brown, I forgot tell before, letter is not sealed.” Poor Tom took wax silence sealed his letter, huge lump rising his throat process, ran away quiet corner playground, burst agony tears. The idea his mother waiting day day letter he promised her once, perhaps thinking forgetful her, he done his power make good his promise, bitter grief he undergo many long year. His wrath, then, proportionately violent he aware two boys, stopped close him, one whom, fat gaby fellow, pointed called “Young mammy-sick!” Whereupon Tom arose, giving vent thus his grief shame rage, smote his derider nose; made bleed; sent young worthy howling usher, reported Tom violent unprovoked assault battery. Hitting face felony punishable flogging, hitting misdemeanour--a distinction altogether clear principle. Tom, however, escaped penalty pleading primum tempus; written second letter his mother, inclosing forget-me-nots, he picked first half-holiday walk, felt quite happy again, began enjoy vastly good deal his new life. These half-holiday walks great events week. The whole fifty boys started dinner one ushers Hazeldown, distant mile school. Hazeldown measured three miles round, neighbourhood several woods full manner birds butterflies. The usher walked slowly round boys liked accompany him; rest scattered directions, bound appear usher completed his round, accompany home. They forbidden, however, go anywhere except woods; village especially prohibited, huge bull's-eyes unctuous toffy might procured exchange coin realm. Various amusements boys betook themselves. At entrance steep hillock, like barrows Tom's downs. This mound weekly scene terrific combats, game called queer name “mud-patties.” The boys played divided sides different leaders, one side occupied mound. Then, parties provided many sods turf, cut bread-and-cheese knives, side remained bottom proceeded assault mound, advancing sides cover heavy fire turfs, struggling victory occupants, soon could, even moment, clear summit, turn became besieged. It good, rough, dirty game, great use counteracting sneaking tendencies school. Then others boys spread downs, looking holes humble-bees mice, dug without mercy, often (I regret say) killing skinning unlucky mice, (I regret say) getting well stung bumble-bees. Others went butterflies birds' eggs seasons; Tom found Hazeldown, first time, beautiful little blue butterfly golden spots his wings, he never seen his downs, dug his first sand-martin's nest. This latter achievement resulted flogging, sand-martins built high bank close village, consequently bounds; one bolder spirits school, never could happy unless he something risk attached, easily persuaded Tom break bounds visit martins' bank. From whence step toffy shop, could simple go fill pockets; certain return, distribution treasure made, usher shortly detect forbidden smell bull's-eyes, and, search ensuing, discover state breeches-pockets Tom his ally? This ally Tom's indeed desperate hero sight boys, feared one dealt magic, something approaching thereto. Which reputation came wise. The boys went bed eight, and, course, consequently lay awake dark hour two, telling ghost-stories turns. One night came his turn, he dried souls his story, he suddenly declared he would make fiery hand appear door; astonishment terror boys his room, hand, something like it, pale light, appear. The fame exploit spread rooms, discredited there, young necromancer declared wonder would appear rooms turn, accordingly did; whole circumstances privately reported one ushers usual, functionary, listening doors rooms, sudden descent caught performer his night-shirt, box phosphorus his guilty hand. Lucifer-matches present facilities getting acquainted fire unknown--the name phosphorus something diabolic boy-mind; Tom's ally, cost sound flogging, earned many older folk covet much--the decided fear his companions. He remarkable boy, means bad one. Tom stuck till he left, got many scrapes doing. But he great opponent tale-bearing habits school, open enemy ushers; worthy support. Tom imbibed fair amount Latin Greek school, somehow, whole, did not suit him, he it, holidays he constantly working Squire send public school. Great his joy then, middle his third half-year, October 183-, fever broke village, master slightly sickened it, whole boys sent day's notice respective homes. The Squire quite pleased Master Tom see young gentleman's brown, merry face appear home, two months proper time, Christmas holidays; so, putting his thinking cap, he retired his study wrote several letters, result that, one morning breakfast-table, fortnight Tom's return, he addressed his wife with--“My dear, I arranged Tom shall go Rugby once, last six weeks half-year, instead wasting riding loitering home. It kind doctor allow it. Will see his things ready Friday, I shall take town, send next day himself.” Mrs. Brown prepared announcement, merely suggested doubt whether Tom yet old enough travel himself. However, finding father son her point, she gave in, like wise woman, proceeded prepare Tom's kit his launch public school. CHAPTER IV--THE STAGE COACH. “Let steam-pot hiss till it is hot; Give speed Tantivy trot.” Coaching Song, R.E.E. Warburton, Esq. “Now, sir, time get up, please. Tally-ho coach Leicester'll round half hour, do not wait nobody.” So spake boots Peacock Inn Islington, half-past two of the clock morning day early part November 183-, giving Tom time shake shoulder, putting candle; carrying his shoes clean. Tom his father arrived town Berkshire day before, finding, inquiry, Birmingham coaches ran city pass Rugby, deposited passengers Dunchurch, village three miles distant main road, said passengers wait Oxford Leicester coach evening, take post-chaise, resolved Tom travel Tally-ho, diverged main road passed Rugby itself. And Tally-ho early coach, driven Peacock road. Tom never London, would liked stopped Belle Savage, put Star, dusk, he might gone roving endless, mysterious, gas-lit streets, which, glare hum moving crowds, excited he could not talk even. But soon he found Peacock arrangement would get Rugby twelve of the clock day, whereas otherwise he would not till evening, plans melted away, his one absorbing aim become public school-boy fast possible, six hours sooner later seeming alarming importance. Tom his father alighted Peacock seven evening; heard unfeigned joy paternal order, bar, steaks oyster-sauce supper half hour, seen his father seated cozily bright fire coffee-room paper his hand, Tom run see him, wondered vehicles passing repassing, fraternized boots hostler, he ascertained Tally-ho tip-top goer--ten miles hour including stoppages--and punctual road set clocks her. Then summoned supper, he regaled one bright little boxes Peacock coffee-room, beef-steak unlimited oyster-sauce brown stout (tasted first time--a day marked ever Tom white stone); first attended excellent advice his father bestowing his glass steaming brandy-and-water, began nodding, united effects stout, fire, lecture; till Squire, observing Tom's state, remembering nearly nine of the clock, Tally-ho left three, sent little fellow chambermaid, shake hand (Tom stipulated morning starting kissing cease them), parting words: “And now, Tom, boy,” said Squire, “remember going, earnest request, chucked great school, like young bear, troubles you--earlier sent perhaps. If schools time, you will see great many cruel blackguard things done, hear deal foul, bad talk. But never fear. You tell truth, keep brave kind heart, never listen say anything would not mother sister hear, you will never feel ashamed come home, see you.” The allusion his mother made Tom feel rather choky, he would liked hugged his father well, had not recent stipulation. As was, he squeezed his father's hand, looked bravely said, “I will try, father.” “I know will, boy. Is money safe? “Yes,” said Tom, diving one pocket make sure. “And keys?” said Squire. “All right,” said Tom, diving pocket. “Well, then, good-night. God bless you! I will tell boots call you, see off.” Tom carried chambermaid brown study, he roused clean little attic, buxom person calling little darling kissing she left room; indignity he much surprised resent. And still thinking his father's last words, look spoken, he knelt prayed that, come might, he might never bring shame sorrow dear folk home. Indeed, Squire's last words deserved effect, result much anxious thought. All way London he pondered he say Tom way parting advice--something boy could keep his head ready use. By way assisting meditation, he even gone length taking his flint steel tinder, hammering away quarter hour till he manufactured light long Trichinopoli cheroot, he silently puffed, small wonder coachee, old friend, institution Bath road, always expected talk prospects doings, agricultural social, whole country, he carried Squire. To condense Squire's meditation, somewhat follows: “I will not tell read his Bible, love serve God; he do not his mother's sake teaching, he will not mine. Shall I go sort temptations he will meet with? No, I cannot that. Never old fellow go things boy. He will not understand me. Do harm good, ten one. Shall I tell mind his work, say he is sent school make good scholar? Well, he is not sent school that--at rate, mainly. I do not care straw Greek particles, digamma; his mother. What he sent school for? Well, partly he wanted go. If he will turn brave, helpful, truth-telling Englishman, gentleman, Christian, that is I want,” thought Squire; upon view case he framed his last words advice Tom, well enough suited his purpose. For Tom's first thoughts he tumbled bed summons boots, proceeded rapidly wash dress himself. At ten minutes three he coffee-room his stockings, carrying his hat-box, coat, comforter his hand; he found his father nursing bright fire, cup hot coffee hard biscuit table. “Now, then, Tom, give us things here, drink this. There is nothing like starting warm, old fellow.” Tom addressed coffee, prattled away he worked his shoes his greatcoat, well warmed through--a Petersham coat velvet collar, made tight abominable fashion days. And he swallowing his last mouthful, winding his comforter round his throat, tucking ends breast his coat, horn sounds; boots looks says, “Tally-ho, sir;” hear ring rattle four fast trotters town-made drag, dashes Peacock. “Anything us, Bob?” says burly guard, dropping behind, slapping across chest. “Young gen'lm'n, Rugby; three parcels, Leicester; hamper game, Rugby,” answers hostler. “Tell young gent look alive,” says guard, opening hind-boot shooting parcels examining lamps. “Here; shove portmanteau a-top. I will fasten presently.--Now then, sir, jump behind.” “Good-bye, father--my love home.” A last shake hand. Up goes Tom, guard catching his hatbox holding one hand, he claps horn his mouth. Toot, toot, toot! hostlers let go heads, four bays plunge collar, away goes Tally-ho darkness, forty-five seconds time pulled up. Hostler, boots, Squire stand looking Peacock lamp. “Sharp work!” says Squire, goes his bed, coach well sight hearing. Tom stands coach looks back his father's figure long he see it; guard, disposed his luggage, comes anchor, finishes his buttonings preparations facing three hours dawn--no joke minded cold, fast coach November, reign his late Majesty. I sometimes think boys generation deal tenderer fellows used be. At rate you are much comfortable travellers, I see every one his rug plaid, dodges preserving caloric, going in, fuzzy, dusty, padded first-class carriages. It another affair altogether, dark ride top Tally-ho, I tell you, tight Petersham coat, feet dangling six inches floor. Then knew cold was, without legs, bit feeling first half-hour. But pleasures, old dark ride. First consciousness silent endurance, dear every Englishman--of standing something, giving in. Then music rattling harness, ring horses' feet hard road, glare two bright lamps steaming hoar frost, leaders' ears, darkness, cheery toot guard's horn, warn drowsy pikeman hostler next change; looking forward daylight; last, least, delight returning sensation toes. Then break dawn sunrise, ever seen perfection coach roof? You want motion change music see glory--not music singing men singing women, good, silent music, sets head, accompaniment work getting ground. The Tally-ho past St. Albans, Tom enjoying ride, though half-frozen. The guard, alone back coach, silent, muffled Tom's feet straw, put end oat-sack his knees. The darkness driven inwards, he gone his little past life, thought his doings promises, his mother sister, his father's last words; made fifty good resolutions, means bear like brave Brown he is, though young one. Then he forward mysterious boy-future, speculating sort place Rugby is, there, calling stories public schools he heard big boys holidays. He choke-full hope life, notwithstanding cold, kicks his heels back-board, would like sing, he does not know his friend silent guard might take it. And dawn breaks end fourth stage, coach pulls little roadside inn huge stables behind. There bright fire gleaming red curtains bar window, door open. The coachman catches his whip double thong, throws hostler; steam horses rises straight air. He put along last two miles, two minutes his time. He rolls box inn. The guard rolls behind. “Now, sir,” says he Tom, “you jump down, I will give drop something keep cold out.” Tom finds difficulty jumping, indeed finding top wheel his feet, may next world he feels; guard picks coach top, sets his legs, stump bar, join coachman outside passengers. Here fresh-looking barmaid serves glass early purl stand fire, coachman guard exchanging business remarks. The purl warms cockles Tom's heart, makes cough. “Rare tackle that, sir, cold morning,” says coachman, smiling. “Time's up.” They up; coachee last, gathering reins his hands talking Jem hostler mare's shoulder, swinging box--the horses dashing canter he falls his seat. Toot-toot-tootle-too goes horn, away again, five-and-thirty miles road (nearly half-way Rugby, thinks Tom), prospect breakfast end stage. And begin see, early life country-side comes out--a market cart two; men smock-frocks going work, pipe mouth, whiff bad smell bright morning. The sun gets up, mist shines like silver gauze. They pass hounds jogging along distant meet, heels huntsman's back, whose face colour tails his old pink, he exchanges greetings coachman guard. Now pull lodge, take board well-muffled-up sportsman, his gun-case carpet-bag, An early up-coach meets them, coachmen gather horses, pass one another accustomed lift elbow, team eleven miles hour, mile spare behind necessary. And comes breakfast. “Twenty minutes here, gentlemen,” says coachman, pull half-past seven inn-door. Have endured nobly morning? worthy reward much endurance? There low, dark wainscoted room hung sporting prints; hat-stand (with whip two standing belonging bagmen still snug bed) door; blazing fire, quaint old glass mantelpiece, stuck large card list meets week county hounds; table covered whitest cloths china, bearing pigeon-pie, ham, round cold boiled beef cut mammoth ox, great loaf household bread wooden trencher. And comes stout head waiter, puffing tray hot viands--kidneys steak, transparent rashers poached eggs, buttered toast muffins, coffee tea, smoking hot. The table never hold all. The cold meats removed sideboard--they put show give us appetite. And fall on, gentlemen all. It well-known sporting-house, breakfasts famous. Two three men pink, way meet, drop in, jovial sharp-set, indeed are. “Tea coffee, sir?” says head waiter, coming round Tom. “Coffee, please,” says Tom, his mouth full muffin kidney. Coffee treat him, tea not. Our coachman, I perceive, breakfasts us, cold beef man. He also eschews hot potations, addicts tankard ale, brought barmaid. Sportsman looks approvingly, orders ditto himself. Tom eaten kidney pigeon-pie, imbibed coffee, till his little skin tight drum; pleasure paying head waiter his purse, dignified manner, walks inn-door see horses put to. This done leisurely highly-finished manner hostlers, enjoyed hurried. Coachman comes his waybill, puffing fat cigar sportsman given him. Guard emerges tap, he prefers breakfasting, licking round tough-looking doubtful cheroot, might tie round finger, three whiffs would knock one else time. The pinks stand inn-door lighting cigars waiting see us start, hacks led market-place, inn looks. They know sportsman, feel reflected credit see chatting laughing them. “Now, sir, please,” says coachman. All rest passengers up; guard locking hind-boot. “A good run you!” says sportsman pinks, coachman's side time. “Let  them go, Dick!” The hostlers fly back, drawing cloths glossy loins, away go market-place High Street, looking first-floor windows, seeing several worthy burgesses shaving thereat; shopboys cleaning windows, housemaids steps, stop look pleased rattle past, part legitimate morning's amusement. We clear town, well hedgerows town clock strikes eight. The sun shines almost warmly, breakfast oiled springs loosened tongues. Tom encouraged remark two guard's puffs his oily cheroot, besides getting tired talking. He full his destination talk anything else, asks guard he knows Rugby. “Goes every day life. Twenty minutes afore twelve down--ten of the clock up.” “What sort place it, please?” says Tom. Guard looks comical expression. “Werry out-of-the-way place, sir; paving streets, lighting. 'Mazin' big horse cattle fair autumn--lasts week--just now. Takes town week get clean it. Fairish hunting country. But slow place, sir, slow place--off main road, see--only three coaches day, one  them two-oss wan, like hearse coach--Regulator--comes Oxford. Young genl'm'n school calls her Pig Whistle, goes college her (six miles hour) goes enter. Belong school, sir?” “Yes,” says Tom, unwilling moment guard think old boy. But then, qualms truth assertion, seeing he assume character old boy he could not go asking questions he wanted, added--“That say, I am way there. I am new boy.” The guard looked he knew quite well Tom. “You are werry late, sir,” says guard; “only six weeks to-day end half.” Tom assented. “We takes fine loads day six weeks, Monday Tuesday arter. Hopes shall pleasure carrying back.” Tom said he hoped would; he thought within his fate would probably Pig Whistle. “It pays uncommon cert'nly,” continues guard. “Werry free cash young genl'm'n. But, Lor' bless you, gets rows 'long road, wi' pea-shooters, long whips, hollering, upsetting every one comes by, I would sight sooner carry one two  them, sir, I may a-carryin' now, coach-load.” “What pea-shooters?” inquires Tom. “Do wi'  them! Why, peppers every one's faces comes near, 'cept young gals, breaks windows wi' too,  them shoots hard. Now it was last June, a-driving first-day boys, mendin' quarter-mile road, lot Irish chaps, reg'lar roughs, a-breaking stones. As comes up, 'Now, boys,' says young gent box (smart young fellow desper't reckless), 'here is fun! Let Pats ears.' 'God's sake sir!' says Bob (that is mate coachman); 'do not go shoot  them. They will knock us coach.' 'Damme, coachee,' says young lord, 'you are not afraid.--Hoora, boys! let  them it.' 'Hoora!' sings others, fill mouths choke-full peas last whole line. Bob, seeing it was come, knocks his hat his eyes, hollers his osses, shakes  them up; away goes line  them, twenty miles hour. The Pats begin hoora too, thinking runaway; first lot  them stands grinnin' wavin' old hats comes abreast  them; you would ha' laughed see took aback choking savage looked, gets peas a-stinging  them. But bless you, laugh were not side, sir, long way. We going fast, took aback, did not take till half-way line. Then it was, 'Look all!' surely. They howls line fit frighten you;  them runs arter us tries clamber behind, hits  them fingers pulls hands off; one sharp act'ly runs right leaders, though he would ketch  them heads, luck'ly he misses his tip comes heap stones first. The rest picks stones, gives us right away till gets shot, young gents holding werry manful pea-shooters stones lodged us, pretty many too. Then Bob picks hisself again, looks young gent box werry solemn. Bob'd rum un ribs, which'd like ha' knocked box, made drop reins. Young gent box picks hisself up, all, looks round count damage. Box's head cut open his hat gone; 'nother young gent's hat gone; mine knocked side, one us was not black blue somewheres another,  them over. Two pound ten pay damage paint, subscribed then, give Bob extra half-sovereign each; I would not go line twenty half-sovereigns.” And guard shook his head slowly, got blew clear, brisk toot-toot. “What fun!” said Tom, could scarcely contain his pride exploit his future school-fellows. He longed already end half, he might join them. “'Taint good fun, though, sir, folk meets coach, go back next day. Them Irishers last summer got stones ready us, letting drive, we would got two reverend gents aboard too. We pulled beginning line, pacified them, we are never going carry pea-shooters, unless promises fire there is line Irish chaps a-stonebreaking.” The guard stopped pulled away his cheroot, regarding Tom benignantly while. “Oh, do not stop! Tell us something pea-shooting.” “Well, there would like pretty piece work Bicester, back. We six mile town, meets old square-headed gray-haired yeoman chap, a-jogging along quite quiet. He looks coach, pea hits nose, catches his cob behind makes dance his hind legs. I see'd old boy's face flush look plaguy awkward, I thought something nasty. “He turns his cob's head rides quietly us shot. How 'ere cob step! We never shook dozen yards six miles. At first young gents werry lively him; afore got in, seeing steady old chap come on, quite quiet, laid heads together do. Some fighting, axing his pardon. He rides town close us, comes stops, says two shot must come magistrate; great crowd comes round, could not get osses to. But young uns stand one another, says none must go, they would fight out, carried. Just it was gettin' serious, old boy mob going pull  them coach, one little fellow jumps says, 'Here--I will stay. I am going three miles farther. My father's name's Davis; he is known here, I will go magistrate gentleman.' 'What! thee parson Davis's son?' says old boy. 'Yes,' says young un. 'Well, I mortal sorry meet thee company; thy father's sake thine (for thee bist brave young chap) I will say it.' Did not boys cheer him, mob cheered young chap; one biggest gets down, begs his pardon werry gentlemanly rest, saying plaguy vexed first, did not like ax his pardon till then, felt had not ought shirk consequences joke. And got down, shook hands old boy, asked parts country, homes; drives twenty minutes behind time, cheering hollering county 'members. But, Lor' bless you, sir,” says guard, smacking his hand his knee looking full Tom's face, “ten minutes arter bad ever.” Tom showed undisguised open-mouthed interest his narrations old guard rubbed his memory, launched graphic history performances boys roads last twenty years. Off road he could not go; exploit must connected horses vehicles hang old fellow's head. Tom tried his ground twice, found he knew nothing beyond, let his head, rest road bowled easily away; old Blow-hard (as boys called him) dry old file, much kindness humour, capital spinner yarn he broken neck his day's work, got plenty ale his belt. What struck Tom's youthful imagination desperate lawless character stories. Was guard hoaxing him? He could not help hoping true. It is odd almost English boys love danger. You get ten join game, climb tree, swim stream, there is chance breaking limbs getting drowned, one who will stay level ground, his depth, play quoits bowls. The guard finished account desperate fight happened one fairs drovers farmers whips, boys cricket-bats wickets, arose playful objectionable practice boys going round public-houses taking linch-pins wheels gigs, moralizing upon way Doctor, “a terrible stern man he would heard tell,” come upon several performers, “sending three  them next morning po-shay parish constable,” turned corner neared milestone, third Rugby. By stone two boys stood, jackets buttoned tight, waiting coach. “Look here, sir,” says guard, giving sharp toot-toot; “there is two  them; out-and-out runners be. They comes twice three times week, spirts mile alongside us.” And came up, sure enough, away went two boys along footpath, keeping horses--the first light, clean-made fellow going springs; stout round-shouldered, labouring his pace, going dogged bull-terrier. Old Blow-hard looked admiringly. “See beautiful un holds hisself together, goes his hips, sir,” said he; “he is 'mazin' fine runner. Now many coachmen drives first-rate team'd put on, try pass  them. But Bob, sir, bless you, he is tender-hearted; he would sooner pull bit he see'd  them a-gettin' beat. I b'lieve, too, un'd sooner break his heart let us go afore next milestone.” At second milestone boys pulled short, waved hats guard, his watch shouted “4.56,” thereby indicating mile done four seconds five minutes. They passed several parties boys, objects deepest interest Tom, came sight town ten minutes twelve. Tom fetched long breath, thought he never spent pleasanter day. Before he went bed he quite settled must greatest day he ever spend, did not alter his opinion many long year--if he yet. CHAPTER V--RUGBY AND FOOTBALL. “Foot eye opposed In dubious strife.”--Scott. “And here is Rugby, sir, last, you will plenty time dinner School-house, I telled you,” said old guard, pulling his horn case tootle-tooing away, coachman shook his horses, carried along side school close, round Dead-man's corner, past school-gates, High Street Spread Eagle, wheelers spanking trot, leaders cantering, style would disgraced “Cherry Bob,” “ramping, stamping, tearing, swearing Billy Harwood,” old coaching heroes. Tom's heart beat quick he passed great schoolfield close, noble elms, several games football going on, tried take long line gray buildings, beginning chapel, ending School-house, residence head-master, great flag lazily waving highest round tower. And he began already proud Rugby boy, he passed schoolgates, oriel window above, saw boys standing there, looking town belonged them, nodding familiar manner coachman, one would quite equal getting box, working team street well he. One young heroes, however, ran rest, scrambled behind; where, righted himself, nodded guard, “How do, Jem?” he turned short round Tom, looking minute, began,-- “I say, fellow, name Brown?” “Yes,” said Tom, considerable astonishment, glad, however, lighted one already seemed know him. “Ah, I thought so. You know old aunt, Miss East. She lives somewhere way Berkshire. She wrote coming to-day, asked give lift.” Tom somewhat inclined resent patronizing air his new friend, boy his height age, gifted transcendent coolness assurance, Tom felt aggravating hard bear, could not life help admiring envying--especially young lord begins hectoring two three long loafing fellows, half porter, half stableman, strong touch blackguard, end arranges one them, nicknamed Cooey, carry Tom's luggage School-house sixpence. “And hark 'ee, Cooey; must ten minutes, jobs me. Come along, Brown.” And away swaggers young potentate, his hands his pockets, Tom his side. “All right, sir,” says Cooey, touching his hat, leer wink his companions. “Hullo though,” says East, pulling up, taking another look Tom; “this will never do. Have not got hat? We never wear caps here. Only louts wear caps. Bless you, go quadrangle thing on, I do not know what did happen.” The idea quite beyond young Master East, he looked unutterable things. Tom thought his cap knowing affair, confessed he hat his hat-box; accordingly extracted hind-boot, Tom equipped his go-to-meeting roof, his new friend called it. But did not quite suit his fastidious taste another minute, shiny; so, walk town, dive Nixon's hatter's, Tom arrayed, his utter astonishment, without paying it, regulation cat-skin seven-and-sixpence, Nixon undertaking send best hat matron's room, School-house, half hour. “You send note tile Monday, make right, know,” said Mentor; “we are allowed two seven-and-sixers half, besides bring home.” Tom time began conscious his new social position dignities, luxuriate realized ambition public school-boy last, vested right spoiling two seven-and-sixers half year. “You see,” said his friend, strolled towards school-gates, explanation his conduct, “a great deal depends fellow cuts first. If he is got nothing odd him, answers straightforward, holds his head up, he gets on. Now, you will well rig, cap. You see I am handsome thing you, father knows yours; besides, I want please old lady. She gave half sov. half, perhaps'll double next, I keep her good books.” There is nothing candour like lower-school boy, East genuine specimen--frank, hearty, good-natured, well-satisfied his position, choke-full life spirits, Rugby prejudices traditions he able get together long course one half-year he School-house. And Tom, notwithstanding his bumptiousness, felt friends once, began sucking his ways prejudices, fast he could understand them. East great character cicerone. He carried Tom great gates, two three boys. These satisfied stock questions, “You fellow, what is name? Where come from? How old you? Where board?” and, “What form in?” And passed quadrangle small courtyard, upon looked lot little windows (belonging, his guide informed him, School-house studies), matron's room, East introduced Tom dignitary; made give key his trunk, matron might unpack his linen, told story hat his presence mind: upon relation whereof matron laughingly scolded coolest new boy house; East, indignant accusation newness, marched Tom quadrangle, began showing schools, examining his literary attainments; result prophecy would form, could lessons together. “And come see study--we shall time dinner; afterwards, calling over, we will close.” Tom followed his guide School-house hall, opens quadrangle. It great room, thirty feet long eighteen high, thereabouts, two great tables running whole length, two large fireplaces side, blazing fires them, one dozen boys standing lounging, shouted East stop; he shot his convoy, landed long, dark passages, large fire end each, upon studies opened. Into one these, bottom passage, East bolted hero, slamming bolting door behind them, case pursuit hall, Tom first time Rugby boy's citadel. He had not prepared separate studies, little astonished delighted palace question. It was not large, certainly, six feet long four broad. It could not called light, bars grating window; little precautions necessary studies ground-floor looking close, prevent exit small boys locking up, entrance contraband articles. But uncommonly comfortable look at, Tom thought. The space window farther end occupied square table covered reasonably clean whole red blue check tablecloth; hard-seated sofa covered red stuff occupied one side, running end, making seat one, sitting close, two, table good stout wooden chair afforded seat another boy, three could sit work together. The walls wainscoted half-way up, wainscot covered green baize, remainder bright-patterned paper, hung three four prints dogs' heads; Grimaldi winning Aylesbury steeple-chase; Amy Robsart, reigning Waverley beauty day; Tom Crib, posture defence, credit science hero, truly represented. Over door row hat-pegs, side bookcases cupboards bottom, shelves cupboards filled indiscriminately school-books, cup two, mouse-trap candlesticks, leather straps, fustian bag, curious-looking articles puzzled Tom little, his friend explained climbing-irons, showed use. A cricket-bat small fishing-rod stood one corner. This residence East another boy form, interest Tom Windsor Castle, residence British Isles. For he become joint owner similar home, first place he could call his own? One's own! What charm words! How long takes boy man find worth! How fast us hold them--faster jealously, nearer general home take nothing, must go naked came world! When shall learn he multiplieth possessions multiplieth troubles, one single use things call may his hath need them? “And shall I study like too?” said Tom. “Yes, course; you will chummed fellow Monday, sit till then.” “What nice places!” “They are well enough,” answered East, patronizingly, “only uncommon cold nights sometimes. Gower--that is chum--and I make fire paper floor supper generally, makes smoky.” “But there is big fire passage,” said Tom. “Precious little get that, though,” said East. “Jones praepostor study fire end, he rigged iron rod green baize curtain across passage, he draws night, sits his door open; he gets fire, hears come studies eight, make noise. However, he is taken sitting fifth-form room lately, get bit fire sometimes; keep sharp lookout he do not catch behind his curtain he comes down--that is all.” A quarter past one struck, bell began tolling dinner; went hall took places, Tom bottom second table, next praepostor (who sat end keep order there), East paces higher. And Tom first time saw his future school-fellows body. In came, hot ruddy football long walks, pale chilly hard reading studies, loitering fire pastrycook's, dainty mortals, bringing pickles saucebottles help dinners. And great big-bearded man, Tom took master, began calling names, great joints rapidly carved third table corner old verger housekeeper. Tom's turn came last, meanwhile he eyes, looking first awe great man, sat close him, helped first, read hard-looking book time he eating; he got walked fire, small boys round him, reading, rest talking whispers one another, stealing one another's bread, shooting pellets, digging forks tablecloth. However, notwithstanding his curiosity, he managed make capital dinner time big man called “Stand up!” said grace. As soon dinner over, Tom questioned his neighbours curious his birth, parentage, education, like matters, East, evidently enjoyed his new dignity patron mentor, proposed look close, Tom, athirst knowledge, gladly assented to; went quadrangle past big fives court, great playground. “That is chapel, see,” said East; “and there, behind it, place fights. You see it is way masters, live side, do not come first lesson callings-over. That is fights come off. And part little-side ground, right trees; side trees big-side ground, great matches played. And there is island farthest corner; you will know well enough next half, there is island fagging. I say, it is horrid cold; let us run across.” And away went East, Tom close behind him. East evidently putting his best foot foremost; Tom, mighty proud his running, little anxious show his friend that, although new boy, he milksop, laid work his best style. Right across close went, he knew, was not yard pulled island moat. “I say,” said East, soon he got his wind, looking much increased respect Tom, “you are not bad scud, means. Well, I am warm toast now.” “But wear white trousers November?” said Tom. He struck peculiarity costume almost School-house boys. “Why, bless us, do not know? No; I forgot. Why, to-day's School-house match. Our house plays whole School football. And wear white trousers, show  them do not care hacks. You are luck come to-day. You see match; Brooke's going let play quarters. That is he will lower-school boy, except James, he is fourteen.” “Who is Brooke?” “Why, big fellow called dinner, sure. He is cock school, head School-house side, best kick charger Rugby.” “Oh, show play. And tell it. I love football so, played life. Will not Brooke let play?” “Not he,” said East, indignation. “Why, do not know rules; you will month learning them. And it is joke playing-up match, I tell you--quite another thing private school games. Why, there is two collar-bones broken half, dozen fellows lamed. And last year fellow his leg broken.” Tom listened profoundest respect chapter accidents, followed East across level ground till came sort gigantic gallows two poles, eighteen feet high, fixed upright ground fourteen feet apart, cross-bar running one height ten feet thereabouts. “This one goals,” said East, “and see other, across there, right opposite, Doctor's wall. Well, match best three goals; whichever side kicks two goals wins: will not do, see, kick ball posts--it must go cross-bar; height'll do, long it is posts. You will stay goal touch ball rolls behind posts, side touch try goal. Then fellows quarters, play front goal here, turn ball kick back big fellows side follow up. And front us big fellows play, that is scrummages mostly.” Tom's respect increased he struggled make his friend's technicalities, set work explain mysteries “off side,” “drop-kicks,” “punts,” “places,” intricacies great science football. “But keep ball goals?” said he; “I cannot see might not go right chapel.” “Why; that is play,” answered East. “You see gravel-walk running along side playing-ground, line elms opposite other? Well, they are bounds. As soon ball gets past them, it is touch, play. And whoever first touches knock straight amongst players-up, make two lines space them, every fellow going his side. Are not fine scrummages then! And three trees see come play, that is tremendous place ball hangs there, get thrown trees, that is worse hack.” Tom wondered within himself, strolled back towards fives court, whether matches really break-neck affairs East represented, whether, were, he ever get like play well. He had not long wonder, however, next minute East cried out, “Hurrah! here is punt-about; come along try hand kick.” The punt-about practice-ball, brought kicked anyhow one boy another callings-over dinner, odd times. They joined boys brought out, small School-house fellows, friends East; Tom pleasure trying his skill, performed creditably, first driving his foot three inches ground, nearly kicking his leg air, vigorous efforts accomplish drop-kick manner East. Presently boys bigger came out, boys houses way calling-over, balls sent for. The crowd thickened three of the clock approached; hour struck, one hundred fifty boys hard work. Then balls held, master week came cap gown calling-over, whole school three hundred boys swept big school answer names. “I may come in, may not I?” said Tom, catching East arm, longing feel one them. “Yes, come along; nobody'll say anything. You will not eager get calling-over month,” replied his friend; marched big school together, farther end, illustrious form, lower fourth, honour East's patronage time being, stood. The master mounted high desk door, one praepostors week stood steps, three marching middle school canes, calling out, “Silence, silence!” The sixth form stood close door left, thirty number, mostly great big grown men, Tom thought, surveying distance awe; fifth form behind them, twice number, quite big. These left; right lower fifth, she will, junior forms order; middle marched three praepostors. Then praepostor stands master calls names, beginning sixth form; he calls boy answers “here” his name, walks out. Some sixth stop door turn whole string boys close. It great match-day, every boy school, he, nill he, must there. The rest sixth go forwards close, see one escapes side gates. To-day, however, School-house match, none School-house praepostors stay door watch truants side; carte blanche School-house fags go like. “They trust honour,” East proudly informs Tom; “they know well School-house boy would cut match. If he did, we would soon cut him, I tell you.” The master week short-sighted, praepostors week small well work, lower-school boys employ ten minutes elapse names called pelting one another vigorously acorns, fly directions. The small praepostors dash every then, generally chastise quiet, timid boy equally afraid acorns canes, principal performers get dexterously way. And calling-over rolls somehow, much like big world, punishments lighting wrong shoulders, matters going generally queer, cross-grained way, end coming somehow, is, all, great point. And master week finished, locked big school; praepostors week come out, sweeping last remnant school fags, loafing corners fives court, hopes chance bolting, close. “Hold punt-about!” “To goals!” cries; stray balls impounded authorities, whole mass boys moves towards two goals, dividing go three bodies. That little band left, consisting fifteen twenty boys, Tom amongst them, making goal School-house wall, School-house boys play up, stay goal. The larger body moving island goal School boys like predicament. The great mass middle players-up, sides mingled together; hanging jackets (and mean real work), hats, waistcoats, neck-handkerchiefs, braces, railings round small trees; go twos threes respective grounds. There none colour tastiness get-up, perceive, lends life present game Rugby, making dullest worst-fought match pretty sight. Now house uniform cap jersey, lively colour; time speaking plush caps yet come in, uniforms sort, except School-house white trousers, abominably cold to-day. Let us get work, bare-headed, girded plain leather straps. But mean business, gentlemen. And two sides fairly sundered, occupies ground, get good look them, absurdity this? You do not mean say fifty sixty boys white trousers, many quite small, going play huge mass opposite? Indeed I do, gentlemen. They are going try, rate, will not make bad fight either, mark word; has not old Brooke toss, his lucky halfpenny, got choice goals kick-off? The new ball may see lie quite itself, middle, pointing towards School island goal; another minute well way there. Use minute remarking Schoolhouse side drilled. You see, first place, sixth-form boy, charge goal, spread his force (the goalkeepers) occupy whole space behind goal-posts, distances five yards apart. A safe well-kept goal foundation good play. Old Brooke talking captain quarters, he moves away. See youngster spreads his men (the light brigade) carefully ground, half-way goal body players-up (the heavy brigade). These play several bodies. There young Brooke bull-dogs. Mark well. They “fighting brigade,” “die-hards,” larking leap-frog keep warm, playing tricks one another. And side old Brooke, standing middle ground going kick off, see separate wing players-up, boy acknowledged prowess look to--here Warner, Hedge; old Brooke, absolute he Russia, wisely bravely ruling willing worshipping subjects, true football king. His face earnest careful he glances last time his array, full pluck hope--the sort look I hope see general I go fight. The School side organized way. The goal-keepers lumps, anyhow nohow; cannot distinguish players-up boys quarters, divided leadership. But odds strength weight must take hinder winning; leaders seem think, let players-up manage themselves. But look! slight move forward School-house wings, shout “Are ready?” loud affirmative reply. Old Brooke takes half dozen quick steps, away goes ball spinning towards School goal, seventy yards touches ground, point twelve fifteen feet high, model kick-off; School-house cheer rush on. The ball returned, meet drive back amongst masses School already motion. Then two sides close, see nothing minutes swaying crowd boys, one point violently agitated. That ball is, keen players met, glory hard knocks got. You hear dull thud, thud ball, shouts “Off side,” “Down him,” “Put over,” “Bravo.” This call “a scrummage,” gentlemen, first scrummage School-house match joke consulship Plancus. But see! broken; ball driven School-house side, rush School carries past School-house players-up. “Look quarters,” Brooke's twenty voices ring out. No need call, though: School-house captain quarters caught bound, dodges foremost School boys, heading rush, sends back good drop-kick well enemy's country. And follows rush upon rush, scrummage upon scrummage, ball driven School-house quarters, School goal; School-house lost advantage kick-off slight wind gave outset, slightly “penning” adversaries. You say do not see much all--nothing struggling mass boys, leather ball seems excite great fury, red rag bull. My dear sir, battle would look much you, except boys would men, balls iron; battle would worth looking that, football match. You cannot expected appreciate delicate strokes play, turns game lost won--it takes old player that; broad philosophy football understand will. Come along little nearer, let us consider together. The ball fallen two sides thickest, close rapidly around scrummage. It must driven force skill, till flies one side other. Look differently boys face it! Here come two bulldogs, bursting outsiders; go, straight heart scrummage, bent driving ball opposite side. That mean do. My sons, sons! hot; gone past ball, must struggle right scrummage, get round back side, use. Here comes young Brooke; he goes straight you, keeps his head, backs bends, holding still behind ball, driving furiously he gets chance. Take leaf his book, young chargers. Here comes Speedicut, Flashman School-house bully, shouts great action. Will not two come young Brooke, locking-up, School-house fire, “Old fellow, was not splendid scrummage three trees?” But he knows you, we. You do not really want drive ball scrummage, chancing hurt glory School-house, make us think that is want--a vastly different thing; fellows kidney never go skirts scrummage, it is push kicking. We respect boys keep it, do not sham going in; you--we rather say think you. Then boys bending watching outside, mark them: useful players, dodgers, seize ball moment rolls amongst chargers, away across opposite goal. They seldom go scrummage, must coolness chargers. As endless boys' characters, ways facing facing scrummage football. Three-quarters hour gone; first winds failing, weight numbers beginning tell. Yard yard School-house driven back, contesting every inch ground. The bull-dogs colour mother earth shoulder ankle, except young Brooke, marvellous knack keeping his legs. The School-house penned turn, ball behind goal, Doctor's wall. The Doctor his family looking on, seem anxious boy success School-house. We get minute's breathing-time old Brooke kicks out, he gives word play strongly touch, three trees. Away goes ball, bull-dogs it, another minute shout “In touch!” “Our ball!” Now's time, old Brooke, men still fresh. He stands ball his hand, two sides form deep lines opposite one another; he must strike straight them. The lines thickest close him, young Brooke two three his men shifting farther, opposite line weak. Old Brooke strikes straight strong, falls opposite his brother. Hurrah! rush taken right School line, away past three trees, far quarters, young Brooke bull-dogs close upon it. The School leaders rush back, shouting, “Look goal!” strain every nerve catch him, fleetest foot Rugby. There go straight School goal-posts, quarters scattering them. One another bull-dogs go down, young Brooke holds on. “He down.” No! long stagger, danger past. That shock Crew, dangerous dodgers. And he close School goal, ball three yards him. There hurried rush School fags spot, one throws ball, chance, young Brooke touched right School goal-posts. The School leaders come furious, administer toco wretched fags nearest hand. They may well angry, Lombard Street china orange School-house kick goal ball touched good place. Old Brooke, course, kick out, shall catch place it? Call Crab Jones. Here he comes, sauntering along straw his mouth, queerest, coolest fish Rugby. If he tumbled moon minute, he would pick without taking his hands his pockets turning hair. But moment boldest charger's heart beats quick. Old Brooke stands ball his arm motioning School back; he kick till goal, behind posts. They edging forwards, inch inch, get nearer rush Crab Jones, stands front old Brooke catch ball. If reach destroy he catches, danger over; one rush carry right away School-house goal. Fond hope! kicked caught beautifully. Crab strikes his heel ground, mark spot ball caught, beyond school line may advance; stand, five deep, ready rush moment ball touches ground. Take plenty room. Do not give rush chance reaching you. Place true steady. Trust Crab Jones. He made small hole his heel ball lie on, he resting one knee, his eye old Brooke. “Now!” Crab places ball word, old Brooke kicks, rises slowly truly School rush forward. Then moment's pause, sides look spinning ball. There flies, straight two posts, five feet cross-bar, unquestioned goal; shout real, genuine joy rings School-house players-up, faint echo comes close goal-keepers Doctor's wall. A goal first hour--such thing has not done School-house match five years. “Over!” cry. The two sides change goals, School-house goal-keepers come threading way across masses School, openly triumphant them--amongst Tom, School-house boy two hours' standing--getting ears boxed transit. Tom indeed excited beyond measure, sixth-form boy, kindest safest goal-keepers, able do, keep rushing whenever ball near goal. So he holds his side, instructs science touching. At moment Griffith, itinerant vender oranges Hill Morton, enters close his heavy baskets. There rush small boys upon little pale-faced man, two sides mingling together, subdued great goddess Thirst, like English French streams Pyrenees. The leaders past oranges apples, visit coats, apply innocent-looking ginger-beer bottles mouths. It ginger-beer though, I fear, good. One short mad rush, stitch side, honest play. That is comes bottles. But Griffith's baskets empty, ball placed midway, School going kick off. Their leaders sent lumber goal, rated rest soundly, one hundred twenty picked players-up there, bent retrieving game. They keep ball front School-house goal, drive sheer strength weight. They mean heavy play mistake, old Brooke sees, places Crab Jones quarters goal, four five picked players keep ball away sides, try goal, obtained, less dangerous front. He himself, Warner Hedge, saved till now, lead charges. “Are ready?” “Yes.” And away comes ball, kicked high air, give School time rush catch falls. And amongst us. Meet like Englishmen, Schoolhouse boys, charge home. Now time show mettle you; shall warm seat hall fire, honour, lots bottled beer to-night his duty next half-hour. And well met. Again cloud players-up gathers goal, comes threatening on, Warner Hedge, young Brooke relics bull-dogs, break carry ball back; old Brooke ranges field like Job's war-horse. The thickest scrummage parts asunder his rush, like waves clipper's bows; his cheery voice rings field, his eye everywhere. And miss ball, rolls dangerously front goal, Crab Jones his men seized sent away towards sides unerring drop-kick. This worth living for--the whole sum school-boy existence gathered one straining, struggling half-hour, half-hour worth year common life. The quarter five struck, play slackens minute goal; Crew, artful dodger, driving ball behind goal, island side, quarters weakest. Is one meet him? Yes; look little East! The ball equal distances two, rush together, young man seventeen boy twelve, kick moment. Crew passes without stagger; East hurled forward shock, plunges his shoulder, he would bury ground; ball rises straight air, falls behind Crew's back, “bravoes” School-house attest pluckiest charge hard-fought day. Warner picks East lame half stunned, he hobbles back goal, conscious played man. And last minutes come, School gather last rush, every boy hundred twenty run left him. Reckless defence goal, come across level big-side ground, ball well amongst them, straight goal, like column Old Guard slope Waterloo. All former charges child's play this. Warner Hedge met them, still come. The bull-dogs rush last time; hurled carried back, striving hand, foot, eyelids. Old Brooke comes sweeping round skirts play, turning short round, picks heart scrummage, plunges in. It wavers moment; he ball. No, passed him, his voice rings clear advancing tide, “Look goal!” Crab Jones catches moment; he kick, rush upon passes him; he picks behind his straw his mouth, little dirtier, cool ever. The ball rolls slowly behind School-house goal, three yards front dozen biggest School players-up. There stands School-house praepostor, safest goal-keepers, Tom Brown his side, learned his trade time. Now time, Tom. The blood Browns up, two rush together, throw ball, feet advancing column--the praepostor his hands knees, arching his back, Tom along his face. Over topple leaders rush, shooting back praepostor, falling flat Tom, knocking wind his small carcass. “Our ball,” says praepostor, rising his prize; “but get there; there is little fellow you.” They hauled roll him, Tom discovered, motionless body. Old Brooke picks up. “Stand back, give air,” he says; feeling his limbs, adds, “No bones broken.--How feel, young un?” “Hah-hah!” gasps Tom, his wind comes back; “pretty well, thank you--all right.” “Who he?” says Brooke. “Oh, it is Brown; he is new boy; I know him,” says East, coming up. “Well, he plucky youngster, make player,” says Brooke. And five of the clock strikes. “No side” called, first day School-house match over. CHAPTER VI--AFTER THE MATCH. “Some food had.”--Shakespeare. [Greek text]--Theocr. Id. As boys scattered away ground, East, leaning Tom's arm, limping along, beginning consider luxury go buy tea celebrate glorious victory, two Brookes came striding by. Old Brooke caught sight East, stopped; put his hand kindly his shoulder, said, “Bravo, youngster; played famously. Not much matter, I hope?” “No, nothing all,” said East--“only little twist charge.” “Well, mind get right next Saturday.” And leader passed on, leaving East better words opodeldoc England would made him, Tom ready give one his ears much notice. Ah! light words love honour, power ye are, carelessly wielded use you! Surely things also God ask account. “Tea's directly locking-up, see,” said East, hobbling along fast he could, “so come along Sally Harrowell's; that is School-house tuck-shop. She bakes stunning murphies, we will penn'orth tea. Come along, they will gone.” Tom's new purse money burnt his pocket; he wondered, toddled quadrangle along street, whether East would insulted he suggested extravagance, he sufficient faith pennyworth potatoes. At last he blurted out,-- “I say, East, cannot get something else besides potatoes? I have got lots money, know.” “Bless us, yes; I forgot,” said East, “you have come. You see tin's gone twelve weeks--it hardly ever lasts beyond first fortnight; allowances stopped morning broken windows, I have not got penny. I have got tick Sally's, course; I hate running high, see, towards end half, one she will directly one comes back, that is bore.” Tom did not understand much talk, seized fact East money, denying little pet luxury consequence. “Well, shall I buy?” said he, “I am uncommon hungry.” “I say,” said East, stopping look rest his leg, “you are trump, Brown. I will next half. Let us pound sausages then. That is best grub tea I know of.” “Very well,” said Tom, pleased possible; “where sell them?” “Oh, here, opposite.” And crossed street walked cleanest little front room small house, half parlour, half shop, bought pound particular sausages, East talking pleasantly Mrs. Porter she put paper, Tom paying part. From Porter's adjourned Sally Harrowell's, found lot School-house boys waiting roast potatoes, relating exploits day's match top voices. The street opened Sally's kitchen, low brick-floored room, large recess fire, chimney-corner seats. Poor little Sally, good-natured much-enduring womankind, bustling about, napkin her hand, her oven neighbours' cottages yard back house. Stumps, her husband, short, easy-going shoemaker, beery, humorous eye ponderous calves, lived mostly his wife's earnings, stood corner room, exchanging shots roughest description repartee every boy turn. “Stumps, lout, you have much beer to-day.” “'Twasn't paying for, then.” “Stumps's calves running his ankles; want get grass.” “Better gone altogether like yours,” etc. Very poor stuff was, served make time pass; every Sally arrived middle smoking tin potatoes, cleared seconds, boy he seized his lot running house “Put two-penn'orth, Sally;” “Put three-penn'orth Davis,” etc. How she ever kept accounts straight she did, her head her slate, perfect wonder. East Tom got served last, started back School-house, locking-up bell began ring, East way recounting life adventures Stumps, character. Amongst his small avocations, he hind carrier sedan-chair, last race, Rugby ladies still went tea, which, he fairly harnessed carrying load, delight small mischievous boys follow whip his calves. This much temper even Stumps, he would pursue his tormentors vindictive apoplectic manner released, easily pacified twopence buy beer with. The lower-school boys School-house, fifteen number, tea lower-fifth school, presided old verger head-porter. Each boy quarter loaf bread pat butter, much tea he pleased; scarcely one did not add luxury, baked potatoes, herring, sprats, something sort. But period half-year could live pound Porter's sausages, East great magnificence upon strength theirs. He produced toasting-fork his study, set Tom toast sausages, he mounted guard butter potatoes. “Because,” he explained, “you are new boy, they will play trick get butter; toast well I.” So Tom, midst three four urchins similarly employed, toasted his face sausages time huge fire, till latter cracked; East his watch-tower shouted done, feast proceeded, festive cups tea filled emptied, Tom imparted sausages small bits many neighbours, thought he never tasted good potatoes seen jolly boys. They parts waived ceremony, pegged away sausages potatoes, remembering Tom's performance goal, voted East's new crony brick. After tea, things cleared away, gathered round fire, talk match still went on; show pulled trousers showed hacks received good because. They soon, however, turned school; East conducted Tom his bedroom, he might get clean things, wash singing. “What is singing?” said Tom, taking his head his basin, he plunging cold water. “Well, jolly green,” answered his friend, neighbouring basin. “Why, last six Saturdays every half sing course; first them. No first lesson do, know, lie bed to-morrow morning.” “But sings?” “Why, everybody, course; you will see soon enough. We begin directly supper, sing till bed-time. It are not good fun now, though, summer half; sing little fives court, library, know. We take tables, big boys sit round drink beer--double allowance Saturday nights; cut quadrangle songs, looks like lot robbers cave. And louts come pound great gates, pound back again, shout them. But half sing hall. Come along study.” Their principal employment study clear East's table; removing drawers ornaments tablecloth; he lived bottom passage, his table requisition singing. Supper came due course seven of the clock, consisting bread cheese beer, saved singing; directly afterwards fags went work prepare hall. The School-house hall, said, great long high room, two large fires one side, two large iron-bound tables, one running middle, along wall opposite fireplaces. Around upper fire fags placed tables form horse-shoe, upon jugs Saturday night's allowance beer. Then big boys used drop take seats, bringing bottled beer song books; although knew songs heart, thing old manuscript book descended departed hero, carefully written out. The sixth-form boys yet appeared; so, fill gap, interesting time-honoured ceremony gone through. Each new boy placed table turn, made sing solo, penalty drinking large mug salt water he resisted broke down. However, new boys sing like nightingales to-night, salt water requisition--Tom, his part, performing old west-country song “The Leather Bottel” considerable applause. And half-hour come sixth fifth form boys, take places tables, filled next biggest boys, rest, room table, standing round outside. The glasses mugs filled, fugleman strikes old sea-song, “A wet sheet flowing sea, And wind follows fast,” etc., invariable first song School-house; seventy voices join in, mindful harmony, bent noise, attain decidedly, general effect is not bad. And follow “The British Grenadiers,” “Billy Taylor,” “The Siege Seringapatam,” “Three Jolly Postboys,” vociferous songs rapid succession, including “The Chesapeake Shannon,” song lately introduced honour old Brooke; come words, “Brave Broke he waved his sword, crying, Now, lads, aboard, And we will stop playing Yankee-doodle-dandy oh!” expect roof come down. The sixth fifth know “brave Broke” Shannon sort relation old Brooke. The fourth form uncertain belief, part hold old Brooke midshipman board his uncle's ship. And lower school never doubt moment old Brooke led boarders, capacity care straw. During pauses bottled-beer corks fly rapidly, talk fast merry, big boys--at least fellow-feeling dry throats--hand mugs shoulders emptied small ones stand round behind. Then Warner, head house, gets wants speak; he cannot, every boy knows what is coming. And big boys sit tables pound cheer; small boys stand behind pound one another, cheer, rush hall cheering. Then silence made, Warner reminds old School-house custom drinking healths, first night singing, going leave end half. “He sees know he going say already” (loud cheers), “and will not keep them, ask treat toast deserves. It head eleven, head big-side football, leader glorious day--Pater Brooke!” And away goes pounding cheering again, becoming deafening old Brooke gets his legs; till, table broken down, gallon beer upset, throats getting dry, silence ensues, hero speaks, leaning his hands table, bending little forwards. No action, tricks oratory--plain, strong, straight, like his play. “Gentlemen School-house! I proud way received name, I wish I could say I like return. But I know I shall not. However, I will best I say seems ought said fellow who is going leave, spent good slice his life here. Eight years is, eight years I never hope again. So I hope you will listen me” (loud cheers “That will”), “for I am going talk seriously. You are bound listen what is use calling 'pater,' that, do not mind I say? And I am going talk seriously, I feel so. It is jolly time, too, getting end half, goal kicked us first day” (tremendous applause), “after one hardest fiercest day's play I remember eight years.” (Frantic shoutings.) “The School played splendidly, too, I say, kept last. That last charge would carried away house. I never thought see anything old Crab there, except little pieces, I saw tumbled it.” (Laughter shouting, great slapping back Jones boys nearest him.) “Well, beat  them.” (Cheers.) “Ay, beat  them? Answer that.” (Shouts “Your play.”) “Nonsense! 'Twasn't wind kick-off either--that would not it. 'Twasn't we have half dozen best players school, have. I would not change Warner, Hedge, Crab, young un, six side.” (Violent cheers.) “But half dozen fellows cannot keep two hours two hundred. Why it, then? I will tell I think. It is we have reliance one another, house feeling, fellowship School have. Each us knows depend his next-hand man better. That is beat  them to-day. We have union, they have division--there is secret.” (Cheers.) “But how is kept up? How is improved? That is question. For I take we are earnest beating School, whatever else care about. I know I would sooner win two School-house matches running get Balliol scholarship day.” (Frantic cheers.) “Now, I am proud house one. I believe it is best house school, out.” (Cheers.) “But it is long way I want see it. First, there is deal bullying going on. I know well. I do not pry interfere; makes underhand, encourages small boys come us fingers eyes telling tales, worse ever. It is little kindness sixth meddle generally--you youngsters mind that. You will better football players learning stand it, take parts, fight through. But depend it, there is nothing breaks house like bullying. Bullies cowards, one coward makes many; good-bye School-house match bullying gets ahead here.” (Loud applause small boys, look meaningly Flashman boys tables.) “Then there is fuddling public-house, drinking bad spirits, punch, rot-gut stuff. That will not make good drop-kicks chargers you, take word it. You get plenty good beer here, that is enough you; drinking is not fine manly, whatever may think it. “One thing I must word about. A lot think say, I have heard you, 'There is new Doctor has not long us, he is changing old customs. Rugby, Schoolhouse especially, going dogs. Stand good old ways, Doctor!' Now I am fond old Rugby customs ways you, I have longer you, I will give word advice time, I should not like see getting sacked. 'Down Doctor's' easier said done. You will find pretty tight his perch, I take it, awkwardish customer handle line. Besides now, customs he put down? There good old custom taking linchpins farmers' bagmen's gigs fairs, cowardly, blackguard custom was. We know came it, wonder Doctor objected it. But come now, you, name custom he put down.” “The hounds,” calls fifth-form boy, clad green cutaway brass buttons cord trousers, leader sporting interest, reputed great rider keen hand generally. “Well, six seven mangy harriers beagles belonging house, I will allow, years, Doctor put down. But good ever came them? Only rows keepers ten miles round; big-side hare-and-hounds better fun ten times over. What else?” No answer. “Well, I will not go on. Think yourselves. You will find, I believe, he do not meddle one that is worth keeping. And mind now, I say again, look squalls go way, way are not Doctor's, it will lead grief. You know I am fellow back master thick thin. If I saw stopping football, cricket, bathing, sparring, I would ready fellow stand it. But he do not; he encourages them. Did not see to-day half hour watching us?” (loud cheers Doctor); “and he is strong, true man, wise one too, public-school man too” (cheers), “and let us stick him, talk rot, drink his health head house.” (Loud cheers.) “And I have done blowing up, glad I done. But it is solemn thing thinking leaving place one lived loved eight years; one say word good old house time, why, said, whether bitter sweet. If I had not proud house you--ay, one knows proud--I should not blowing up. And let us get singing. But I sit I must give toast drunk three-times-three honours. It is toast I hope every one us, wherever he may go hereafter, never fail drink he thinks brave, bright days his boyhood. It is toast bind us together, who have gone who will come us here. It dear old School-house--the best house best school England!” My dear boys, old young, belonged, belong, schools houses, do not begin throwing poor little book room, abusing it, vowing you will read get point. I allow you have provocation it. But come now--would you, you, give fig fellow did not believe stand his house his school? You know would not. Then do not object cracking old School house, Rugby. Have not I right it, I am taking trouble writing true history benefits? If are not satisfied, go write history houses times, say know schools houses, provided it is true, I will read without abusing you. The last words hit audience weakest place. They altogether enthusiastic several parts old Brooke's speech; “the best house best school England” much all, carried even sporting drinking interests legs rapturous applause, (it hoped) resolutions lead new life remember old Brooke's words--which, however, did not altogether do, appear hereafter. But required old Brooke's popularity carry parts his speech--especially relating Doctor. For bigoted holders established forms customs, never foolish meaningless, English school-boys--at least, school-boys generation. We magnified heroes every boy left, looked upon awe reverence he revisited place year afterwards, his way Oxford Cambridge; happy boy remembered him, sure audience he expounded he used say, though sad enough stuff make angels, say head-masters, weep. We looked upon every trumpery little custom habit obtained School though law Medes Persians, regarded infringement variation sort sacrilege. And Doctor, man boy stronger liking old school customs good sensible, had, already hinted, come decided collision several neither one other. And old Brooke said, he came collision boys customs, nothing give take off; he said done, mistake it. And beginning pretty clearly understood. The boys felt strong man them, would things his way, had not yet learnt he wise loving man also. His personal character influence time make felt, except bigger boys he came directly contact; he looked upon great fear dislike great majority even his house. For he found School School-house state monstrous license misrule, still employed necessary unpopular work setting order strong hand. However, said, old Brooke triumphed, boys cheered Doctor. And songs came, healths boys leave, made speech, one flowery, another maudlin, third prosy, on, necessary recorded. Half-past nine struck middle performance “Auld Lang Syne,” obstreperous proceeding, immense amount standing one foot table, knocking mugs together shaking hands, without accompaniments seems impossible youths Britain take part famous old song. The under-porter School-house entered performance, bearing five six long wooden candlesticks lighted dips them, he proceeded stick holes part great tables he could get at; stood outside ring till end song, he hailed shouts. “Bill old muff, half-hour has not struck.” “Here, Bill, drink cocktail.” “Sing us song, old boy.” “Do not wish may get table?” Bill drank proffered cocktail unwillingly, putting empty glass, remonstrated. “Now gentlemen, there is ten minutes prayers, must get hall straight.” Shouts “No, no!” violent effort strike “Billy Taylor” third time. Bill looked appealingly old Brooke, got stopped noise. “Now then, lend hand, youngsters, get tables back; clear away jugs glasses. Bill's right. Open windows, Warner.” The boy addressed, sat long ropes, proceeded pull great windows, let clear, fresh rush night air, made candles flicker gutter, fires roar. The circle broke up, collaring his jug, glass, song-book; Bill pounced big table, began rattle away place outside buttery door. The lower-passage boys carried small tables, aided friends; all, standing great hall-table, knot untiring sons harmony made night doleful prolonged performance “God Save King.” His Majesty King William Fourth reigned us, monarch deservedly popular amongst boys addicted melody, he chiefly known beginning excellent slightly vulgar song much delighted,-- “Come, neighbours all, great small, Perform duties here, And loudly sing, 'Live Billy, king,' For bating tax upon beer.” Others learned songs also celebrated his praises sort ballad, I take written Irish loyalist. I forgotten chorus, ran,-- “God save good King William, Be his name ever blest; He is father his people, And guardian rest.” In troth loyal subjects days, rough way. I trust successors make much her present Majesty, and, regard greater refinement times, adopted written songs equally hearty, civilized, her honour. Then quarter ten struck, prayer-bell rang. The sixth fifth form boys ranged school order along wall, either side great fires, middle-fifth upper-school boys round long table middle hall, lower-school boys round upper part second long table, ran side hall farthest fires. Here Tom found bottom all, state mind body fit prayers, he thought; tried hard make serious, could not, life him, anything repeat his head choruses songs, stare boys opposite, wondering brilliancy waistcoats, speculating sort fellows were. The steps head-porter heard stairs, light gleams door. “Hush!” fifth-form boys stand there, strides Doctor, cap head, book one hand, gathering his gown other. He walks middle, takes his post Warner, begins calling names. The Doctor takes notice anything, quietly turns his book finds place, stands, cap hand finger book, looking straight his nose. He knows better one look, see nothing. To-night singing night, there is lots noise harm done--nothing beer drunk, nobody worse it, though look hot excited. So Doctor sees nothing, fascinates Tom horrible manner he stands there, reads psalm, deep, ringing, searching voice his. Prayers over, Tom still stares open-mouthed Doctor's retiring figure, he feels pull his sleeve, turning round, sees East. “I say, ever tossed blanket?” “No,” said Tom; “why?” “Because there will tossing to-night, likely, sixth come bed. So funk, come along hide, else they will catch toss you.” “Were ever tossed? Does hurt?” inquired Tom. “Oh yes, bless you, dozen times,” said East, he hobbled along Tom's side upstairs. “It do not hurt unless fall floor. But fellows do not like it.” They stopped fireplace top passage, crowd small boys whispering together, evidently unwilling go bedrooms. In minute, however, study door opened, sixth-form boy came out, scuttled stairs, noiselessly dispersed different rooms. Tom's heart beat rather quick he East reached room, he made his mind. “I shall not hide, East,” said he. “Very well, old fellow,” replied East, evidently pleased; “no shall I. They will us directly.” The room great big one, dozen beds it, boy Tom could see except East himself. East pulled his coat waistcoat, sat bottom his bed whistling pulling his boots. Tom followed his example. A noise steps heard passage, door opens, rush four five great fifth-form boys, headed Flashman his glory. Tom East slept farther corner room, seen first. “Gone ground, eh?” roared Flashman. “Push  them then, boys; look beds.” And he pulled little white curtain one nearest him. “Who-o-op!” he roared, pulling away leg small boy, held tight leg bed, sang lustily mercy. “Here, lend hand, one you, help pull young howling brute.--Hold tongue, sir, I will kill you.” “Oh, please, Flashman, please, Walker, do not toss me! I will fag you--I will anything--only do not toss me.” “You hanged,” said Flashman, lugging wretched boy along; “'twon't hurt you,--you!--Come along, boys; he is.” “I say, Flashey,” sang another big boys; “drop that; heard old Pater Brooke said to-night. I will hanged we will toss one will. No bullying. Let go, I say.” Flashman, oath kick, released his prey, rushed headlong his bed again, fear change minds, crept along underneath beds, till he got sixth-form boy, he knew dare not disturb. “There is plenty youngsters do not care it,” said Walker. “Here, here is Scud East--you will tossed, will not you, young un?” Scud East's nickname, Black, called it, gained his fleetness foot. “Yes,” said East, “if like, mind foot.” “And here is another did not hide.--Hullo! new boy; what is name, sir?” “Brown.” “Well, Whitey Brown, do not mind tossed?” “No,” said Tom, setting his teeth. “Come along then, boys,” sang Walker; away went, carrying along Tom East, intense relief four five small boys, crept beds behind them. “What trump Scud is!” said one. “They will not come back now.” “And new boy, too; he must good-plucked one.” “Ah! wait till he tossed floor; see he will like then!” Meantime procession went passage Number 7, largest room, scene tossing, middle great open space. Here joined parties bigger boys, captive two, willing tossed, sullen, frightened death. At Walker's suggestion afraid let off, honour Pater Brooke's speech. Then dozen big boys seized hold blanket, dragged one beds. “In Scud; quick! there is time lose.” East chucked blanket. “Once, twice, thrice, away!” Up he went like shuttlecock, quite ceiling. “Now, boys, will,” cried Walker; “once, twice, thrice, away!” This time he went clean up, kept touching ceiling his hand, third time, he turned out, went another boy. And came Tom's turn. He lay quite still, East's advice, did not dislike “once, twice, thrice;” “away” was not pleasant. They good wind now, sent slap ceiling first time, his knees came rather sharply. But moment's pause descending rub--the feeling utter helplessness leaving his whole inside behind sticking ceiling. Tom near shouting set he found back blanket, thought East, did not; took his three tosses without kick cry, called young trump his pains. He East, earned it, stood looking on. No catastrophe happened, captives cool hands, did not struggle. This did not suit Flashman. What real bully likes tossing boys kick struggle, hold one side blanket, get pitched bodily floor; it is fun one hurt frightened. “Let us toss two together, Walker,” suggested he. “What cursed bully are, Flashey!” rejoined other. “Up another one.” And two boys tossed together, peculiar hardship is, it is much human nature lie still share troubles; wretched pair small boys struggle air shall fall a-top descent, small risk falling blanket, huge delight brutes like Flashman. But there is cry praepostor room coming; tossing stops, scatter different rooms; Tom left turn in, first day's experience public school meditate upon. CHAPTER VII--SETTLING TO THE COLLAR. “Says Giles, 'It Is mortal hard go, But be's I must I means follow arter he As goes hisself fust.'”--Ballad. Everybody, I suppose, knows dreamy, delicious state one lies, half asleep, half awake, consciousness begins return sound night's rest new place glad in, following upon day unwonted excitement exertion. There pleasanter pieces life. The worst last short time; nurse will, lying perfectly passive mind body, cannot make five minutes them. After time stupid, obtrusive, wakeful entity call “I”, impatient he stiff-necked, spite teeth force back again, take possession us toes. It state Master Tom lay half-past seven morning following day his arrival, his clean little white bed watched movements Bogle (the generic name successive shoeblacks School-house known), he marched round bed bed, collecting dirty shoes boots, depositing clean ones places. There he lay, half doubtful exactly universe he was, conscious he made step life he anxious make. It light he looked lazily wide windows, saw tops great elms, rooks circling cawing remonstrances lazy ones commonwealth starting body neighbouring ploughed fields. The noise room-door closing behind Bogle, he made his exit shoebasket his arm, roused thoroughly, he sat bed looked round room. What world could matter his shoulders loins? He felt he severely beaten his back--the natural results his performance his first match. He drew his knees rested his chin them, went events yesterday, rejoicing his new life, he seen it, come. Presently one two boys roused themselves, began sit talk one another low tones. Then East, roll two, came anchor also, nodding Tom, began examining his ankle. “What pull,” said he, “that it is lie-in-bed, I shall lame tree, I think.” It Sunday morning, Sunday lectures yet established; nothing breakfast intervened bed eleven of the clock chapel--a gap means easy fill up: fact, though received correct amount grumbling, first lecture instituted Doctor shortly afterwards great boon School. It lie-in-bed, one hurry get up, especially rooms sixth-form boy good-tempered fellow, case Tom's room, allowed small boys talk laugh pretty much pleased, long did not disturb him. His bed bigger one rest, standing corner fireplace, washing-stand large basin side, he lay state his white curtains tucked form retiring place--an awful subject contemplation Tom, slept nearly opposite, watched great man rouse take book his pillow, begin reading, leaning his head his hand, turning his back room. Soon, however, noise striving urchins arose, muttered encouragements neighbouring boys “Go it, Tadpole!” “Now, young Green!” “Haul away his blanket!” “Slipper hands!” Young Green little Hall, commonly called Tadpole, his great black head thin legs, slept side side far away door, ever playing one another tricks, usually ended, morning, open violent collision; now, unmindful order authority, were, hauling away other's bedclothes one hand, other, armed slipper, belabouring whatever portion body his adversary came within reach. “Hold noise corner,” called praepostor, sitting looking round his curtains; Tadpole young Green sank disordered beds; then, looking his watch, added, “Hullo! past eight. Whose turn hot water?” (Where praepostor particular his ablutions, fags his room descend turn kitchen, beg steal hot water him; often custom extended farther, two boys went every morning get supply whole room.) “East's Tadpole's,” answered senior fag, kept rota. “I cannot go,” said East; “I am dead lame.” “Well, quick you, that is all,” said great man, he turned bed, putting his slippers, went great passage, runs whole length bedrooms, get his Sunday habiliments his portmanteau. “Let go you,” said Tom East; “I like it.” “Well, thank 'ee, that is good fellow. Just pull trousers, take jug mine. Tadpole show way.” And Tom Tadpole, nightshirts trousers, started downstairs, “Thos's hole,” little buttery, candles beer bread cheese served night, called, across School-house court, long passage, kitchen; where, parley stalwart, handsome cook, declared she filled dozen jugs already, got hot water, returned speed great caution. As was, narrowly escaped capture privateers fifth-form rooms, lookout hot-water convoys, pursued door room, making spill half load passage. “Better going though,” Tadpole remarked, “as beggars caught us.” By time calling-over bell rang, Tom his new comrades down, dressed best clothes, he satisfaction answering “here” his name first time, praepostor week put bottom his list. And came breakfast saunter close town East, whose lameness became severe fagging done. And whiled away time morning chapel. It fine November morning, close soon became alive boys ages, sauntered grass, walked round gravel walk, parties two three. East, still cicerone, pointed remarkable characters Tom passed: Osbert, could throw cricket-ball little-side ground rook-trees Doctor's wall; Gray, got Balliol scholarship, and, East evidently thought much importance, half-holiday School his success; Thorne, run ten miles two minutes hour; Black, held his cock town last row louts; many heroes, walked worshipped, trace long since vanished scene fame. And fourth-form boy reads names rudely cut old hall tables, painted upon big-side cupboard (if hall tables big-side cupboards still exist), wonders manner boys were. It wonder, sons, whatever prowess may cricket, scholarship, football. Two three years, less, steadily advancing, blessed wave pass names passed ours. Nevertheless, play games work manfully--see done--and let remembrance take care itself. The chapel-bell began ring quarter eleven, Tom got early took his place lowest row, watched boys come take places, filling row row; tried construe Greek text inscribed door slightest possible success, wondered masters, walked chapel took seats exalted boxes end, would his lord. And came closing doors, Doctor his robes, service, which, however, did not impress much, his feeling wonder curiosity strong. And boy one side scratching his name oak panelling front, he could not help watching see name was, whether well scratched; boy side went sleep, kept falling him; whole, though many boys even part school serious attentive, general atmosphere means devotional; he got close again, he did not feel comfortable, he church. But afternoon chapel quite another thing. He spent time dinner writing home his mother, better frame mind; his first curiosity over, he could attend service. As hymn prayers sung, chapel getting little dark, he beginning feel he really worshipping. And came great event his, every Rugby boy's life day--the first sermon Doctor. More worthy pens mine described scene--the oak pulpit standing School seats; tall, gallant form, kindling eye, voice, soft low notes flute, clear stirring call light-infantry bugle, stood Sunday Sunday, witnessing pleading his Lord, King righteousness love glory, whose Spirit he filled, whose power he spoke; long lines young faces, rising tier tier whole length chapel, little boy's left his mother young man's going next week great world, rejoicing his strength. It great solemn sight, never time year, lights chapel pulpit seats praepostors week, soft twilight stole rest chapel, deepening darkness high gallery behind organ. But it, all, seized held three hundred boys, dragging themselves, willing unwilling, twenty minutes, Sunday afternoons? True, always boys scattered School, heart head worthy hear able carry away deepest wisest words spoken. But minority always, generally small one, often small one countable fingers hand. What moved held us, rest three hundred reckless, childish boys, feared Doctor hearts, little besides heaven earth; thought sets School Church Christ, put traditions Rugby public opinion boys daily life laws God? We could not enter half heard; had not knowledge hearts knowledge one another, little enough faith, hope, love needed end. But listened, boys better moods listen (ay, men matter that), man felt be, his heart soul strength, striving whatever mean unmanly unrighteous little world. It cold, clear voice one giving advice warning serene heights struggling sinning below, warm, living voice one fighting us sides, calling us help one another. And so, wearily little little, surely steadily whole, brought home young boy, first time, meaning his life--that fool's sluggard's paradise he wandered chance, battlefield ordained old, spectators, youngest must take his side, stakes life death. And he roused consciousness showed time, every word he spoke pulpit, his whole daily life, battle fought, stood fellow-soldier captain band--the true sort captain, too, boy's army--one misgivings, gave uncertain word command, and, let would yield make truce, would fight fight (so every boy felt) last gasp last drop blood. Other sides his character might take hold influence boys there; thoroughness undaunted courage which, anything else, his way hearts great mass he left his mark, made believe first his Master. It quality others moved boys hero, nothing whatever remarkable except excess boyishness--by I mean animal life fullest measure, good nature honest impulses, hatred injustice meanness, thoughtlessness enough sink three-decker. And so, next two years, doubtful whether he would get good evil School, steady purpose principle grew him, whatever his week's sins shortcomings might been, he hardly ever left chapel Sunday evenings without serious resolve stand follow Doctor, feeling cowardice (the incarnation sins boy's mind) hindered his heart. The next day Tom duly placed third form, began his lessons corner big School. He found work easy, he well grounded, knew his grammar heart; and, he intimate companions make idle (East his School-house friends lower fourth, form him), soon gained golden opinions his master, said he placed low, put end half-year. So went well School, he wrote flourishing letters home his mother, full his success unspeakable delights public school. In house, too, went well. The end half-year drawing near, kept everybody good humour, house ruled well strongly Warner Brooke. True, general system rough hard, bullying nooks corners--bad signs future; never got farther, dared show openly, stalking passages hall bedrooms, making life small boys continual fear. Tom, new boy, right excused fagging first month, his enthusiasm his new life privilege hardly pleased him; East others his young friends, discovering this, kindly allowed indulge his fancy, take turns night fagging cleaning studies. These principal duties fags house. From supper nine of the clock three fags taken order stood passages, answered praepostor called “Fag,” racing door, last comer work. This consisted generally going buttery beer bread cheese (for great men sup rest, his allowance his study fifth-form room), cleaning candlesticks putting new candles, toasting cheese, bottling beer, carrying messages house; Tom, first blush his hero-worship, felt high privilege receive orders bearer supper old Brooke. And besides night-work, praepostor three four fags specially allotted him, he supposed guide, philosopher, friend, return good offices clean his study every morning turns, directly first lesson he returned breakfast. And pleasure seeing great men's studies, looking pictures, peeping books, made Tom ready substitute boy lazy his work. And he soon gained character good-natured, willing fellow, ready turn one. In games, too, he joined his heart, soon became well versed mysteries football, continual practice School-house little-side, played daily. The incident worth recording here, however, his first run hare-and-hounds. On last Tuesday one half-year he passing hall dinner, he hailed shouts Tadpole several fags seated one long tables, chorus was, “Come help us tear scent.” Tom approached table obedience mysterious summons, always ready help, found party engaged tearing old newspapers, copy-books, magazines, small pieces, filling four large canvas bags. “It is turn house find scent big-side hare-and-hounds,” exclaimed Tadpole. “Tear away; there is time lose calling-over.” “I think it is great shame,” said another small boy, “to hard run last day.” “Which run it?” said Tadpole. “Oh, Barby run, I hear,” answered other; “nine miles least, hard ground; chance getting finish, unless you are first-rate scud.” “Well, I am going try,” said Tadpole; “it is last run half, fellow gets end big-side stands ale bread cheese bowl punch; Cock's famous place ale.” “I like try too,” said Tom. “Well, then, leave waistcoat behind, listen door, calling-over, you will hear meet is.” After calling-over, sure enough two boys door, calling out, “Big-side hare-and-hounds meet White Hall;” Tom, girded leather strap, left superfluous clothing behind, set White Hall, old gable-ended house quarter mile town, East, he persuaded join, notwithstanding his prophecy could never get in, hardest run year. At meet found forty fifty boys, Tom felt sure, seen many run football, he East likely get they. After minutes' waiting, two well-known runners, chosen hares, buckled four bags filled scent, compared watches young Brooke Thorne, started long, slinging trot across fields direction Barby. Then hounds clustered round Thorne, explained shortly, “They are six minutes' law. We run Cock, every one comes within quarter hour hares'll counted, he round Barby church.” Then came minute's pause so, watches pocketed, pack led gateway field hares first crossed. Here break trot, scattering field find first traces scent hares throw go along. The old hounds make straight likely points, minute cry “Forward” comes one them, whole pack, quickening pace, make spot, boy hit scent first, two three nearest him, first fence, making play along hedgerow long grass-field beyond. The rest pack rush gap already made, scramble through, jostling one another. “Forward” again, half through. The pace quickens sharp run, tail hounds straining get lucky leaders. They gallant hares, scent lies thick right across another meadow ploughed field, pace begins tell; good wattle ditch side, large pasture studded old thorns, slopes first brook. The great Leicestershire sheep charge away across field pack comes racing slope. The brook small one, scent lies right ahead opposite slope, thick ever--not turn check favour tail hounds, strain on, trailing long line, many youngster beginning drag his legs heavily, feel his heart beat like hammer, bad-plucked ones thinking is not worth keep up. Tom, East, Tadpole good start, well young hands, rising slope crossing next field, find leading hounds, overrun scent, trying back. They come mile half eleven minutes, pace shows last day. About twenty-five original starters show here, rest already given in; leaders busy making casts fields left right, others get second winds. Then comes cry “Forward” young Brooke, extreme left, pack settles work steadily doggedly, whole keeping pretty well together. The scent, though still good, thick; need that, part run every one knows line must taken, casts made, good downright running fencing done. All mean coming in, come foot Barby Hill without losing two three pack. This last straight two miles half always vantage ground hounds, hares know well; generally viewed side Barby Hill, eyes lookout to-day. But sign appears, hard work hounds, nothing cast scent, hares' turn, may baffle pack dreadfully next two miles. Ill fares youngsters, School-house boys, follow young Brooke, he takes wide casts round left, conscious his powers, loving hard work. For would consider moment, small boys, would remember Cock, run ends good ale going, lies far right Dunchurch road, every cast take left much extra work. And stage run, evening closing already, one remarks whether run little cunning not; stick crafty hounds keep edging away right, follow prodigal like young Brooke, whose legs twice long cast-iron, wholly indifferent one two miles less. However, struggle him, sobbing plunging along, Tom East pretty close, Tadpole, whose big head begins pull down, thirty yards behind. Now comes brook, stiff clay banks, hardly drag legs, hear faint cries help wretched Tadpole, fairly stuck fast. But little run left pull brothers. Three fields more, another check, “Forward” called away extreme right. The two boys' souls die within them; never it. Young Brooke thinks too, says kindly, “You will cross lane next field; keep it, you will hit Dunchurch road Cock,” steams away run in, he is sure first, he starting. They struggle across next field, “forwards” getting fainter fainter, ceasing. The whole hunt ear-shot, hope coming over. “Hang all!” broke East, soon he got wind enough, pulling his hat mopping his face, spattered dirt lined sweat, went thick steam still, cold air. “I told would be. What thick I come! Here are, dead beat, yet I know we are close run in, knew country.” “Well,” said Tom, mopping away, gulping his disappointment, “it cannot helped. We best anyhow. Had not better find lane, go it, young Brooke told us?” “I suppose so--nothing else it,” grunted East. “If ever I go last day again.” Growl, growl, growl. So tried back slowly sorrowfully, found lane, went limping it, plashing cold puddly ruts, beginning feel run taken them. The evening closed fast, clouded over, dark, cold, dreary. “I say, must locking-up, I think,” remarked East, breaking silence--“it is dark.” “What we are late?” said Tom. “No tea, sent Doctor,” answered East. The thought did not add cheerfulness. Presently faint halloo heard adjoining field. They answered stopped, hoping competent rustic guide them, gate twenty yards ahead crawled wretched Tadpole, state collapse. He lost shoe brook, groping his elbows stiff, wet clay, miserable creature shape boy seldom seen. The sight him, notwithstanding, cheered them, he degrees wretched they. They also cheered him, he longer dread passing his night alone fields. And so, better heart, three plashed painfully never-ending lane. At last widened, utter darkness set in, came turnpike road, paused, bewildered, lost bearings, knew whether turn right left. Luckily decide, lumbering along road, one lamp lighted two spavined horses shafts, came heavy coach, moment's suspense recognized Oxford coach, redoubtable Pig Whistle. It lumbered slowly up, boys, mustering last run, caught passed, began clambering behind, exploit East missed his footing fell flat his nose along road. Then others hailed old scarecrow coachman, pulled agreed take shilling; sat back seat, drubbing heels, teeth chattering cold, jogged Rugby forty minutes locking-up. Five minutes afterwards three small, limping, shivering figures steal along Doctor's garden, house servants' entrance (all gates closed long since), first thing light upon passage old Thomas, ambling along, candle one hand keys other. He stops examines condition grim smile. “Ah! East, Hall, Brown, late locking-up. Must go Doctor's study once.” “Well but, Thomas, may not go wash first? You put time, know.” “Doctor's study d'rectly come in--that is orders,” replied old Thomas, motioning towards stairs end passage led Doctor's house; boys turned ruefully it, cheered old verger's muttered remark, “What pickle boys in!” Thomas referred faces habiliments, construed indicating Doctor's state mind. Upon short flight stairs paused hold counsel. “Who will go first?” inquires Tadpole. “You--you are senior,” answered East. “Catch me. Look state I am in,” rejoined Hall, showing arms his jacket. “I must get behind two.” “Well, look me,” said East, indicating mass clay behind he standing; “I am worse you, two one. You might grow cabbages trousers.” “That is below, keep legs behind sofa,” said Hall. “Here, Brown; you are show-figure. You must lead.” “But face muddy,” argued Tom. “Oh, we are one boat matter; come on; we are making worse, dawdling here.” “Well, give us brush then,” said Tom. And began trying rub superfluous dirt other's jackets; dry enough, rubbing made worse; despair pushed swing-door head stairs, found Doctor's hall. “That is library door,” said East whisper, pushing Tom forwards. The sound merry voices laughter came within, his first hesitating knock unanswered. But second, Doctor's voice said, “Come in;” Tom turned handle, he, others behind him, sidled room. The Doctor looked his task; he working away great chisel bottom boy's sailing boat, lines he doubt fashioning model one Nicias's galleys. Round stood three four children; candles burnt brightly large table farther end, covered books papers, great fire threw ruddy glow rest room. All looked kindly, homely, comfortable boys took heart moment, Tom advanced behind shelter great sofa. The Doctor nodded children, went out, casting curious amused glances three young scarecrows. “Well, little fellows,” began Doctor, drawing his back fire, chisel one hand his coat-tails other, his eyes twinkling he looked over; “what makes late?” “Please, sir, we have big-side hare-and-hounds, lost way.” “Hah! could not keep up, I suppose?” “Well, sir,” said East, stepping out, liking Doctor think lightly his running powers, “we got round Barby right; then--” “Why, state you are in, boy!” interrupted Doctor, pitiful condition East's garments fully revealed him. “That is fall I got, sir, road,” said East, looking himself; “the Old Pig came by--” “The what?” said Doctor. “The Oxford coach, sir,” explained Hall. “Hah! yes, Regulator,” said Doctor. “And I tumbled face, trying get behind,” went East. “You are hurt, I hope?” said Doctor. “Oh no, sir.” “Well now, run upstairs, three you, get clean things on, tell housekeeper give tea. You are young try long runs. Let Warner know I have seen you. Good-night.” “Good-night, sir.” And away scuttled three boys high glee. “What brick, give us even twenty lines learn!” said Tadpole, reached bedroom; half hour afterwards sitting fire housekeeper's room sumptuous tea, cold meat--“Twice good grub got hall,” Tadpole remarked grin, his mouth full buttered toast. All grievances forgotten, resolving go first big-side next half, thinking hare-and-hounds delightful games. A day two afterwards great passage outside bedrooms cleared boxes portmanteaus, went packed matron, great games chariot-racing, cock-fighting, bolstering went vacant space, sure sign closing half-year. Then came making parties journey home, Tom joined party hire coach, post four horses Oxford. Then last Saturday, Doctor came round form give prizes, hear master's last reports charges conducting themselves; Tom, his huge delight, praised, got his remove lower fourth, his School-house friends were. On next Tuesday morning four of the clock hot coffee going housekeeper's matron's rooms; boys wrapped great-coats mufflers swallowing hasty mouthfuls, rushing about, tumbling luggage, asking questions matron; outside School-gates drawn several chaises four-horse coach Tom's party chartered, postboys best jackets breeches, cornopean player, hired occasion, blowing away “A southerly wind cloudy sky,” waking peaceful inhabitants half-way High Street. Every minute bustle hubbub increased: porters staggered boxes bags, cornopean played louder. Old Thomas sat his den great yellow bag his side, he paying journey-money boy, comparing light solitary dip dirty, crabbed little list his handwriting Doctor's list amount his cash; his head one side, his mouth screwed up, his spectacles dim early toil. He prudently locked door, carried his operations solely window, he would driven wild lost his money. “Thomas, quick; shall never catch Highflyer Dunchurch.” “That is money right, Green.” “Hullo, Thomas, Doctor said I two pound ten; you have given two pound.” (I fear Master Green confining strictly truth.) Thomas turns his head one side ever, spells away dirty list. Green forced away window. “Here, Thomas--never mind him; mine's thirty shillings.” “And mine too,” “And mine,” shouted others. One way another, party Tom belonged got packed paid, sallied gates, cornopean playing frantically “Drops Brandy,” allusion, probably, slight potations musician postboys already indulging. All luggage carefully stowed away inside coach front hind boots, hat-box visible outside. Five six small boys, pea-shooters, cornopean player, got behind; front big boys, mostly smoking, pleasure, gentlemen large, correct public method notifying fact. “Robinson's coach road minute; gone Bird's pick up. We will wait till they are close, make race it,” says leader. “Now, boys, half sovereign apiece beat  them Dunchurch one hundred yards.” “All right, sir,” shouted grinning postboys. Down comes Robinson's coach minute two, rival cornopean, away go two vehicles, horses galloping, boys cheering, horns playing loud. There special providence school-boys well sailors, must upset twenty times first five miles--sometimes actually abreast one another, boys roofs exchanging volleys peas; nearly running post-chaise started them; half-way bank; wheel half yawning ditch: dark morning, nothing lamps guide them. However, it is last, run nothing old pig Southam Street. The last peas distributed Corn Market Oxford, arrive eleven twelve, sit sumptuous breakfast Angel, made pay accordingly. Here party breaks up, going different ways; Tom orders chaise pair grand lord, though he scarcely five shillings left his pocket, twenty miles get home. “Where to, sir?” “Red Lion, Farringdon,” says Tom, giving hostler shilling. “All right, sir.--Red Lion, Jem,” postboy; Tom rattles away towards home. At Farringdon, known innkeeper, he gets worthy pay Oxford horses, forward another chaise once; gorgeous young gentleman arrives paternal mansion, Squire Brown looks rather blue pay two pound ten shillings posting expenses Oxford. But boy's intense joy getting home, wonderful health he in, good character he brings, brave stories he tells Rugby, doings delights, soon mollify Squire, three happier people did not sit dinner day England (it boy's first dinner six of the clock home--great promotion already) Squire his wife Tom Brown, end his first half-year Rugby. CHAPTER VIII--THE WAR OF INDEPENDENCE. “They slaves choose Hatred, scoffing, abuse, Rather silence shrink From truth needs must think; They slaves dare In right two three.” --LOWELL, Stanzas Freedom. The lower-fourth form, Tom found beginning next half-year, largest form lower school, numbered upwards forty boys. Young gentlemen ages nine fifteen found there, expended part energies devoted Latin Greek upon book Livy, “Bucolics” Virgil, “Hecuba” Euripides, ground small daily portions. The driving unlucky lower-fourth must grievous work unfortunate master, unhappily constituted school. Here stuck great stupid boys, who, life them, could never master accidence--the objects alternately mirth terror youngsters, daily taking laughing lesson, getting kicked play-hours. There less three unhappy fellows tail coats, incipient chins, Doctor master form always endeavouring hoist upper school, whose parsing construing resisted well-meant shoves. Then came mass form, boys eleven twelve, mischievous reckless age British youth, East Tom Brown fair specimens. As full tricks monkeys, excuses Irishwomen, making fun master, one another, lessons, Argus would puzzled keep eye them; making steady serious half hour together, simply hopeless. The remainder form consisted young prodigies nine ten, going school rate form half-year, boys' hands wits progress. It would one man's work see precocious youngsters fair play; master good deal besides do, had not, ever shoved three four places, verses stolen, books inked, jackets whitened, lives otherwise made burden them. The lower-fourth, forms it, heard great school, trusted prepare lessons coming in, whipped school three-quarters hour lesson began respective masters, there, scattered benches, dictionary grammar, hammered twenty lines Virgil Euripides midst babel. The masters lower school walked great school together three-quarters hour, sat desks reading looking copies, keeping order possible. But lower-fourth overgrown form, large one man attend properly, consequently elysium ideal form young scapegraces formed staple it. Tom, said, come third good character, temptations lower-fourth soon proved strong him, he rapidly fell away, became unmanageable rest. For weeks, indeed, he succeeded maintaining appearance steadiness, looked upon favourably his new master, whose eyes first opened following little incident. Besides desk master occupied, another large unoccupied desk corner great school, untenanted. To rush seize upon desk, ascended three steps held four boys, great object ambition lower-fourthers; contentions occupation bred disorder last master forbade use altogether. This, course, challenge adventurous spirits occupy it; capacious enough two boys lie hid completely, seldom remained empty, notwithstanding veto. Small holes cut front, occupants watched masters walked down; lesson time approached, one boy time stole steps, masters' backs turned, mingled general crowd forms below. Tom East successfully occupied desk half-dozen times, grown reckless habit playing small games fives balls inside masters end big school. One day, ill-luck would it, game became exciting usual, ball slipped East's fingers, rolled slowly steps middle school, masters turned walk faced round upon desk. The young delinquents watched master, lookout holes, march slowly school straight upon retreat, boys neighbourhood, course, stopped work look on; ignominiously drawn out, caned hand there, characters steadiness gone time. However, shared fate three-fourths rest form, weigh heavily upon them. In fact, occasions cared matter monthly examinations, Doctor came round examine form, one long, awful hour, work done preceding month. The second monthly examination came round soon Tom's fall, anything lively anticipations he lower-fourth boys came prayers morning examination day. Prayers calling-over seemed twice short usual, could get construes tithe hard passages marked margin books, seated round, Doctor standing middle, talking whispers master. Tom could not hear word passed, never lifted his eyes his book; he knew sort magnetic instinct Doctor's under-lip coming out, his eye beginning burn, his gown getting gathered tightly his left hand. The suspense agonizing, Tom knew he sure occasions make example School-house boys. “If he would begin,” thought Tom, “I should not mind.” At last whispering ceased, name called Brown. He looked moment, Doctor's face awful; Tom would not met his eye he worth, buried his book again. The boy called first clever, merry School-house boy, one set; he connection Doctor's, great favourite, ran his house he liked, selected first victim. “Triste lupus stabulis,” began luckless youngster, stammered eight ten lines. “There, do,” said Doctor; “now construe.” On common occasions boy could construed passage well enough probably, his head gone. “Triste lupus, sorrowful wolf,” he began. A shudder ran whole form, Doctor's wrath fairly boiled over. He made three steps construer, gave good box ear. The blow hard one, boy taken surprise he started back; form caught back his knees, he went floor behind. There dead silence whole school. Never never Tom school Doctor strike boy lesson. The provocation must great. However, victim saved his form occasion, Doctor turned top bench, put best boys rest hour though, end lesson, he gave rating forget, terrible field-day passed without severe visitations shape punishments floggings. Forty young scapegraces expressed thanks “sorrowful wolf” different ways second lesson. But character steadiness gone easily recovered, Tom found; years afterwards he went school without it, masters' hands him, his them. And he regarded them, matter course, his natural enemies. Matters comfortable, either, house been; old Brooke left Christmas, one two others sixth-form boys following Easter. Their rule rough, strong main, higher standard beginning set up; fact, short foretaste good time followed years later. Just now, however, threatened return darkness chaos again. For new praepostors either small young boys, whose cleverness carried top school, strength body character yet fit share government; else big fellows wrong sort--boys whose friendships tastes downward tendency, caught meaning position work, felt none responsibilities. So no-government School-house began see bad times. The big fifth-form boys, sporting drinking set, soon began usurp power, fag little boys praepostors, bully oppress showed signs resistance. The bigger sort sixth-form boys described soon made common fifth, smaller sort, hampered colleagues' desertion enemy, could make head them. So fags without lawful masters protectors, ridden rough-shod set boys bound obey, whose right stood bodily powers; and, old Brooke prophesied, house degrees broke small sets parties, lost strong feeling fellowship he set much store by, much prowess games lead school matters he done much keep up. In place world individual character weight public school. Remember this, I beseech you, boys getting upper forms. Now time lives, probably, may wide influence good evil society live ever again. Quit like men, then; speak up, strike necessary, whatsoever true, manly, lovely, good report; never try popular, duty help others theirs, may leave tone feeling school higher found it, good living soul measure generations countrymen yet unborn. For boys follow one another herds like sheep, good evil; hate thinking, rarely settled principles. Every school, indeed, traditionary standard right wrong, cannot transgressed impunity, marking certain things low blackguard, certain others lawful right. This standard ever varying, though changes slowly little little; and, subject standard, leading boys time give tone rest, make School either noble institution training Christian Englishmen, place young boy get evil he would he turned make his way London streets, anything two extremes. The change worse School-house, however, did not press heavily youngsters time. They good bedroom, slept praepostor left able keep thorough order, study his passage. So, though fagged less, occasionally kicked cuffed bullies, were, whole, well off; fresh, brave school-life, full games, adventures, good-fellowship, ready forgetting, capacious enjoying, bright forecasting, outweighed thousand-fold troubles master form, occasional ill-usage big boys house. It was not till year events recorded praepostor room passage left. None sixth-form boys would move passage, and, disgust indignation Tom East, one morning breakfast seized upon Flashman, made carry his books furniture unoccupied study, he taken. From time began feel weight tyranny Flashman his friends, and, trouble come home doors, began look sympathizers partners amongst rest fags; meetings oppressed began held, murmurs arise, plots laid free avenged enemies. While matters state, East Tom one evening sitting study. They done work first lesson, Tom brown study, brooding, like young William Tell, upon wrongs fags general, his particular. “I say, Scud,” said he last, rousing snuff candle, “what right fifth-form boys fag us do?” “No right fag them,” answered East, without looking early number “Pickwick,” coming out, he luxuriously devouring, stretched his back sofa. Tom relapsed his brown study, East went reading chuckling. The contrast boys' faces would given infinite amusement looker-on--the one solemn big mighty purpose, radiant bubbling fun. “Do know, old fellow, I have thinking good deal,” began Tom again. “Oh yes, I know--fagging thinking of. Hang all! But listen here, Tom--here is fun. Mr. Winkle's horse--” “And I have made mind,” broke Tom, “that I will not fag except sixth.” “Quite right too, boy,” cried East, putting his finger place looking up; “but pretty peck troubles you will get into, you are going play game. However, I am strike myself, get others join. It is getting bad.” “Cannot get sixth-form fellow take up?” asked Tom. “Well, perhaps might. Morgan would interfere, I think. Only,” added East, moment's pause, “you see, tell it, that is School principles. Do not remember old Brooke said learning take parts?” “Ah, I wish old Brooke back again. It right his time.” “Why, yes, see, strongest best fellows sixth, fifth-form fellows afraid them, kept good order; sixth-form fellows small, fifth do not care them, like house.” “And get double set masters,” cried Tom indignantly--“the lawful ones, responsible Doctor rate, unlawful, tyrants, responsible nobody.” “Down tyrants!” cried East; “I am law order, hurrah revolution.” “I should not mind young Brooke now,” said Tom; “he is good-hearted, gentlemanly fellow, ought sixth. I would anything him. But blackguard Flashman, never speaks one without kick oath--” “The cowardly brute,” broke East--“how I hate him! And he knows too; he knows I think coward. What bore he is got study passage! Do not hear supper his den? Brandy-punch going, I will bet. I wish Doctor would come catch him. We must change study soon can.” “Change change, I will never fag again,” said Tom, thumping table. “Fa-a-a-ag!” sounded along passage Flashman's study. The two boys looked one another silence. It struck nine, regular night-fags left duty, nearest supper-party. East sat up, began look comical, he always difficulties. “Fa-a-a-ag!” again. No answer. “Here, Brown! East! cursed young skulks,” roared Flashman, coming his open door; “I know you are in; shirking.” Tom stole door, drew bolts noiselessly he could; East blew candle. “Barricade first,” whispered he. “Now, Tom, mind, surrender.” “Trust that,” said Tom his teeth. In another minute heard supper-party turn come passage door. They held breaths, heard whispering, made Flashman's words, “I know young brutes in.” Then came summonses open, unanswered, assault commenced. Luckily door good strong oak one, resisted united weight Flashman's party. A pause followed, heard besieger remark, “They are safe enough. Do not see door holds top bottom? So bolts must drawn. We forced lock long ago.” East gave Tom nudge, call attention scientific remark. Then came attacks particular panels, one last gave way repeated kicks; broke inwards, broken pieces got jammed across (the door lined green baize), could not easily removed outside: besieged, scorning concealment, strengthened defences pressing end sofa door. So, one two ineffectual efforts, Flashman Company retired, vowing vengeance mild terms. The first danger over, remained besieged effect safe retreat, near bed-time. They listened intently, heard supper-party resettle themselves, gently drew back first one bolt other. Presently convivial noises began steadily. “Now then, stand run,” said East, throwing door wide open rushing passage, closely followed Tom. They quick caught; Flashman lookout, sent empty pickle-jar whizzing them, narrowly missed Tom's head, broke twenty pieces end passage. “He would not mind killing one, he was not caught,” said East, turned corner. There pursuit, two turned hall, found knot small boys round fire. Their story told. The war independence broken out. Who would join revolutionary forces? Several others present bound fag fifth form once. One two edged off, left rebels. What else could do? “I have good mind go Doctor straight,” said Tom. “That will never do. Do not remember levy school last half?” put another. In fact, solemn assembly, levy School, held, captain School got up, premising several instances occurred matters reported masters; public morality School tradition; levy sixth held subject, resolved practice must stopped once; given boy, whatever form, thenceforth appeal master, without first gone praepostor laid case him, thrashed publicly, sent Coventry. “Well, then, let us try sixth. Try Morgan,” suggested another. “No use”--“Blabbing will not do,” general feeling. “I will give fellows piece advice,” said voice end hall. They turned round start, speaker got bench he lying unobserved, gave shake. He big, loose-made fellow, huge limbs grown far his jacket trousers. “Do not go anybody all--you stand out; say will not fag. They will soon get tired licking you. I have tried years ago forerunners.” “No! Did you? Tell us was?” cried chorus voices, clustered round him. “Well, you. The fifth form would fag us, I struck, beat  them. The good fellows left directly, bullies kept soon got afraid.” “Was Flashman then?” “Yes; dirty, little, snivelling, sneaking fellow he too. He never dared join us, used toady bullies offering fag them, peaching rest us.” “Why was not he cut, then?” said East. “Oh, toadies never get cut; they are useful. Besides, he end great hampers home, wine game them; he toadied fed favour.” The quarter-to-ten bell rang, small boys went upstairs, still consulting together, praising new counsellor, stretched bench hall fire again. There he lay, queer specimen boyhood, name Diggs, familiarly called “the Mucker.” He young his size, clever fellow, nearly top fifth. His friends home, regard, I suppose, his age, his size place school, had not put tails; even his jackets always small; he talent destroying clothes making look shabby. He was not terms Flashman's set, sneered his dress ways behind his back; he knew, revenged asking Flashman disagreeable questions, treating familiarly whenever crowd boys round him. Neither he intimate bigger boys, warned his oddnesses, he queer fellow; besides, amongst failings, he impecuniosity remarkable degree. He brought much money boys school, got rid time, one knew how; then, also reckless, borrowed one; his debts accumulated creditors pressed, would auction hall everything he possessed world, selling even his school-books, candlestick, study table. For weeks one auctions, rendered his study uninhabitable, he would live fifth-form room hall, his verses old letter-backs odd scraps paper, learning his lessons one knew how. He never meddled little boy, popular them, though looked sort compassion, called “Poor Diggs,” able resist appearances, disregard wholly even sneers enemy Flashman. However, he seemed equally indifferent sneers big boys pity small ones, lived his queer life much apparent enjoyment himself. It necessary introduce Diggs thus particularly, he Tom East good service present warfare, told, soon afterwards, he got sixth, chose his fags, excused study-fagging, thereby earning unto eternal gratitude interested history. And seldom small boys need friend, morning siege storm burst upon rebels violence. Flashman laid wait, caught Tom second lesson, receiving point-blank “No” told fetch his hat, seized twisted his arm, went methods torture use. “He could not make cry, though,” Tom said triumphantly rest rebels; “and I kicked his shins well, I know.” And soon crept lot fags league, Flashman excited his associates join bringing young vagabonds senses; house filled constant chasings, sieges, lickings sorts; return, bullies' beds pulled pieces drenched water, names written walls every insulting epithet fag invention could furnish. The war, short, raged fiercely; soon, Diggs told them, better fellows fifth gave trying fag them, public feeling began set Flashman his two three intimates, obliged keep doings secret, thorough bad fellows, missed opportunity torturing private. Flashman adept ways, power saying cutting cruel things, could often bring tears eyes boys way, thrashings world would not wrung them. And his operations cut short directions, he devoted chiefly Tom East, lived his door, would force study whenever he found chance, sit there, sometimes alone, sometimes companion, interrupting work, exulting evident pain every he could see he inflicting one other. The storm cleared air rest house, better state things began since old Brooke left; angry, dark spot thunder-cloud still hung end passage Flashman's study East Tom lay. He felt first rebels, rebellion great extent successful; stirred hatred bitterness his heart frequent collisions late openly called coward sneak. The taunts true forgiven. While he act thrashing them, would roar instances his funking football, shirking encounter lout half his size. These things well enough known house, his disgrace shouted small boys, feel despised him, unable silence amount torture, see open laugh sneer his associates (who looking on, took trouble hide scorn him, though neither interfered his bullying lived bit less intimately him), made beside himself. Come might, he would make boys' lives miserable. So strife settled personal affair Flashman youngsters--a war knife, fought little cockpit end bottom passage. Flashman, said, seventeen years old, big strong his age. He played well games pluck was not much wanted, managed generally keep appearances was; bluff, off-hand manner, passed heartiness, considerable powers pleasant he liked, went school general good fellow enough. Even School-house, dint his command money, constant supply good things he kept up, his adroit toadyism, he managed make tolerated, rather popular amongst his contemporaries; although young Brooke scarcely spoke him, one two others right sort showed opinions whenever chance offered. But wrong sort happened ascendant now, Flashman formidable enemy small boys. This soon became plain enough. Flashman left slander unspoken, deed undone, could way hurt his victims, isolate rest house. One one rebels fell away them, Flashman's prospered, several fifth-form boys began look black ill-treat passed house. By keeping bounds, events house quadrangle, day, carefully barring night, East Tom managed hold without feeling miserable; much could do. Greatly drawn towards old Diggs, who, uncouth way, began take good deal notice them, twice came study Flashman there, immediately decamped consequence. The boys thought Diggs must watching. When therefore, time, auction one night announced take place hall, which, amongst superfluities boys, Diggs's penates time going hammer, East Tom laid heads together, resolved devote ready cash (some four shillings sterling) redeem articles sum would cover. Accordingly, duly attended bid, Tom became owner two lots Diggs's things:--Lot 1, price one-and-threepence, consisting (as auctioneer remarked) “valuable assortment old metals,” shape mouse-trap, cheese-toaster without handle, saucepan: Lot 2, villainous dirty table-cloth green-baize curtain; East, one-and-sixpence, purchased leather paper-case, lock key, handsome, much worse wear. But still point settle get Diggs take things without hurting his feelings. This solved leaving his study, never locked he out. Diggs, attended auction, remembered bought lots, came study soon after, sat silent time, cracking his great red finger-joints. Then he laid hold verses, began looking altering them, last got up, turning his back them, said, “You are uncommon good-hearted little beggars, two. I value paper-case; sister gave last holidays. I will not forget.” And he tumbled passage, leaving somewhat embarrassed, sorry he knew done. The next morning Saturday, day allowances one shilling week paid--an important event spendthrift youngsters; great disgust amongst small fry hear allowances impounded Derby lottery. That great event English year, Derby, celebrated Rugby days many lotteries. It improving custom, I own, gentle reader, led making books, betting, objectionable results; great Houses Palaver think right stop nation's business day many members bet heavily themselves, blame us boys following example betters? At rate follow it. First great school lottery, first prize six seven pounds; house one separate lotteries. These nominally voluntary, boy compelled put his shilling did not choose so. But besides Flashman, three four fast, sporting young gentlemen Schoolhouse, considered subscription matter duty necessity; so, make duty come easy small boys, quietly secured allowances lump given distribution, kept them. It use grumbling--so many fewer tartlets apples eaten fives balls bought Saturday; locking-up, money would otherwise spent, consolation carried many small boy sound night-fags shouting along passages, “Gentlemen sportsmen School-house; lottery's going drawn hall.” It pleasant called gentleman sportsman, also chance drawing favourite horse. The hall full boys, head one long tables stood sporting interest, hat them, tickets folded up. One began calling list house. Each boy his name called drew ticket hat, opened it; bigger boys, drawing, left hall directly go back studies fifth-form room. The sporting interest drawn blanks, sulky accordingly; neither favourites yet drawn, come upper-fourth. So now, small boy came drew his ticket, seized opened Flashman, standers-by. But great favourite drawn comes Tadpole's turn, he shuffles draws, tries make off, caught, his ticket opened like rest. “Here are! Wanderer--the third favourite!” shouts opener. “I say, give ticket, please,” remonstrates Tadpole. “Hullo! do not hurry,” breaks Flashman; “what will sell Wanderer now?” “I do not want sell,” rejoins Tadpole. “Oh, do not you! Now listen, young fool: do not know anything it; horse use you. He will not win, I want hedge. Now, I will give half crown him.” Tadpole holds out, threats cajoleries length sells half one shilling sixpence--about fifth fair market value; however, he glad realize anything, and, he wisely remarks, “Wanderer may not win, tizzy safe anyhow.” East presently comes draws blank. Soon comes Tom's turn. His ticket, like others, seized opened. “Here then,” shouts opener, holding up--“Harkaway!--By Jove, Flashey, young friend's luck.” “Give ticket,” says Flashman, oath, leaning across table open hand his face black rage. “Would not like it?” replies opener, bad fellow bottom, admirer Flashman. “Here, Brown, catch hold.” And he hands ticket Tom, pockets it. Whereupon Flashman makes door once, Tom ticket may escape, keeps watch drawing boys gone, except sporting set five six, stay compare books, make bets, on; Tom, does not choose move Flashman door; East, stays his friend, anticipating trouble. The sporting set gathered round Tom. Public opinion would not allow actually rob his ticket, humbug intimidation he could driven sell whole part undervalue lawful. “Now, young Brown, come, what will sell Harkaway for? I hear he is not going start. I will give five shillings him,” begins boy opened ticket. Tom, remembering his good deed, moreover his forlorn state wishing make friend, accept offer, another cries out, “I will give seven shillings.” Tom hesitated looked one other. “No, no!” said Flashman, pushing in, “leave deal him; we will draw lots afterwards. Now sir, know me: you will sell Harkaway us five shillings, you will repent it.” “I will not sell bit him,” answered Tom shortly. “You hear now!” said Flashman, turning others. “He is coxiest young blackguard house. I always told so. We are trouble risk getting lotteries benefit fellows he.” Flashman forgets explain risk ran, he speaks willing ears. Gambling makes boys selfish cruel well men. “That is true. We always draw blanks,” cried one.--“Now, sir, shall sell half, rate.” “I will not,” said Tom, flushing his hair, lumping his mind his sworn enemy. “Very well then; let us roast him,” cried Flashman, catches hold Tom collar. One two boys hesitate, rest join in. East seizes Tom's arm, tries pull away, knocked back one boys, Tom dragged along struggling. His shoulders pushed mantelpiece, he held main force fire, Flashman drawing his trousers tight way extra torture. Poor East, pain even Tom, suddenly thinks Diggs, darts find him. “Will sell ten shillings?” says one boy relenting. Tom answers groans struggles. “I say, Flashey, he enough,” says boy, dropping arm he holds. “No, no; another turn'll it,” answers Flashman. But poor Tom done already, turns deadly pale, his head falls forward his breast, Diggs, frantic excitement, rushes hall East his heels. “You cowardly brutes!” he say, he catches Tom supports hall table. “Good God! he is dying. Here, get cold water--run housekeeper.” Flashman one two others slink away; rest, ashamed sorry, bend Tom run water, East darts housekeeper. Water comes, throw his hands face, he begins come to. “Mother!”--the words came feebly slowly--“it is cold to-night.” Poor old Diggs blubbering like child. “Where I?” goes Tom, opening his eyes, “Ah! I remember now.” And he shut his eyes groaned. “I say,” whispered, “we cannot good, housekeeper minute.” And one steal away. He stays Diggs, silent sorrowful, fans Tom's face. The housekeeper comes strong salts, Tom soon recovers enough sit up. There smell burning. She examines his clothes, looks inquiringly. The boys silent. “How he come so?” No answer. “There is bad work here,” she adds, looking serious, “and I shall speak Doctor it.” Still answer. “Had not better carry sick-room?” suggests Diggs. “Oh, I walk now,” says Tom; and, supported East housekeeper, goes sick-room. The boy held his ground soon amongst rest, fear lives. “Did he peach?” “Does she know it?” “Not word; he is stanch little fellow.” And pausing moment, he adds, “I am sick work; brutes we have been!” Meantime Tom stretched sofa housekeeper's room, East his side, she gets wine water restoratives. “Are much hurt, dear old boy?” whispers East. “Only back legs,” answers Tom. They indeed badly scorched, part his trousers burnt through. But soon he bed cold bandages. At first he feels broken, thinks writing home getting taken away; verse hymn he learned years ago sings his head, he goes sleep, murmuring,-- “Where wicked cease troubling, And weary rest.” But sound night's rest, old boy-spirit comes back again. East comes in, reporting whole house him; he forgets everything, except old resolve never beaten bully Flashman. Not word could housekeeper extract either them, though Doctor knew she knew morning, he never knew more. I trust believe scenes possible school, lotteries betting-books gone out; I writing schools time, must give evil good. CHAPTER IX--A CHAPTER OF ACCIDENTS. “Wherein I [speak] disastrous chances, Of moving accidents flood field, Of hair-breadth 'scapes.”--SHAKESPEARE. When Tom came back school couple days sick-room, he found matters much changed better, East led expect. Flashman's brutality disgusted even his intimate friends, his cowardice made plain house; Diggs encountered morning lottery, high words sides, struck him, blow returned. However, Flashey unused sort thing, lived awkward affairs before, and, Diggs said, fed toadied back favour again. Two three boys helped roast Tom came begged his pardon, thanked telling anything. Morgan sent him, inclined take matter warmly, Tom begged it; he agreed, Tom's promising come future--a promise which, I regret say, he did not keep. Tom kept Harkaway himself, second prize lottery, thirty shillings, he East contrived spend three days purchase pictures study, two new bats cricket-ball--all best could got--and supper sausages, kidneys, beef-steak pies rebels. Light come, light go; would not comfortable money pockets middle half. The embers Flashman's wrath, however, still smouldering, burst every sly blows taunts, felt had not quite done yet. It was not long, however, last act drama came, end bullying Tom East Rugby. They often stole hall nights, incited thereto partly hope finding Diggs talk him, partly excitement something rules; for, sad say, youngsters, since loss character steadiness form, got habit things forbidden, matter adventure,--just way, I fancy, men fall smuggling, sort reasons--thoughtlessness first place. It never occurred consider rules laid down: reason nothing them, looked upon rules sort challenge rule-makers, would rather bad pluck accept; again, lower parts school had not enough do. The work form could manage get pretty easily, keeping good enough place get regular yearly remove; much ambition beyond this, whole superfluous steam available games scrapes. Now, one rule house daily pleasure boys break supper fags, except three duty passages, remain studies nine of the clock; caught passages hall, one another's studies, liable punishments caning. The rule stricter observance; sixth spent evenings fifth-form room, library was, lessons learnt common. Every then, however, praepostor would seized fit district visiting, would make tour passages hall fags' studies. Then, owner entertaining friend two, first kick door ominous “Open here” effect shadow hawk chicken-yard: every one cut cover--one small boy diving sofa, another table, owner would hastily pull book two open them, cry meek voice, “Hullo, who is there?” casting anxious eye round see protruding leg elbow could betray hidden boys. “Open, sir, directly; it is Snooks.” “Oh, I am sorry; I did not know you, Snooks.” And well-feigned zeal door would opened, young hopeful praying beast Snooks might not heard scuffle caused his coming. If study empty, Snooks proceeded draw passages hall find truants. Well, one evening, forbidden hours, Tom East hall. They occupied seats fire nearest door, Diggs sprawled usual farther fire. He busy copy verses, East Tom chatting together whispers light fire, splicing favourite old fives bat sprung. Presently step came bottom passage. They listened moment, assured was not praepostor, went work, door swung open, walked Flashman. He did not see Diggs, thought good chance keep his hand in; boys did not move him, struck one them, make get his way. “What is for?” growled assaulted one. “Because I choose. You have business here. Go study.” “You cannot send us.” “Cannot I? Then I will thrash stay,” said Flashman savagely. “I say, two,” said Diggs, end hall, rousing resting his elbow--“you will never get rid fellow till lick him. Go him, you. I will see fair play.” Flashman taken aback, retreated two steps. East looked Tom. “Shall try!” said he. “Yes,” said Tom desperately. So two advanced Flashman, clenched fists beating hearts. They his shoulder, tough boys age, perfect training; he, though strong big, poor condition his monstrous habit stuffing want exercise. Coward he was, however, Flashman could not swallow insult this; besides, he confident easy work, faced boys, saying, “You impudent young blackguards!” Before he could finish his abuse, rushed him, began pummelling could reach. He hit wildly savagely; full force his blows did not tell--they near him. It long odds, though, point strength; another minute Tom went spinning backwards form, Flashman turned demolish East savage grin. But Diggs jumped table he seated himself. “Stop there,” shouted he; “the round's over--half-minute time allowed.” “What --- you?” faltered Flashman, began lose heart. “I am going see fair, I tell you,” said Diggs, grin, snapping his great red fingers; “'taint fair fighting one time.--Are ready, Brown? Time's up.” The small boys rushed again. Closing, saw, best chance, Flashman wilder flurried ever: he caught East throat, tried force back iron-bound table. Tom grasped his waist, remembering old throw he learned Vale Harry Winburn, crooked his leg inside Flashman's, threw his whole weight forward. The three tottered moment, went floor, Flashman striking his head form hall. The two youngsters sprang legs, he lay still. They began frightened. Tom stooped down, cried out, scared his wits, “He is bleeding awfully. Come here, East! Diggs, he is dying!” “Not he,” said Diggs, getting leisurely table; “it is sham; he is afraid fight out.” East frightened Tom. Diggs lifted Flashman's head, he groaned. “What is matter?” shouted Diggs. “My skull's fractured,” sobbed Flashman. “Oh, let run housekeeper!” cried Tom. “What shall do?” “Fiddlesticks! It is nothing skin broken,” said relentless Diggs, feeling his head. “Cold water bit rag's he will want.” “Let go,” said Flashman surlily, sitting up; “I do not want help.” “We are really sorry--” began East. “Hang sorrow!” answered Flashman, holding his handkerchief place; “you shall pay this, I tell you, you.” And he walked hall. “He cannot bad,” said Tom, deep sigh, much relieved see his enemy march well. “Not he,” said Diggs; “and you will see will not troubled more. But, I say, head's broken too; collar covered blood.” “Is though?” said Tom, putting his hand; “I did not know it.” “Well, mop up, you will jacket spoilt. And got nasty eye, Scud. You would better go bathe well cold water.” “Cheap enough too, we are done old friend Flashey,” said East, made upstairs bathe wounds. They done Flashman one sense, he never laid finger either again; whatever harm spiteful heart venomous tongue could them, he took care done. Only throw dirt enough, sure stick; fifth form bigger boys general, he associated less, all. Flashman managed get Tom East disfavour, wear time author disappeared School world. This event, much prayed small fry general, took place months encounter. One fine summer evening Flashman regaling gin-punch, Brownsover; and, exceeded his usual limits, started home uproarious. He fell friend two coming back bathing, proposed glass beer, assented, weather hot, thirsty souls, unaware quantity drink Flashman already board. The short result was, Flashey became beastly drunk. They tried get along, could not; chartered hurdle two men carry him. One masters came upon them, naturally enough fled. The flight rest raised master's suspicions, good angel fags incited examine freight, and, examination, convoy hurdle School-house; Doctor, long his eye Flashman, arranged his withdrawal next morning. The evil men boys lives them: Flashman gone, boys, hinted above, still felt effects his hate. Besides, movers strike unlawful fagging. The righteous--the result triumphant great extent; best fifth--even never fagged small boys, given practice cheerfully--could not help feeling small grudge first rebels. After all, form defied, grounds, doubt--so just, indeed, acknowledged wrong, remained passive strife. Had sided Flashman his set, rebels must given way once. They could not help, whole, glad acted, resistance successful form shown fight; felt law order gained thereby, ringleaders could not quite pardon once. “Confoundedly coxy young rascals get, do not mind,” general feeling. So is, must always, dear boys. If angel Gabriel come heaven, head successful rise abominable unrighteous vested interest poor old world groans under, he would certainly lose his character many years, probably centuries, upholders said vested interest, respectable mass people he delivered. They would not ask dinner, let names appear his papers; would careful spoke Palaver, clubs. What expect, then, poor gallant blundering men like Kossuth, Garibaldi, Mazzini, righteous causes triumph hands--men holes enough armour, God knows, easy hit respectabilities sitting lounging chairs, large balances bankers'? But brave, gallant boys, hate easy-chairs, balances bankers. You want heads set straight, take right side; bear mind majorities, especially respectable ones, nine times ten wrong; see man boy striving earnestly weak side, however wrong-headed blundering he may be, go join cry him. If cannot join help him, make wiser, rate remember he found something world he fight suffer for, got yourselves; think speak tenderly. So East Tom, Tadpole, one two more, became sort young Ishmaelites, hands every one, every one's hand them. It already told got war masters fifth form, sixth much same. They saw praepostors cowed joining fifth shirking duties; did not respect them, rendered willing obedience. It one thing clean studies sons heroes like old Brooke, quite another like Snooks Green, never faced good scrummage football, could not keep passages order night. So slurred fagging well enough escape licking, always that, got character sulky, unwilling fags. In fifth-form room, supper, matters often discussed arranged, names ever coming up. “I say, Green,” Snooks began one night, “is not new boy, Harrison, fag?” “Yes; why?” “Oh, I know something home, like excuse him. Will swop?” “Who give me?” “Well, let us see. There is Willis, Johnson. No, will not do. Yes, I it. There is young East; I will give him.” “Do not wish may get it?” replied Green. “I will give two Willis, like.” “Who, then?” asked Snooks. “Hall Brown.” “Would not  them gift.” “Better East, though; are not quite sharp,” said Green, getting leaning his back mantelpiece. He was not bad fellow, could not help able put unruly fifth form. His eye twinkled he went on, “Did I ever tell young vagabond sold last half?” “No; how?” “Well, he never half cleaned study out--only stuck candlesticks cupboard, swept crumbs floor. So last I mortal angry, up, made go whole performance eyes. The dust young scamp made nearly choked me, showed he had not swept carpet before. Well, finished, 'Now, young gentleman,' says I, 'mind, I expect done every morning--floor swept, table-cloth taken shaken, everything dusted.' 'Very well,' grunts he. Not bit though. I quite sure, day two, he never took table-cloth even. So I laid trap him. I tore paper, put half dozen bits table one night, cloth usual. Next morning breakfast I came, pulled cloth, and, sure enough, paper, fluttered floor. I towering rage. 'I have got now,' thought I, sent him, I got cane. Up he came cool please, his hands his pockets. 'Did not I tell shake table-cloth every morning?' roared I. 'Yes,' says he. 'Did morning?' 'Yes.' 'You young liar! I put pieces paper table last night, you would taken table-cloth you would seen them, I am going give good licking.' Then youngster takes one hand his pocket, stoops picks two bits paper, holds me. There written each, great round text, 'Harry East, his mark.' The young rogue found trap out, taken away paper, put his there, every bit ear-marked. I would great mind lick his impudence; but, all, one right laying traps, I did not. Of course I his mercy till end half, his weeks study frowzy I could not sit it.” “They spoil one's things so, too,” chimed third boy. “Hall Brown night-fags last week. I called 'fag,' gave candlesticks clean. Away went, did not appear again. When they would time enough clean three times over, I went look them. They were not passages I went hall, I heard music; I found sitting table, listening Johnson, playing flute, candlesticks stuck bars well fire, red-hot, clean spoiled. They have never stood straight since, I must get more. However, I gave good licking; that is one comfort.” Such sort scrapes always getting into; so, partly faults, partly circumstances, partly faults others, found outlaws, ticket-of-leave men, line--in short, dangerous parties--and lived sort hand-to-mouth, wild, reckless life parties generally put with. Nevertheless never quite lost favour young Brooke, cock house, getting sixth; Diggs stuck like man, gave store good advice, never least profited. And even house mended, law order restored, soon happened young Brooke Diggs got sixth, could not easily return paths steadiness, many old, wild, out-of-bounds habits stuck firmly ever. While quite little boys, scrapes got School had not much mattered one; upper school, wrong-doers sent straight Doctor once. So began come his notice; sort leaders small way amongst contemporaries, his eye, everywhere, upon them. It toss-up whether turned well ill, boys caused anxiety master. You told first occasion sent Doctor, remembrance pleasant much less fear boys standing had. “It is his look,” Tom used say East, “that frightens fellows. Do not remember, he never said anything us first half-year hour late locking-up?” The next time Tom came him, however, interview different kind. It happened time arrived, first series scrapes hero managed tumble. The river Avon Rugby slow clear stream, chub, dace, roach, coarse fish (or were) plentiful enough, together fair sprinkling small jack, fish worth sixpence either sport food. It is, however, capital river bathing, many nice small pools several good reaches swimming, within mile one another, easy twenty minutes' walk school. This mile water rented, used rented, bathing purposes trustees School, boys. The footpath Brownsover crosses river “the Planks,” curious old single-plank bridge running fifty sixty yards flat meadows side river--for winter frequent floods. Above Planks bathing-places smaller boys--Sleath's, first bathing-place, new boys begin, proved bathing men (three steady individuals, paid attend daily summer prevent accidents) could swim pretty decently, allowed go Anstey's, one hundred fifty yards below. Here hole six feet deep twelve feet across, puffing urchins struggled opposite side, thought small beer depths. Below Planks came larger deeper holes, first Wratislaw's, last Swift's, famous hole, ten twelve feet deep parts, thirty yards across, fine swimming reach right mill. Swift's reserved sixth fifth forms, spring board two sets steps: others one set steps each, used indifferently lower boys, though house addicted one hole another. The School-house time affected Wratislaw's hole, Tom East, learnt swim like fishes, found regular clock summer, always twice, often three times day. Now boys either had, fancied had, right also fish pleasure whole part river, would understand right (if any) extended Rugby side. As ill-luck would it, gentleman owned opposite bank, allowing time without interference, ordered his keepers let boys fish his side--the consequence first wranglings fights keepers boys; keen quarrel become landlord his keepers, ducking inflicted one latter, fierce fight ensued thereon, great school calling-over identify delinquents, Doctor five six masters could keep peace. Not even his authority could prevent hissing; strong feeling four praepostors week walked school canes, shouting “S-s-s-s-i-lenc-c-c-c-e” top voices. However, chief offenders time flogged kept bounds; victorious party brought nice hornet's nest ears. The landlord hissed School-gates he rode past, he charged his horse mob boys, tried thrash his whip, driven back cricket-bats wickets, pursued pebbles fives balls; wretched keepers' lives burden them, watch waters closely. The School-house boys Tom's standing, one all, protest tyranny cutting short lawful amusements, took fishing ways, especially means night-lines. The little tacklemaker bottom town would soon made his fortune rage lasted, several barbers began lay fishing-tackle. The boys great advantage enemies, spent large portion day nature's garb river-side, so, tired swimming, would get side fish, set night-lines, till keepers hove sight, plunge swim back mix bathers, keepers wise follow across stream. While things state, one day Tom three four others bathing Wratislaw's, had, matter course, taking re-setting night-lines. They left water, sitting standing toilets, costumes, shirt upwards, aware man velveteen shooting-coat approaching side. He new keeper, did not recognize notice him, till he pulled right opposite, began: “I see'd young gentlemen side a-fishing now.” “Hullo! you? What business yours, old Velveteens?” “I am new under-keeper, master's told keep sharp lookout young chaps. And I tells 'ee I means business, you would better keep side, shall fall out.” “Well, that is right, Velveteens; speak out, let us know mind once.” “Look here, old boy,” cried East, holding miserable, coarse fish two small jack; “would like smell  them see bank lived under?” “I will give bit advice, keeper,” shouted Tom, sitting his shirt paddling his feet river: “you would better go Swift's, big boys are; they are beggars setting lines, and'll put wrinkle two catching five-pounders.” Tom nearest keeper, officer, getting angry chaff, fixed his eyes hero, take note future use. Tom returned his gaze steady stare, broke laugh, struck middle favourite School-house song,-- “As I companions Were setting snare The gamekeeper watching us; For care: For wrestle fight, boys, And jump anywhere. For it is delight likely night, In season year.” The chorus taken boys shouts laughter, keeper turned away grunt, evidently bent mischief. The boys thought matter. But came May-fly season; soft, hazy summer weather lay sleepily along rich meadows Avon side, green gray flies flickered graceful, lazy up-and-down flight reeds water meadows, myriads upon myriads. The May-flies must surely lotus-eaters ephemerae--the happiest, laziest, carelessest fly dances dreams his hours sunshiny life English rivers. Every little pitiful, coarse fish Avon alert flies, gorging his wretched carcass hundreds daily, gluttonous rogues! every lover gentle craft avenge poor May-flies. So one fine Thursday afternoon, Tom, borrowed East's new rod, started river. He fished time small success--not fish would rise him; he prowled along bank, he presently aware mighty ones feeding pool opposite side, shade huge willow-tree. The stream deep here, fifty yards shallow, he made hot-foot; forgetting landlords, keepers, solemn prohibitions Doctor, everything else, pulled his trousers, plunged across, three minutes creeping along fours towards clump willows. It is not often great chub, coarse fish, earnest anything; thoroughly bent feeding, half hour Master Tom deposited three thumping fellows foot giant willow. As he baiting fourth pounder, going throw again, he became aware man coming bank one hundred yards off. Another look told under-keeper. Could he reach shallow him? No, carrying his rod. Nothing tree. So Tom laid his bones it, shinning fast he could, dragging his rod him. He time reach crouch along upon huge branch ten feet up, stretched river, keeper arrived clump. Tom's heart beat fast he came tree; two steps he would passed, when, ill-luck would it, gleam scales dead fish caught his eye, he made dead point foot tree. He picked fish one one; his eye touch told alive feeding within hour. Tom crouched lower along branch, heard keeper beating clump. “If I could get rod hidden,” thought he, began gently shifting get alongside him; “willowtrees do not throw straight hickory shoots twelve feet long, leaves, worse luck.” Alas! keeper catches rustle, sight rod, Tom's hand arm. “Oh, ther', 'ee?” says he, running tree. “Now come minute.” “Tree'd last,” thinks Tom, making answer, keeping close possible, working away rod, he takes pieces. “I am it, unless I starve out.” And he begins meditate getting along branch plunge, scramble side; small branches thick, opposite bank difficult, keeper lots time get round ford he get out, he gives up. And he hears keeper beginning scramble trunk. That never do; he scrambles back his branch joins trunk; stands lifted rod. “Hullo, Velveteens; mind fingers come higher.” The keeper stops looks up, grin says, “Oh! you, it, young measter? Well, here is luck. Now I tells 'ee come once, 't'll best 'ee.” “Thank 'ee, Velveteens; I am comfortable,” said Tom, shortening rod his hand, preparing battle. “Werry well; please yourself,” says keeper, descending, however, ground again, taking his seat bank. “I bean't hurry, may take time. I will l'arn 'ee gee honest folk names afore I have done 'ee.” “My luck usual,” thinks Tom; “what fool I give black! If I would called 'keeper,' now, I might get off. The return match his way.” The keeper quietly proceeded take his pipe, fill, light it, keeping eye Tom, sat disconsolately across branch, looking keeper--a pitiful sight men fishes. The he thought less he liked it. “It must getting near second calling-over,” thinks he. Keeper smokes stolidly. “If he takes up, I shall flogged safe enough. I cannot sit night. Wonder he will rise silver.” “I say, keeper,” said he meekly, “let go two bob?” “Not twenty neither,” grunts his persecutor. And sat till long past second calling-over, sun came slanting willow-branches, telling locking-up near hand. “I am coming down, keeper,” said Tom last, sigh, fairly tired out. “Now going do?” “Walk 'ee School, give 'ee Doctor; them's orders,” says Velveteens, knocking ashes his fourth pipe, standing shaking himself. “Very good,” said Tom; “but hands off, know. I will go quietly, collaring sort thing.” Keeper looked minute. “Werry good,” said he last. And Tom descended, wended his way drearily side keeper, Schoolhouse, arrived locking-up. As passed School-gates, Tadpole several others standing caught state things, rushed out, crying, “Rescue!” But Tom shook his head; followed Doctor's gate, went back sorely puzzled. How changed stern Doctor seemed last time Tom there, keeper told story, omitting state Tom called blackguard names. “Indeed, sir,” broke culprit, “it Velveteens.” The Doctor asked one question. “You know rule banks, Brown?” “Yes, sir.” “Then wait to-morrow, first lesson.” “I thought so,” muttered Tom. “And rod, sir?” went keeper. “Master's told might rods--” “Oh, please, sir,” broke Tom, “the rod is not mine.” The Doctor looked puzzled; keeper, good-hearted fellow, melted Tom's evident distress, gave his claim. Tom flogged next morning, days afterwards met Velveteens, presented half crown giving rod claim, became sworn friends; I regret say Tom many fish willow May-fly season, never caught Velveteens. It was not three weeks Tom, East his side, awful presence. This time, however, Doctor terrible. A days before, fagged fives fetch balls went court. While standing watching game, saw five six nearly new balls hit top School. “I say, Tom,” said East, dismissed, “could not get balls somehow?” “Let us try, anyhow.” So reconnoitred walls carefully, borrowed coal-hammer old Stumps, bought big nails, one two attempts, scaled Schools, possessed huge quantities fives balls. The place pleased much spent spare time there, scratching cutting names top every tower; last, exhausted places, finished inscribing H.EAST, T.BROWN, minute-hand great clock; held minute-hand, disturbed clock's economy. So next morning, masters boys came trooping prayers, entered quadrangle, injured minute-hand indicating three minutes hour. They pulled up, took time. When hour struck, doors closed, half school late. Thomas set make inquiry, discovers names minute-hand, reports accordingly; sent for, knot friends making derisive pantomimic allusions fate walk off. But Doctor, hearing story, does not make much it, gives thirty lines Homer learn heart, lecture likelihood exploits ending broken bones. Alas! almost next day one great fairs town; several rows disagreeable accidents late taken place occasions, Doctor gives out, prayers morning, boy go town. Wherefore East Tom, earthly pleasure except told do, start away, second lesson, making short circuit fields, strike back lane leads town, go it, run plump upon one masters emerge High Street. The master question, though clever, righteous man. He already caught several his pupils, gives lines learn, he sends East Tom, his pupils, Doctor, who, learning prayers morning, flogs soundly. The flogging good time, injustice captor rankling minds; end half, next evening one Thomas knocks door, says Doctor wants see them. They look one another silent dismay. What now? Which countless wrong-doings he heard officially? However, it is use delaying, go study. There find Doctor, angry, graver. “He sent speak seriously go home. They flogged several times half-year direct wilful breaches rules. This cannot go on. They good others, getting School, influence. They seem think rules made capriciously, pleasure masters; so. They made good whole School, must shall obeyed. Those thoughtlessly wilfully break allowed stay School. He sorry leave, School might much good, wishes think seriously holidays he said. Good-night.” And two hurry horribly scared; idea leave never crossed minds, quite unbearable. As go out, meet door old Holmes, sturdy, cheery praepostor another house, goes Doctor; hear his genial, hearty greeting newcomer, different reception, door closes, return study heavy hearts, tremendous resolves break rules. Five minutes afterwards master form--a late arrival model young master--knocks Doctor's study-door. “Come in!” And he enters, Doctor goes on, Holmes--“You see, I know anything case officially, I take notice all, I must publicly expel boy. I do not wish that, I think good him. There is nothing good sound thrashing.” He paused shake hands master, Holmes also, prepares leave. “I understand. Good-night, sir.” “Good-night, Holmes. And remember,” added Doctor, emphasizing words, “a good sound thrashing whole house.” The door closed Holmes; Doctor, answer puzzled look his lieutenant, explained shortly. “A gross case bullying. Wharton, head house, good fellow, slight weak, severe physical pain way deal case; I asked Holmes take up. He careful trustworthy, plenty strength. I wish sixth much. We must here, keep order all.” Now I do not want wiseacres read book, should, course prick long ears, howl, rather bray, story. Very good--I do not object; I add boys this, Holmes called levy his house breakfast next morning, made speech case bullying question, gave bully “good sound thrashing;” years afterwards, boy sought Holmes, thanked him, saying kindest act ever done upon him, turning-point his character; good fellow he became, credit his School. After talk them, Doctor said, “I want speak two boys form, East Brown. I speaking them. What think them?” “Well, hard workers, thoughtless full spirits; I cannot help liking them. I think sound, good fellows bottom.” “I am glad it. I think too: But make uneasy. They taking lead good deal amongst fags house, active, bold fellows. I sorry lose them, I shall not let stay I do not see gaining character manliness. In another year may great harm younger boys.” “Oh, I hope will not send away,” pleaded master. “Not I help it. But I never feel sure, half-holiday, I shall not flog one next morning, foolish, thoughtless scrape. I quite dread seeing either them.” They silent minute. Presently Doctor began again:-- “They do not feel duty work school, one make feel it?” “I think either little boy take care of, would steady them. Brown reckless two, I say. East would not get many scrapes without him.” “Well,” said Doctor, something like sigh, “I will think it.” And went talk subjects. PART II. “I [hold] truth, sings, To one clear harp divers tones, That men may rise stepping-stones Of dead selves higher things.” --TENNYSON. CHAPTER I--HOW THE TIDE TURNED. “Once every man nation comes moment decide, In strife Truth Falsehood, good evil side. . . . . Then brave man chooses, coward stands aside, Doubting his abject spirit, till his Lord crucified.” --LOWELL. The turning-point hero's school career come, manner follows. On evening first day next half-year, Tom, East, another School-house boy, dropped Spread Eagle old Regulator, rushed matron's room high spirits, real boys first get back, however fond may home. “Well, Mrs. Wixie,” shouted one, seizing methodical, active, little dark-eyed woman, busy stowing away linen boys already arrived several pigeon-holes, “here again, see, jolly ever. Let us help put things away.” “And, Mary,” cried another (she called indifferently either name), “who is come back? Has Doctor made old Jones leave? How many new boys there?” “Am I East Gray's study? You know promised get us could,” shouted Tom. “And I sleep Number 4?” roared East. “How is old Sam, Bogle, Sally?” “Bless boys!” cries Mary, last getting word; “why, you will shake death. There, now, go away housekeeper's room get suppers; know I have not time talk. You will find plenty house.--Now, Master East, let things alone. You are mixing three new boys' things.” And she rushed East, escaped round open trunks holding prize. “Hullo! look here, Tommy,” shouted he; “here is fun!” he brandished his head pretty little night-caps, beautifully made marked, work loving fingers distant country home. The kind mother sisters sewed delicate stitching aching hearts little thought trouble might bringing young head meant. The little matron wiser, snatched caps East he could look name them. “Now, Master East, I shall angry do not go,” said she; “there is capital cold beef pickles upstairs, I will not old boys room first night.” “Hurrah pickles! Come along, Tommy--come along, Smith. We shall find young count is, I will bound. I hope he will sleep room. Mary's always vicious first week.” As boys turned leave room, matron touched Tom's arm, said, “Master Brown, please stop minute; I want speak you.” “Very well, Mary. I will come minute, East. Do not finish pickles.” “O Master Brown,” went little matron, rest gone, “you are Gray's study, Mrs. Arnold says. And she wants take young gentleman. He is new boy, thirteen years old though he do not look it. He is delicate, never home before. And I told Mrs. Arnold I thought you would kind him, see do not bully first. He is put form, I have given bed next Number 4; East cannot sleep half.” Tom rather put speech. He got double study he coveted, conditions attached greatly moderated his joy. He looked across room, far corner sofa aware slight, pale boy, large blue eyes light fair hair, seemed ready shrink floor. He saw glance little stranger boy whose first half-year public school would misery he left alone, constant anxiety one meant see his troubles. Tom honest take youngster, let shift himself; he took his chum instead East, his pet plans bottled-beer cellar his window, making night-lines slings, plotting expeditions Brownsover Mills Caldecott's Spinney? East he made minds get study, every night locking-up till ten would together talk fishing, drink bottled-beer, read Marryat's novels, sort birds' eggs. And new boy would likely never go close, would afraid wet feet, always getting laughed at, called Molly, Jenny, derogatory feminine nickname. The matron watched moment, saw passing his mind, so, like wise negotiator, threw appeal his warm heart. “Poor little fellow,” said she, almost whisper; “his father's dead, he is got brothers. And his mamma--such kind, sweet lady--almost broke her heart leaving morning; she said one his sisters like die decline, so--” “Well, well,” burst Tom, something like sigh effort, “I suppose I must give East.--Come along, young un. What is name? We will go supper, I will show study.” “His name's George Arthur,” said matron, walking Tom, grasped his little delicate hand proper preliminary making chum him, felt he could blown away. “I have his books things put study, his mamma new papered, sofa covered, new green-baize curtains door” (the diplomatic matron threw in, show new boy contributing largely partnership comforts). “And Mrs. Arnold told say,” she added, “that she like come tea her. You know way, Master Brown, things gone up, I know.” Here announcement Master Tom! He go tea first night, he sixth fifth form boy, importance School world, instead reckless young scapegrace amongst fags. He felt lifted higher social moral platform once. Nevertheless he could not give without sigh idea jolly supper housekeeper's room East rest, rush round studies his friends afterwards, pour deeds wonders holidays, plot fifty plans coming half-year, gather news left new boys come, got who is study, new praepostors slept. However, Tom consoled thinking he could not done new boy his heels, marched along passages Doctor's private house his young charge tow, monstrous good-humour world. It needless, would impertinent, tell two young boys received drawing-room. The lady presided still living, carried her her peaceful home north respect love ever felt shared gentle high-bred hospitality. Ay, many brave heart, work bearing load country curacies, London chambers, Indian sun, Australian towns clearings, looks back fond grateful memory School-house drawing-room, dates much highest best training lessons learnt there. Besides Mrs. Arnold one two elder children, one younger masters, young Brooke (who sixth, succeeded his brother's position influence), another sixth-form boy, talking together fire. The master young Brooke, great strapping fellow six feet high, eighteen years old, powerful coal-heaver, nodded kindly Tom, his intense glory, went talking. The notice them. The hostess, kind words, led boys insensibly feel ease begin talking one another, left her children she finished letter. The young ones got fast well, Tom holding forth prodigious pony he riding hunting, hearing stories winter glories lakes, tea came in, immediately Doctor himself. How frank, kind, manly his greeting party fire! It Tom's heart good see young Brooke shake hands, look one another face; he did not fail remark Brooke nearly tall quite broad Doctor. And his cup full another moment his master turned another warm shake hand, and, seemingly oblivious late scrapes he getting into, said, “Ah, Brown, here! I hope left father well home?” “Yes, sir, quite well.” “And little fellow share study. Well, he does not look like see him. He wants Rugby air, cricket. And must take good long walks, Bilton Grange, Caldecott's Spinney, show little pretty country here.” Tom wondered Doctor knew his visits Bilton Grange purpose taking rooks' nests (a proceeding strongly discountenanced owner thereof), Caldecott's Spinney prompted chiefly conveniences setting night-lines. What did not Doctor know? And noble use he always made it! He almost resolved abjure rook-pies night-lines ever. The tea went merrily off, Doctor talking holiday doings, prospects half-year--what chance Balliol scholarship, whether eleven would good one. Everybody his ease, everybody felt he, young he might be, use little School world, work there. Soon tea Doctor went his study, young boys minutes afterwards took leave went private door led Doctor's house middle passage. At fire, farther end passage, crowd boys loud talk laughter. There sudden pause door opened, great shout greeting, Tom recognized marching passage. “Hullo, Brown! come from?” “Oh, I have tea Doctor,” says Tom, great dignity. “My eye!” cried East, “Oh! that is Mary called back, did not come supper. You lost something. That beef pickles end good.” “I say, young fellow,” cried Hall, detecting Arthur catching collar, “what is name? Where come from? How old you?” Tom saw Arthur shrink back look scared group turned him, thought best let answer, standing his side support case need. “Arthur, sir. I come Devonshire.” “Do not call 'sir,' young muff. How old you?” “Thirteen.” “Can sing?” The poor boy trembling hesitating. Tom struck in--“You hanged, Tadpole. He will sing, whether he not, Saturday twelve weeks, that is long enough yet.” “Do know home, Brown?” “No; he is chum Gray's old study, it is near prayer-time, I have not look yet.--Come along, Arthur.” Away went two, Tom longing get his charge safe cover, he might advise his deportment. “What queer chum Tom Brown,” comment fire; must confessed thought Tom himself, he lighted his candle, surveyed new green-baize curtains carpet sofa much satisfaction. “I say, Arthur, brick mother make us cozy! But look now; must answer straight fellows speak you, do not afraid. If you are afraid, you will get bullied. And do not say sing; do not ever talk home, mother sisters.” Poor little Arthur looked ready cry. “But, please,” said he, “may not I talk about--about home you?” “Oh yes; I like it. But do not talk boys do not know, they will call home-sick, mamma's darling, stuff. What jolly desk! Is yours? And stunning binding! Why, school-books look like novels.” And Tom soon deep Arthur's goods chattels, new, good enough fifth-form boy, hardly thought his friends outside till prayer-bell rang. I already described School-house prayers. They first night nights, save gaps caused absence boys came late, line new boys stood together farther table--of sorts sizes, like young bears troubles come, Tom's father said he position. He thought he looked line, poor little slight Arthur standing them, he leading upstairs Number 4, directly prayers, showing his bed. It huge, high, airy room, two large windows looking School close. There twelve beds room. The one farthest corner fireplace, occupied sixth-form boy, responsible discipline room, rest boys lower-fifth junior forms, fags (for fifth-form boys, said, slept rooms themselves). Being fags, eldest sixteen years old, bound bed ten. The sixth-form boys came bed ten quarter-past (at time old verger came round put candles out), except sat read. Within minutes therefore entry, boys slept Number 4 come up. The little fellows went quietly beds, began undressing, talking whispers; elder, amongst Tom, sat chatting one another's beds, jackets waistcoats off. Poor little Arthur overwhelmed novelty his position. The idea sleeping room strange boys clearly never crossed his mind before, painful strange him. He could hardly bear take his jacket off; however, presently, effort, came, he paused looked Tom, sitting bottom his bed talking laughing. “Please, Brown,” he whispered, “may I wash face hands?” “Of course, like,” said Tom, staring; “that is washhand-stand, window, second bed. You will go water morning use all.” And he went his talk, Arthur stole timidly beds his washhand-stand, began his ablutions, thereby drawing moment attention room. On went talk laughter. Arthur finished his washing undressing, put his night-gown. He looked round nervously ever. Two three little boys already bed, sitting chins knees. The light burned clear, noise went on. It trying moment poor little lonely boy; however, time he did not ask Tom he might might do, dropped his knees his bedside, he done every day his childhood, open his heart Him heareth cry beareth sorrows tender child, strong man agony. Tom sitting bottom his bed unlacing his boots, his back towards Arthur, he did not see happened, looked wonder sudden silence. Then two three boys laughed sneered, big, brutal fellow standing middle room picked slipper, shied kneeling boy, calling snivelling young shaver. Then Tom saw whole, next moment boot he pulled flew straight head bully, time throw his arm catch his elbow. “Confound you, Brown! what is for?” roared he, stamping pain. “Never mind I mean,” said Tom, stepping floor, every drop blood his body tingling; “if fellow wants boot, he knows get it.” What would result doubtful, moment sixth-form boy came in, another word could said. Tom rest rushed bed finished unrobing there, old verger, punctual clock, put candle another minute, toddled next room, shutting door his usual “Good-night, gen'lm'n.” There many boys room little scene taken heart slept. But sleep seemed deserted pillow poor Tom. For time his excitement, flood memories chased one another his brain, kept thinking resolving. His head throbbed, his heart leapt, he could hardly keep springing bed rushing room. Then thought his mother came across him, promise he made her knee, years ago, never forget kneel his bedside, give his Father, he laid his head pillow, might never rise; he lay gently, cried his heart would break. He fourteen years old. It light act courage days, dear boys, little fellow say his prayers publicly, even Rugby. A years later, Arnold's manly piety begun leaven School, tables turned; he died, School-house least, I believe house, rule way. But poor Tom come school times. The first nights he came he kneel noise, sat bed till candle out, stole said his prayers, fear lest one find out. So many another poor little fellow. Then he began think he might well say his prayers bed, did not matter whether he kneeling, sitting, lying down. And come pass Tom, confess Lord men; last year he probably said his prayers earnest dozen times. Poor Tom! first bitterest feeling like break his heart sense his cowardice. The vice others he loathed brought burnt his soul. He lied his mother, his conscience, his God. How could he bear it? And poor little weak boy, he pitied almost scorned his weakness, done he, braggart he was, dared do. The first dawn comfort came swearing he would stand boy thick thin, cheer him, help him, bear his burdens good deed done night. Then he resolved write home next day tell his mother all, coward her son been. And peace came he resolved, lastly, bear his testimony next morning. The morning would harder night begin with, he felt he could afford let one chance slip. Several times he faltered, devil showed first his old friends calling “Saint” “Square-toes,” dozen hard names, whispered his motives would misunderstood, he would left alone new boy; whereas his duty keep means influence, he might good largest number. And came subtle temptation, “Shall I showing braver others this? Have I right begin now? Ought I rather pray study, letting boys know I so, trying lead it, public least I go I done?” However, his good angel strong night, he turned his side slept, tired trying reason, resolved follow impulse strong, he found peace. Next morning he washed dressed, his jacket waistcoat, ten minutes' bell began ring, face whole room knelt pray. Not five words could he say--the bell mocked him; he listening every whisper room--what thinking him? He ashamed go kneeling, ashamed rise his knees. At last, his inmost heart, still, small voice seemed breathe forth words publican, “God merciful sinner!” He repeated over, clinging his life, rose his knees comforted humbled, ready face whole world. It needed: two boys besides Arthur already followed his example, he went great School glimmering another lesson his heart--the lesson he conquered his coward spirit conquered whole outward world; one old prophet learnt cave Mount Horeb, he hid his face, still, small voice asked, “What doest thou here, Elijah?” however may fancy alone side good, King Lord men nowhere without His witnesses; every society, however seemingly corrupt godless, bowed knee Baal. He found, too, greatly he exaggerated effect produced his act. For nights sneer laugh he knelt down, passed soon, one one boys three four followed lead. I fear measure owing fact Tom could probably thrashed boy room except praepostor; rate, every boy knew he would try upon slight provocation, did not choose run risk hard fight Tom Brown taken fancy say his prayers. Some small boys Number 4 communicated new state things chums, several rooms poor little fellows tried on--in one instance so, praepostor heard interfered decidedly, partial success; rest, short struggle, confessors bullied laughed down, old state things went time longer. Before either Tom Brown Arthur left School-house, room become regular custom. I trust still, old heathen state things gone ever. CHAPTER II--THE NEW BOY. “And Heaven's rich instincts grew As effortless woodland nooks Send violets paint blue.”--LOWELL. I mean recount little troubles annoyances thronged upon Tom beginning half-year, his new character bear-leader gentle little boy straight home. He seemed become new boy again, without long-suffering meekness indispensable supporting character moderate success. From morning till night he feeling responsibility his mind, even he left Arthur study close hour, never ease till he sight again. He waited doors school every lesson every calling-over; watched tricks played him, none regulation questions asked; kept his eye his plate dinner breakfast, see unfair depredations made upon his viands; short, East remarked, cackled like hen one chick. Arthur took long time thawing, too, made harder work; sadly timid; scarcely ever spoke unless Tom spoke first; and, worst all, would agree everything--the hardest thing world Brown bear. He got quite angry sometimes, sat together night study, provoking habit agreement, point breaking dozen times lecture upon propriety fellow his speaking out, managed restrain thought he might frighten Arthur, remembrance lesson he learnt his first night Number 4. Then he would resolve sit still say word till Arthur began; he always beat game, presently begin talking despair, fearing lest Arthur might think he vexed something he did not, dog-tired sitting tongue-tied. It hard work. But Tom taken up, meant stick it, go satisfy himself; resolution he much assisted chafing East his old friends, began call “dry-nurse,” otherwise break small wit him. But took ground, every then, Tom sorely puzzled. “Tell what, Tommy,” East would say; “you will spoil young Hopeful much coddling. Why cannot let go find his level? He will never worth button go keeping skirts.” “Well, he are not fit fight his way yet; I am trying get every day, he is odd. Poor little beggar! I cannot make bit. He are not bit like anything I have ever seen heard of--he seems nerves; anything say seems hurt like cut blow.” “That sort boy's use here,” said East; “he will spoil. Now I will tell do, Tommy. Go get nice large band-box made, put plenty cotton-wool pap-bottle, labelled 'With care--this side up,' send back mamma.” “I think I shall make hand though,” said Tom, smiling, “say will. There is something him, every then, shows he is got pluck somewhere him. That is thing that will wash, are not it, old Scud? But get bring out?” Tom took one hand his breeches-pocket stuck his back hair scratch, giving his hat tilt his nose, his one method invoking wisdom. He stared ground ludicrously puzzled look, presently looked met East's eyes. That young gentleman slapped back, put his arm round his shoulder, strolled quadrangle together. “Tom,” said he, “blest are not best old fellow ever was. I like see go thing. Hang it, I wish I could take things do; I never get higher joke. Everything's joke. If I going flogged next minute, I blue funk, I could not help laughing life me.” “Brown East, go fag Jones great fives court.” “Hullo, though, that is past joke,” broke East, springing young gentleman addressed them, catching collar.--“Here, Tommy, catch hold t'other side he holla.” The youth seized, dragged, struggling, quadrangle School-house hall. He one miserable little pretty white-handed, curly-headed boys, petted pampered big fellows, wrote verses them, taught drink use bad language, could spoil everything * world next. One avocations young gentlemen took particular delight going getting fags protectors, heroes playing game. They carried pencil paper them, putting names boys sent, always sending five times many wanted, getting thrashed did not go. The present youth belonged house jealous School-house, always picked School-house fags he could find them. However, time he would got wrong sow ear. His captors slammed great door hall, East put his back it, Tom gave prisoner shake up, took away his list, stood floor, he proceeded leisurely examine document. * A kind wise critic, old Rugboean, notes margin: “The small friend system utterly bad 1841-1847.” Before that, too, many noble friendships big little boys; I cannot strike passage. Many boys know left in. “Let out, let go!” screamed boy, furious passion. “I will go tell Jones minute, he will give --- thrashing ever had.” “Pretty little dear,” said East, patting top his hat.--“Hark he swears, Tom. Nicely brought young man, are not he, I do not think.” “Let alone, --- you,” roared boy, foaming rage, kicking East, quietly tripped up, deposited floor place safety. “Gently, young fellow,” said he; “'tain't improving little whippersnappers like indulging blasphemy; stop that, you will get something will not like.” “I will licked I get out, I will,” rejoined boy, beginning snivel. “Two play game, mind you,” said Tom, finished his examination list. “Now listen here. We have come across fives court, Jones four fags already--two he wants. If he would wanted us change, he would stopped us himself. And here, little blackguard, you have got seven names list besides ours, five School-house.” Tom walked him, jerked his legs; he time whining like whipped puppy. “Now listen me. We are not going fag Jones. If tell you have sent us, we will us give thrashing you will remember.” And Tom tore list threw pieces fire. “And mind you, too,” said East, “do not let catch sneaking School-house, picking fags. You have not got sort hide take sound licking kindly.” And he opened door sent young gentleman flying quadrangle parting kick. “Nice boy, Tommy,” said East, shoving his hands his pockets, strolling fire. “Worst sort breed,” responded Tom, following his example. “Thank goodness, big fellow ever took petting me.” “You would never like that,” said East. “I like put museum: Christian young gentleman, nineteenth century, highly educated. Stir long pole, Jack, hear swear like drunken sailor. He would make respectable public open eyes, I think.” “Think he will tell Jones?” said Tom. “No,” said East. “Do not care he does.” “Nor I,” said Tom. And went back talk Arthur. The young gentleman brains enough tell Jones, reasoning East Brown, noted toughest fags School, would not care three straws licking Jones might give them, would likely keep words passing interest. After conversation, East came good deal study, took notice Arthur, soon allowed Tom he thorough little gentleman, would get his shyness good time; much comforted hero. He felt every day, too, value object his life--something drew himself; dull time year, games going he much cared, happier he ever yet school, saying great deal. The time Tom allowed away his charge locking-up till supper-time. During hour hour half he used take his fling, going round studies his acquaintance, sparring gossiping hall, jumping old iron-bound tables, carving bit his name them, joining chorus merry voices--in fact, blowing his steam, call it. This process congenial his temper, Arthur showed pleased arrangement, several weeks Tom ever study supper. One evening, however, he rushed look old chisel, corks, article essential his pursuit time being, rummaging cupboards, looked moment, caught figure poor little Arthur. The boy sitting his elbows table, his head leaning his hands, open book, his tears falling fast. Tom shut door once, sat sofa Arthur, putting his arm round his neck. “Why, young un, what is matter?” said he kindly; “you are not unhappy, you?” “Oh no, Brown,” said little boy, looking great tears his eyes; “you kind me, I am happy.” “Why do not call Tom? Lots boys I do not like half much you. What reading, then? Hang it! must come me, mope yourself.” And Tom cast his eyes book, saw Bible. He silent minute, thought himself, “Lesson Number 2, Tom Brown;” said gently, “I am glad see this, Arthur, ashamed I do not read Bible myself. Do read every night supper I am out?” “Yes.” “Well, I wish you would wait till afterwards, we would read together. But, Arthur, make cry?” “Oh, is not I am unhappy. But home, father alive, always read lessons tea; I love read now, try remember he said them. I cannot remember I think I scarcely understand great deal I remember. But comes back fresh I cannot help crying sometimes think I shall never read him.” Arthur never spoken his home before, Tom had not encouraged so, his blundering schoolboy reasoning made think Arthur would softened less manly thinking home. But he fairly interested, forgot chisels bottled beer; little encouragement Arthur launched his home history, prayer-bell put sadly rang call hall. From time Arthur constantly spoke his home, all, his father, dead year, whose memory Tom soon got love reverence almost much his son did. Arthur's father clergyman parish Midland counties, risen large town war, upon hard years followed fallen fearful weight. The trade half ruined; came old, sad story, masters reducing establishments, men turned wandering about, hungry wan body, fierce soul, thought wives children starving home, last sticks furniture going pawnshop; children taken school, lounging dirty streets courts, listless almost play, squalid rags misery; fearful struggle employers men--lowerings wages, strikes, long course oft-repeated crime, ending every riot, fire, county yeomanry. There need dwell upon tales: Englishman whose soul sunk deep worthy name. You English boys, book meant (God bless bright faces kind hearts!), learn soon enough. Into parish state society Arthur's father thrown age twenty-five--a young married parson, full faith, hope, love. He battled like man, lots fine Utopian ideas perfectibility mankind, glorious humanity, such-like, knocked his head, real, wholesome Christian love poor, struggling, sinning men, he felt one, he spent fortune, strength, life, driven his heart. He battled like man, gotten man's reward--no silver tea-pots salvers, flowery inscriptions setting forth his virtues appreciation genteel parish; fat living stall, he never looked, did not care; sighs praises comfortable dowagers well-got-up young women, worked slippers, sugared his tea, adored “a devoted man;” manly respect, wrung unwilling souls men fancied his order natural enemies; fear hatred every one false unjust district, he master man; blessed sight women children daily becoming human homely, comfort husbands fathers. These things, course, took time, fought toil sweat brain heart, life-blood poured out. All that, Arthur laid his account give, took matter course, neither pitying himself, looking martyr, he felt wear tear making feel old his time, stifling air fever-dens telling his health. His wife seconded everything. She rather fond society, much admired run her marriage; London world she belonged pitied poor Fanny Evelyn she married young clergyman, went settle smoky hole Turley; nest Chartism Atheism, part country decent families leave years. However, somehow she did not seem care. If her husband's living amongst green fields near pleasant neighbours she would liked better--that she never pretended deny. But were. The air was not bad, all; people good sort people--civil civil them, first brush; did not expect work miracles, convert off-hand model Christians. So he she went quietly among folk, talking treating would done people rank. They did not feel anything common way, perfectly natural, none condescension consciousness manner outrages independent poor. And thus gradually respect confidence; sixteen years he looked whole neighbourhood man, man masters men could go strikes, quarrels difficulties, right true word would said without fear favour. And women come round take her advice, go her friend troubles; children worshipped ground she trod on. They three children, two daughters son, little Arthur, came his sisters. He delicate boy his childhood; thought he tendency consumption, he kept home taught his father, made companion him, he gained good scholarship, knowledge interest many subjects boys general never come across till many years older. Just he reached his thirteenth year, his father settled he strong enough go school, and, much debating himself, resolved send there, desperate typhus fever broke town. Most clergy, almost doctors, ran away; work fell tenfold weight stood work. Arthur his wife caught fever, he died days; she recovered, able nurse end, store his last words. He sensible last, calm happy, leaving his wife children fearless trust years hands Lord Friend lived died him, he, best his power, lived died. His widow's mourning deep gentle. She affected request committee freethinking club, established town factory hands (which he striven might main, nearly suppressed), number might allowed help bear coffin, anything else. Two chosen, who, six labouring men, his fellow-workmen friends, bore his grave--a man fought Lord's fight even unto death. The shops closed factories shut day parish, yet master stopped day's wages; many year afterwards townsfolk felt want brave, hopeful, loving parson his wife, lived teach mutual forbearance helpfulness, almost last given glimpse old world would people would live God instead themselves. What story? Well, dear boys, let fellow go his way, will not get anything worth having. I must show sort man begotten trained little Arthur, else will not believe him, I resolved shall do; will not see he, timid, weak boy, points bravest strongest recoiled, made his presence example felt first sides, unconsciously himself, without least attempt proselytizing. The spirit his father him, Friend his father left neglect trust. After supper night, almost nightly years afterwards, Tom Arthur, degrees East occasionally, sometimes one, sometimes another, friends, read chapter Bible together, talked afterwards. Tom first utterly astonished, almost shocked, sort way Arthur read book talked men women whose lives told. The first night happened fall chapters famine Egypt, Arthur began talking Joseph he living statesman--just he might talked Lord Grey Reform Bill, much living realities him. The book him, Tom saw, vivid delightful history real people, might right wrong, like one walking Rugby--the Doctor, masters, sixth-form boys. But astonishment soon passed off, scales seemed drop his eyes, book became ever great human divine book, men women, he looked upon something quite different himself, became his friends counsellors. For purposes, however, history one night's reading sufficient, must told here, subject, though did not happen till year afterwards, long events recorded next chapter story. Arthur, Tom, East together one night, read story Naaman coming Elisha cured his leprosy. When chapter finished, Tom shut his Bible slap. “I cannot stand fellow Naaman,” said he, “after he would seen felt, going back bowing house Rimmon, his effeminate scoundrel master it. I wonder Elisha took trouble heal him. How he must despised him!” “Yes; go usual, she will head,” struck East, always took opposite side Tom, half love argument, half conviction. “How know he did not think better it? How know his master scoundrel? His letter do not look like it, book do not say so.” “I do not care,” rejoined Tom; “why Naaman talk bowing down, then, he did not mean it? He was not likely get earnest he got back court, away prophet.” “Well, but, Tom,” said Arthur, “look Elisha says him--'Go peace.' He would not said Naaman wrong.” “I do not see means saying, 'You are man I took for.'” “No, no; will not all,” said East. “Read words fairly, take men find them. I like Naaman, think he fine fellow.” “I do not,” said Tom positively. “Well, I think East right,” said Arthur; “I cannot see it is right best can, though may not best absolutely. Every man is not born martyr.” “Of course, course,” said East; “but he is one his pet hobbies.--How often I told you, Tom, must drive nail it will go.” “And often I told you,” rejoined Tom, “that it will always go want, stick hit hard enough. I hate half-measures compromises.” “Yes, he is whole-hog man, Tom. Must whole animal-hair teeth, claws tail,” laughed East. “Sooner bread day half loaf.” “I do not know;” said Arthur--“it is rather puzzling; are not right things got proper compromises--I mean principle is not given up?” “That is point,” said Tom; “I do not object compromise, do not give principle.” “Not you,” said East laughingly.--“I know old, Arthur, you will find day. There is not reasonable fellow world, hear talk. He never wants anything what is right fair; come settle what is right fair, it is everything he wants, nothing want. And that is his idea compromise. Give Brown compromise I am his side.” “Now, Harry,” said Tom, “no chaff. I am serious. Look here. This makes blood tingle.” And he turned pages his Bible read, “Shadrach, Meshach, Abed-nego answered said king, O Nebuchadnezzar, careful answer thee matter. If so, God serve able deliver us burning fiery furnace, he deliver us thine hand, O king. But not, known unto thee, O king, serve thy gods, worship golden image thou hast set up.” He read last verse twice, emphasizing nots, dwelling gave actual pleasure, hard part with. They silent minute, Arthur said, “Yes, that is glorious story, do not prove point, Tom, I think. There times one way, highest, men found stand breach.” “There is always highest way, it is always right one,” said Tom. “How many times Doctor told us his sermons last year, I like know?” “Well, are not going convince us--is he, Arthur? No Brown compromise to-night,” said East, looking his watch. “But it is past eight, must go first lesson. What bore!” So took books fell work; Arthur did not forget, thought long often conversation. CHAPTER III--ARTHUR MAKES A FRIEND. “Let Nature teacher: Sweet lore Nature brings. Our meddling intellect Misshapes beauteous forms things. We murder dissect. Enough Science Art: Close barren leaves; Come forth, bring heart That watches receives.”--WORDSWORTH. About six weeks beginning half, Tom Arthur sitting one night supper beginning verses, Arthur suddenly stopped, looked up, said, “Tom, know anything Martin?” “Yes,” said Tom, taking his hand his back hair, delighted throw his Gradus ad Parnassum sofa; “I know pretty well. He is good fellow, mad hatter. He is called Madman, know. And never fellow getting sorts rum things him. He tamed two snakes last half, used carry his pocket; I will bound he is got hedgehogs rats his cupboard now, one knows besides.” “I like much know him,” said Arthur; “he next form to-day, he would lost his book looked mine, he seemed kind gentle I liked much.” “Ah, poor old Madman, he is always losing his books,” said Tom, “and getting called floored he has not got them.” “I like better,” said Arthur. “Well, he is great fun, I tell you,” said Tom, throwing back sofa, chuckling remembrance. “We game one day last half. He kicking horrid stinks time his study, till I suppose fellow told Mary, she told Doctor. Anyhow, one day little dinner, he came library, Doctor, instead going home, came striding hall. East I five six fellows fire, preciously stared, he do not come like year, unless wet day there is fight hall. 'East,' says he, 'just come show Martin's study.' 'Oh, here is game,' whispered rest us; cut upstairs Doctor, East leading. As got New Row, hardly wide enough hold Doctor his gown, click, click, click, heard old Madman's den. Then stopped sudden, bolts went like fun. The Madman knew East's step, thought going siege. “'It is Doctor, Martin. He is wants see you,' sings East. “Then bolts went back slowly, door opened, old Madman standing, looking precious scared--his jacket off, his shirt-sleeves his elbows, his long skinny arms covered anchors arrows letters, tattooed gunpowder like sailor-boy's, stink fit knock coming out. It Was Doctor could stand his ground, East I, looking his arms, held noses tight. The old magpie standing window-sill, his feathers drooping, looking disgusted half-poisoned. “'What about, Martin?' says Doctor. 'You really must not go way; you are nuisance whole passage.' “'Please, sir, I mixing powder; is not harm it. And Madman seized nervously his pestle mortar, show Doctor harmlessness his pursuits, went pounding--click, click, click. He had not given six clicks before, puff! went whole great blaze, away went pestle mortar across study, back tumbled passage. The magpie fluttered court, swearing, Madman danced out, howling, his fingers his mouth. The Doctor caught hold him, called us fetch water. 'There, silly fellow,' said he, quite pleased, though, find he was not much hurt, 'you see do not know least you are things; now, mind, must give practising chemistry yourself.' Then he took hold his arm looked it, I saw he bite his lip, his eyes twinkled; he said, quite grave, 'Here, see, you have making foolish marks yourself, never get out, you will sorry year two. Now come housekeeper's room, let us see hurt.' And away went two, stayed regular turn-out den, till Martin came back his hand bandaged turned us out. However, I will go see he is after, tell come prayers supper.” And away went Tom find boy question, dwelt little study himself, New Row. The aforesaid Martin, Arthur taken fancy for, one unfortunates time day (and are, I fear, still) quite places public school. If knew use boys, Martin would seized upon educated natural philosopher. He passion birds, beasts, insects, knew habits one Rugby--except perhaps Doctor, knew everything. He also experimental chemist small scale, made unto electric machine, his greatest pleasure glory administer small shocks small boys rash enough venture his study. And means adventure free excitement; besides probability snake dropping head twining lovingly leg, rat getting breeches-pocket search food, animal chemical odour faced, always hung den, chance blown many experiments Martin always trying, wondrous results shape explosions smells mortal boy ever heard of. Of course, poor Martin, consequence his pursuits, become Ishmaelite house. In first place, he half-poisoned his neighbours, turn always lookout pounce upon his numerous live-stock, drive frantic enticing his pet old magpie his window neighbouring study, making disreputable old bird drunk toast soaked beer sugar. Then Martin, his sins, inhabited study looking small court ten feet across, window completely commanded studies opposite Sick-room Row, latter slightly higher elevation. East, another boy equally tormenting ingenious turn mind, lived exactly opposite, expended huge pains time preparation instruments annoyance behoof Martin his live colony. One morning old basket made appearance, suspended short cord outside Martin's window, deposited amateur nest containing four young hungry jackdaws, pride glory Martin's life, time being, he currently asserted hatched upon his person. Early morning late night he seen half window, administering varied wants his callow brood. After deep cogitation, East his chum spliced knife end fishing-rod; watched Martin out, had, half hour's severe sawing, cut string basket suspended, tumbled pavement below, hideous remonstrance occupants. Poor Martin, returning his short absence, collected fragments replaced his brood (except one whose neck broken descent) old location, suspending time string wire twisted together, defiant sharp instrument his persecutors could command. But, like Russian engineers Sebastopol, East his chum answer every move adversary, next day mounted gun shape pea-shooter upon ledge window, trained bear exactly upon spot Martin occupy tending his nurslings. The moment he began feed began shoot. In vain enemy invest pea-shooter, endeavour answer fire he fed young birds his hand; his attention divided, his shots flew wild, every one told his face hands, drove howlings imprecations. He driven ensconce nest corner his already too-well-filled den. His door barricaded set ingenious bolts his invention, sieges frequent neighbours unusually ambrosial odour spread den neighbouring studies. The door panels normal state smash, frame door resisted besiegers, behind owner carried his varied pursuits--much state mind, I fancy, border-farmer lived in, days moss-troopers, his hold might summoned his cattle carried minute night day. “Open, Martin, old boy; it is I, Tom Brown.” “Oh, well; stop moment.” One bolt went back. “You are sure East is not there?” “No, no; hang it, open.” Tom gave kick, bolt creaked, he entered den. Den indeed was--about five feet six inches long five wide, seven feet high. About six tattered school-books, chemical books, Taxidermy, Stanley Birds, odd volume Bewick, latter much better preservation, occupied top shelves. The shelves, cut away used owner purposes, fitted abiding-places birds, beasts, reptiles. There attempt carpet curtain. The table entirely occupied great work Martin, electric machine, covered carefully remains his table-cloth. The jackdaw cage occupied one wall; adorned small hatchet, pair climbing irons, his tin candle-box, he time endeavouring raise hopeful young family field-mice. As nothing let lie useless, well candle-box thus occupied, candles Martin never had. A pound issued weekly, boys; candles available capital, easily exchangeable birds' eggs young birds, Martin's pound invariably found way hours Howlett's bird-fancier's, Bilton road, would give hawk's nightingale's egg young linnet exchange. Martin's ingenuity therefore ever rack supply light. Just he hit upon grand invention, den lighted flaring cotton wick issuing ginger-beer bottle full doleful composition. When light altogether failed him, Martin would loaf fires passages hall, manner Diggs, try his verses learn his lines firelight. “Well, old boy, have not got sweeter den half. How stuff bottle stinks! Never mind; I are not going stop; come prayers study. You know young Arthur. We have got Gray's study. We will good supper talk bird-nesting.” Martin evidently highly pleased invitation, promised without fail. As soon prayers over, sixth fifth form boys withdrawn aristocratic seclusion room, rest, democracy, sat supper hall, Tom Arthur, secured allowances bread cheese, started feet catch eye praepostor week, remained charge supper, walking hall. He happened easy-going fellow, got pleasant nod “Please may I go out?” away scrambled prepare Martin sumptuous banquet. This Tom insisted on, he great delight occasion, reason delight must expounded. The fact first attempt friendship his Arthur made, Tom hailed grand step. The ease he became hail-fellow-well-met anybody, blundered twenty friendships half-year, made sometimes sorry sometimes angry Arthur's reserve loneliness. True, Arthur always pleasant, even jolly, boys came Tom study; Tom felt him, were, his chum associated others, Arthur would dwelling wilderness. This increased his consciousness responsibility; though he had not reasoned made clear yet somehow he knew responsibility, trust he taken without thinking it, head heels fact, centre turning-point his school-life, make mar him, his appointed work trial time being. And Tom becoming new boy, though frequent tumbles dirt perpetual hard battle himself, daily growing manfulness thoughtfulness, every high-couraged well-principled boy must, he finds first time consciously grips self devil. Already he could turn almost without sigh School-gates, scampered East three four others his particular set, bound jolly lark quite according law, involving probably row louts, keepers, farm-labourers, skipping dinner calling-over, Phoebe Jennings's beer, possible flogging end relish. He quite got stage he would grumble himself--“Well, hang it, it is hard Doctor saddled Arthur. Why could not he chummed Fogey, Thomkin, fellows never anything walk round close, finish copies first day they are set?” But although past, he longed, felt he right longing, time legitimate pastimes cricket, fives, bathing, fishing, within bounds, Arthur could yet his companion; he felt “young un” (as he generally called him) found pursuit friend himself, he able give time education his body clear conscience. And he wished come pass; he almost hailed special providence (as indeed was, reasons he gave it--what providences are?) Arthur singled Martin fellows friend. “The old Madman fellow,” thought he; “he take scrambling half country birds' eggs flowers, make run swim climb like Indian, teach word anything bad, keep his lessons. What luck!” And so, his usual heartiness, he dived his cupboard, hauled old knuckle-bone ham, two three bottles beer, together solemn pewter used state occasions; Arthur, equally elated easy accomplishment his first act volition joint establishment, produced his side bottle pickles pot jam, cleared table. In minute two noise boys coming supper heard, Martin knocked admitted, bearing his bread cheese; three fell hearty good-will upon viands, talking faster ate, shyness disappeared moment Tom's bottled-beer hospitable ways. “Here is Arthur, regular young town-mouse, natural taste woods, Martin, longing break his neck climbing trees, passion young snakes.” “Well, I say,” sputtered Martin eagerly, “will come to-morrow, you, Caldecott's Spinney then? I know kestrel's nest, fir-tree. I cannot get without help; and, Brown, climb one.” “Oh yes, let us go,” said Arthur; “I never saw hawk's nest hawk's egg.” “You come study, then, I will show five sorts,” said Martin. “Ay, old Madman got best collection house, out,” said Tom; Martin, warming unaccustomed good cheer chance convert, launched proposed bird-nesting campaign, betraying manner important secrets--a golden-crested wren's nest near Butlin's Mound, moor-hen sitting nine eggs pond Barby road, kingfisher's nest corner old canal Brownsover Mill. He heard, he said, one ever got kingfisher's nest perfect, British Museum, Government, somebody, offered 100 pounds one could bring nest eggs damaged. In middle astounding announcement, others listening open ears, already considering application 100 pounds, knock came door, East's voice heard craving admittance. “There is Harry,” said Tom; “we will let in. I will keep steady, Martin. I thought old boy would smell supper.” The fact was, Tom's heart already smitten asking his fidus Achates feast, although extempore affair; though prudence desire get Martin Arthur together alone first overcome his scruples, he heartily glad open door, broach another bottle beer, hand old ham-knuckle searching his old friend's pocket-knife. “Ah, greedy vagabonds,” said East, his mouth full, “I knew something going I saw cut hall quick suppers. What stunning tap, Tom! You wunner bottling swipes.” “I have practice enough sixth time, it is hard I have not picked wrinkle two benefit.” “Well, old Madman, goes bird-nesting campaign? How is Howlett? I expect young rooks'll another fortnight, turn comes.” “There will young rooks fit pies month yet; shows much know it,” rejoined Martin, who, though good friends East, regarded considerable suspicion his propensity practical jokes. “Scud knows nothing cares nothing grub mischief,” said Tom; “but young rook pie, specially you have climb them, pretty eating.--However, I say, Scud, we are going hawk's nest to-morrow, Caldecott's Spinney; you will come behave yourself, we will stunning climb.” “And bathe Aganippe. Hooray! I am man.” “No, no; bathing Aganippe; that is betters go.” “Well, well, never mind. I am hawk's nest, anything turns up.” And bottled-beer finished, his hunger appeased, East departed his study, “that sneak Jones,” he informed them, got sixth, occupied next study, instituted nightly visitation upon East his chum, small discomfort. When he gone Martin rose follow, Tom stopped him. “No one goes near New Row,” said he, “so may well stop verses, we will talk. We will end quiet. Besides, praepostor comes now. We have not visited half.” So table cleared, cloth restored, three fell work Gradus dictionary upon morning's vulgus. They three fair examples way tasks done Rugby, consulship Plancus. And doubtless method little changed, nothing new sun, especially schools. Now known unto boys schools rejoice time-honoured institution vulgus (commonly supposed established William Wykeham Winchester, imported Rugby Arnold sake lines learnt heart intrinsic value, I have always understood), short exercise Greek Latin verse, given subject, minimum number lines fixed form. The master form gave fourth lesson previous day subject next morning's vulgus, first lesson boy bring his vulgus ready looked over; vulgus, certain number lines one Latin Greek poets construed form got heart. The master first lesson called boy form order, put lines. If he could not say them, seem say them, reading master's boy's book stood near, he sent back, went boys say seem say them; either case his vulgus looked master, gave entered his book, credit discredit boy, many marks composition merited. At Rugby vulgus lines first lesson every day week, Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays; thirty-eight weeks school year, obvious meanest capacity master form set one hundred fourteen subjects every year, two hundred twenty-eight every two years, on. Now, persons moderate invention considerable task, human nature prone repeat itself, wondered masters gave subjects sometimes certain lapse time. To meet rebuke bad habit masters, schoolboy mind, accustomed ingenuity, invented elaborate system tradition. Almost every boy kept his vulgus written book, books duly handed boy boy, till (if tradition gone till now) I suppose popular boys, whose hands bequeathed vulgus-books accumulated, prepared three four vulguses subject heaven earth, “more worlds one,” unfortunate master pitch upon. At rate, lucky fellows generally one one friend time. The objection traditionary method vulguses risk successions might become confused, another follower traditions show identical vulgus fine morning; case, happened, considerable grief result. But risk hinder boys men short cuts pleasant paths? Now study night Tom upholder traditionary method vulgus doing. He carefully produced two large vulgus-books, began diving them, picking line here, ending (tags, vulgarly called), till he gotten he thought he could make fit. He proceeded patch his tags together help his Gradus, producing incongruous feeble result eight elegiac lines, minimum quantity his form, finishing two highly moral lines extra, making ten all, he cribbed entire one his books, beginning “O genus humanum,” he must used dozen times before, whenever unfortunate wicked hero, whatever nation language sun, subject. Indeed he began great doubts whether master would not remember them, throw extra lines, case would call attention tags, detected, extra lines, he would not sent back place, passed muster he would get marks them. The second method, pursued Martin, may called dogged prosaic method. He, Tom, took pleasure task, old vulgus-books his own, one's else, could follow traditionary method, too, Tom remarked, he had not genius. Martin proceeded write eight lines English, matter-of-fact kind, first came his head; convert these, line line, main force Gradus dictionary Latin would scan. This he cared for--to produce eight lines false quantities concords: whether words apt, sense was, mattered nothing; article new, line beyond minimum followers dogged method ever produce. The third, artistic method, Arthur's. He considered first point character event subject could neatly brought within limits vulgus, trying always get his idea eight lines, binding ten even twelve lines he could not this. He set work much possible without Gradus help, clothe his idea appropriate Latin Greek, would satisfied till he polished well aptest poetic words phrases he could get at. A fourth method, indeed, used school, simple kind require comment. It may called vicarious method, obtained amongst big boys lazy bullying habits, consisted simply making clever boys could thrash whole vulgus them, construe afterwards; latter method encouraged, I strongly advise practise. Of others, find traditionary troublesome, unless steal vulguses whole (experto crede), artistic method pays best marks ways. The vulguses finished nine of the clock, Martin rejoiced measure abundance light, Gradus dictionary, conveniences almost unknown getting work, pressed Arthur come his verses whenever he liked, three boys went Martin's den, Arthur initiated lore birds' eggs, his great delight. The exquisite colouring forms astonished charmed him, scarcely ever seen hen's egg ostrich's, time he lugged away bed he learned names least twenty sorts, dreamed glorious perils tree-climbing, he found roc's egg island big Sinbad's, clouded like tit-lark's, blowing Martin he nearly drowned yolk. CHAPTER IV--THE BIRD-FANCIERS. “I found gift fair-- I found wood-pigeons breed; But let plunder forbear, She would say it was barbarous deed.”--ROWE. “And now, lad, take five shilling, And advice future think; So Billy pouched willing, And got night disguised drink.”--MS. Ballad. The next morning, first lesson, Tom turned back his lines, wait till second round; Martin Arthur said right, got school once. When Tom got ran breakfast Harrowell's missing, Stumps informed swallowed breakfasts gone together--where, he could not say. Tom hurried his breakfast, went first Martin's study his own; signs missing boys found. He felt half angry jealous Martin. Where could gone? He learnt second lesson East rest good temper, went quadrangle. About ten minutes school Martin Arthur arrived quadrangle breathless; catching sight him, Arthur rushed up, excitement, bright glow his face. “O Tom, look here!” cried he, holding three moor-hen's eggs; “we have Barby road, pool Martin told us last night, see we have got.” Tom would not pleased, looked something find fault with. “Why, young un,” said he, “what after? You do not mean say you have wading?” The tone reproach made poor little Arthur shrink moment look piteous; Tom shrug his shoulders turned his anger Martin. “Well, I did not think, Madman, you would muff let getting wet time day. You might done wading yourself.” “So I did, course; he would come too, see nest. We left six eggs in. They will hatched day two.” “Hang eggs!” said Tom; “a fellow cannot turn his back moment his work's undone. He will laid week precious lark, I will bound.” “Indeed, Tom, now,” pleaded Arthur, “my feet are not wet, Martin made take shoes stockings trousers.” “But wet, dirty too; cannot I see?” answered Tom; “and you will called floored master sees state you are in. You have not looked second lesson, know.” O Tom, old humbug! upbraiding one learning lessons! If had not floored first lesson, mean say would not them? And you have taken away poor little Arthur's joy pride his first birds' eggs, he goes puts study, takes his books sigh, thinking he done something horribly wrong, whereas he learnt advance much done second lesson. But old Madman has not, gets called up, makes frightful shots, losing ten places, getting floored. This somewhat appeases Tom's wrath, end lesson he regained his temper. And afterwards study he begins get right again, he watches Arthur's intense joy seeing Martin blowing eggs gluing carefully bits cardboard, notes anxious, loving looks little fellow casts sidelong him. And he thinks, “What ill-tempered beast I am! Here is I wishing last night come about, I am spoiling all,” another five minutes swallowed last mouthful his bile, repaid seeing his little sensitive plant expand sun his smiles. After dinner Madman busy preparations expedition, fitting new straps his climbing-irons, filling large pill-boxes cotton-wool, sharpening East's small axe. They carry munitions calling-overs directly afterwards, dodged praepostors lookout fags cricket, four set smart trot Lawford footpath, straight Caldecott's Spinney hawk's nest. Martin leads way high feather; quite new sensation him, getting companions, he finds pleasant, means show manner proofs his science skill. Brown East may better cricket football games, thinks he, fields woods see I cannot teach something. He taken leadership already, strides away front his climbing-irons strapped one arm, his pecking-bag other, his pockets hat full pill-boxes, cotton-wool, etceteras. Each others carries pecking-bag, East his hatchet. When crossed three four fields without check, Arthur began lag; Tom seeing shouted Martin pull bit. “We are not hare-and-hounds. What is good grinding rate?” “There is Spinney,” said Martin, pulling brow slope bottom lay Lawford brook, pointing top opposite slope; “the nest one high fir-trees end. And brook I know sedge-bird's nest. We will go look coming back.” “Oh, come on, do not let us stop,” said Arthur, getting excited sight wood. So broke trot again, soon across brook, slope, Spinney. Here advanced noiselessly possible, lest keepers enemies about, stopped foot tall fir, top Martin pointed pride kestrel's nest, object quest. “Oh, where? it?” asks Arthur, gaping air, vague idea would like. “There, do not see?” said East, pointing lump mistletoe next tree, beech. He saw Martin Tom busy climbing-irons, could not resist temptation hoaxing. Arthur stared wondered ever. “Well, curious! It does not look bit like I expected,” said he. “Very odd birds, kestrels,” said East, looking waggishly his victim, still star-gazing. “But I thought fir-tree?” objected Arthur. “Ah, do not know? That is new sort fir old Caldecott brought Himalayas.” “Really!” said Arthur; “I am glad I know that. How unlike firs are! They well here, do not they? The Spinney's full them.” “What is humbug he is telling you?” cried Tom, looking up, caught word Himalayas, suspecting East after. “Only fir,” said Arthur, putting his hand stem beech. “Fir!” shouted Tom; “why, do not mean say, young un, do not know beech see one?” Poor little Arthur looked terribly ashamed, East exploded laughter made wood ring. “I have hardly ever seen trees,” faltered Arthur. “What shame hoax him, Scud!” cried Martin.--“Never mind, Arthur; shall know trees he week two.” “And is not kestrel's nest, then?” asked Arthur. “That! Why, that is piece mistletoe. There is nest, lump sticks fir.” “Do not believe him, Arthur,” struck incorrigible East; “I saw old magpie go it.” Martin deign reply sally, except grunt, he buckled last buckle his climbing-irons, Arthur looked reproachfully East without speaking. But came tug war. It difficult tree climb branches reached, first fourteen feet up, trunk large bottom swarmed; fact, neither boys could reach half round arms. Martin Tom, irons on, tried without success first; fir bark broke away stuck irons soon leant weight feet, grip arms was not enough keep up; so, getting three four feet, came slithering ground, barking arms faces. They furious, East sat laughing shouting failure, “Two one old magpie!” “We must try pyramid,” said Tom last. “Now, Scud, lazy rascal, stick tree!” “I dare say! standing shoulders irons on. What think skin's made of?” However, he got, leant tree, putting his head clasping his arms far he could. “Now then, Madman,” said Tom, “you next.” “No, I am lighter you; go next.” So Tom got East's shoulders, grasped tree above, Martin scrambled Tom's shoulders, amidst totterings groanings pyramid, and, spring sent his supporters howling ground, clasped stem ten feet up, remained clinging. For moment two thought he could not get up; then, holding arms teeth, he worked first one iron firmly bark, got another grip his arms, another minute hold lowest branch. “All old magpie now,” said East; minute's rest, went Martin, hand hand, watched Arthur fearful eagerness. “Is not dangerous?” said he. “Not bit,” answered Tom; “you cannot hurt get good hand-hold. Try every branch good pull trust it, go.” Martin amongst small branches close nest, away dashed old bird, soared trees, watching intruder. “All right--four eggs!” shouted he. “Take  them all!” shouted East; “that will one a-piece.” “No, no; leave one, she will not care,” said Tom. We boys idea birds could not count, quite content long left one egg. I hope so. Martin carefully put one egg his boxes third his mouth, place safety, came like lamplighter. All went well till he within ten feet ground, when, trunk enlarged, his hold got less less firm, last he came run, tumbling his back turf, spluttering spitting remains great egg, broken jar his fall. “Ugh, ugh! something drink--ugh! addled,” spluttered he, wood rang merry laughter East Tom. Then examined prizes, gathered things, went brook, Martin swallowed huge draughts water get rid taste; visited sedge-bird's nest, thence struck across country high glee, beating hedges brakes went along; Arthur last, his intense delight, allowed climb small hedgerow oak magpie's nest Tom, kept round like mother, showed hold throw his weight; though he great fright, did not show it, applauded his lissomness. They crossed road soon afterwards, there, close them, lay great heap charming pebbles. “Look here,” shouted East; “here is luck! I have longing good, honest pecking half-hour. Let us fill bags, foozling bird-nesting.” No one objected, boy filled fustian bag he carried full stones. They crossed next field, Tom East taking one side hedges, two side. Noise enough made certainly, early season young birds, old birds strong wing young marksmen, flew shot first discharge. But great fun, rushing along hedgerows, discharging stone stone blackbirds chaffinches, though result shape slaughtered birds obtained; Arthur soon entered it, rushed head back birds, shouted, threw, tumbled ditches, hedges, wild Madman himself. Presently party, full cry old blackbird (who evidently used thing enjoyed fun, he would wait till came close him, fly forty yards so, and, impudent flicker his tail, dart depths quickset), came beating high double hedge, two side. “There he again,” “Head him,” “Let drive,” “I there,” “Take care you are throwing, Madman.” The shouts might heard quarter mile off. They heard two hundred yards farmer two his shepherds, doctoring sheep fold next field. Now, farmer question rented house yard situate end field young bird-fanciers arrived, house yard he did not occupy keep one else in. Nevertheless, like brainless unreasoning Briton, he persisted maintaining premises large stock cocks, hens, poultry. Of course, sorts depredators visited place time time: foxes gipsies wrought havoc night; daytime, I regret confess visits Rugby boys, consequent disappearances ancient respectable fowls unfrequent. Tom East period outlawry visited farm question felonious purposes, one occasion conquered slain duck there, borne away carcass triumphantly, hidden handkerchiefs. However, sickened practice trouble anxiety wretched duck's body caused them. They carried Sally Harrowell's, hopes good supper; she, examining it, made long face, refused dress anything it. Then took study, began plucking themselves; feathers, hide them? “Good gracious, Tom, lot feathers duck has!” groaned East, holding bagful his hand, looking disconsolately carcass, yet half plucked. “And I think he is getting high, too, already,” said Tom, smelling cautiously, “so must finish soon.” “Yes, well; cook him? I am sure I are not going try hall passages; cannot afford roasting ducks about--our character's bad.” “I wish rid brute,” said Tom, throwing table disgust. And day two became clear got rid he must be; packed sealed brown paper, put cupboard unoccupied study, he found holidays matron, gruesome body. They never duck-hunting since, others had, bold yeoman sore subject, bent making example first boys he could catch. So he his shepherds crouched behind hurdles, watched party, approaching unconscious. Why old guinea-fowl lying hedge particular moment year? Who say? Guinea-fowls always are; things, animals, persons, requisite getting one scrapes--always ready mischief come them. At rate, East's nose popped old guinea-hen, scuttling along shrieking, “Come back, come back,” top her voice. Either three might perhaps withstood temptation, East first let us drive stone he his hand her, rushes turn her hedge again. He succeeds, dear life, hedge full cry, “Come back, come back,” getting shriller fainter every minute. Meantime, farmer his men steal hurdles creep hedge towards scene action. They almost within stone's throw Martin, pressing unlucky chase hard, Tom catches sight them, sings out, “Louts, 'ware louts, side! Madman, look ahead!” catching hold Arthur, hurries away across field towards Rugby hard tear. Had he himself, he would stayed see others, his heart sinks his pluck goes. The idea led Doctor Arthur bagging fowls quite unmans takes half run him. However, boys able take care East Martin; dodge pursuers, slip gap, come pelting Tom Arthur, catch time. The farmer his men making good running field behind. Tom wishes made direction, together, must see out. “You will not leave young un, you?” says he, haul poor little Arthur, already losing wind fright, next hedge. “Not we,” answer both. The next hedge stiff one; pursuers gain horribly them, pull Arthur through, two great rents his trousers, foremost shepherd comes side. As start next field, aware two figures walking footpath middle it, recognize Holmes Diggs taking constitutional. Those good-natured fellows immediately shout, “On.” “Let us go surrender,” pants Tom. Agreed. And another minute four boys, great astonishment worthies, rush breathless Holmes Diggs, pull see matter; whole explained appearance farmer his men, unite forces bear knot boys. There time explain, Tom's heart beats frightfully quick, he ponders, “Will stand us?” The farmer makes rush East collars him; young gentleman, unusual discretion, instead kicking his shins, looks appealingly Holmes, stands still. “Hullo there; fast,” says Holmes, bound stand till proved wrong. “Now what is about?” “I have got young varmint last, I,” pants farmer; “why, they have a-skulking yard stealing fowls--that is it is; I doan't flogged it, every one  them, name are not Thompson.” Holmes looks grave Diggs's face falls. They quite ready fight--no boys school so; praepostors, understand office, cannot uphold unrighteous causes. “I have not near his old barn half,” cries East. “Nor I,” “Nor I,” chime Tom Martin. “Now, Willum, did not see  them last week?” “Ees, I seen  them sure enough,” says Willum, grasping prong he carried, preparing action. The boys deny stoutly, Willum driven admit “if worn't it was chaps like  them two peas'n;” “leastways he will swear he see'd two yard last Martinmas,” indicating East Tom. Holmes time meditate. “Now, sir,” says he Willum, “you see cannot remember seen, I believe boys.” “I doan't care,” blusters farmer; “they arter fowls to-day--that is enough I.--Willum, catch hold t'other chap. They have a-sneaking two hours, I tells 'ee,” shouted he, Holmes stands Martin Willum, “and druv matter dozen young pullets pretty nigh death.” “Oh, there is whacker!” cried East; “we have not within hundred yards his barn; have not ten minutes, we have seen nothing tough old guinea-hen, ran like greyhound.” “Indeed, that is true, Holmes, upon honour,” added Tom; “we were not his fowls; guinea-hen ran hedge feet, we have seen nothing else.” “Drat talk. Thee catch hold t'other, Willum, come along wi' un.” “Farmer Thompson,” said Holmes, warning Willum prong his stick, Diggs faced shepherd, cracking his fingers like pistol-shots, “now listen reason. The boys have not fowls, that is plain.” “Tells 'ee I see'd'them. Who you, I like know?” “Never mind, farmer,” answered Holmes. “And I will tell is: ought ashamed leaving poultry about, one watch it, near School. You deserve stolen. So choose come Doctor them, I shall go you, tell I think it.” The farmer began take Holmes master; besides, he wanted get back his flock. Corporal punishment question, odds great; he began hint paying damage. Arthur jumped this, offering pay anything, farmer immediately valued guinea-hen half sovereign. “Half sovereign!” cried East, released farmer's grip; “well, good one! The old hen are not hurt bit, she is seven years old, I know, tough whipcord; she could not lay another egg save her life.” It last settled pay farmer two shillings, his man one shilling; matter ended, unspeakable relief Tom, had not able say word, sick heart idea Doctor would think him; whole party boys marched footpath towards Rugby. Holmes, one best boys School, began improve occasion. “Now, youngsters,” said he, he marched along middle them, “mind this; you are well scrape. Do not go near Thompson's barn again; hear?” Profuse promises all, especially East. “Mind, I do not ask questions,” went Mentor, “but I rather think his chickens. Now, knocking people's chickens, running them, stealing. It is nasty word, that is plain English it. If chickens dead lying shop, would not take them, I know that, would apples Griffith's basket; there is real difference chickens running apples tree, articles shop. I wish morals sounder matters. There is nothing mischievous school distinctions, jumble right wrong, justify things us poor boys would sent prison.” And good old Holmes delivered his soul walk home many wise sayings, and, song says, “Gee'd  them sight good advice;” sermon sank all, less, penitent several hours. But truth compels admit East, rate, forgot week, remembered insult put upon Farmer Thompson, Tadpole hair-brained youngsters committed raid barn soon afterwards, caught shepherds severely handled, besides pay eight shillings--all money world--to escape taken Doctor. Martin became constant inmate joint study time, Arthur took kindly Tom could not resist slight fits jealousy, which, however, he managed keep himself. The kestrel's eggs broken, strange say, formed nucleus Arthur's collection, Martin worked heart soul, introduced Arthur Howlett bird-fancier, instructed rudiments art stuffing. In token his gratitude, Arthur allowed Martin tattoo small anchor one his wrists; decoration, however, he carefully concealed Tom. Before end half-year he trained bold climber good runner, and, Martin foretold, knew twice much trees, birds, flowers, many things, good-hearted facetious young friend Harry East. CHAPTER V--THE FIGHT: “Surgebat Macnevisius Et mox jactabat ultro, Pugnabo tua gratia Feroci hoc Mactwoltro.”--Etonian. There certain sort fellow--we used studying boys know well enough--of predicate almost positive certainty, he month school, he sure fight, almost equal certainty he one. Tom Brown one these; well-weighed intention give full, true, correct account Tom's single combat school-fellow manner old friend Bell's Life, let young persons whose stomachs strong, think good set-to weapons God given us uncivilized, unchristian, ungentlemanly affair, skip chapter once, will not taste. It usual days two School-house boys fight. Of course exceptions, cross-grained, hard-headed fellow came would never happy unless he quarrelling his nearest neighbours, class-dispute, fifth form fags, instance, required blood-letting; champion picked side tacitly, settled matter good hearty mill. But, part, constant use surest keepers peace, boxing-gloves, kept School-house boys fighting one another. Two three nights every week gloves brought out, either hall fifth-form room; every boy ever likely fight knew his neighbours' prowess perfectly well, could tell nicety chance he would stand-up fight boy house. But, course, experience could gotten regarded boys houses; houses less jealous School-house, collisions frequent. After all, would life without fighting, I like know? From cradle grave, fighting, rightly understood, business, real highest, honestest business every son man. Every one worth his salt his enemies, must beaten, evil thoughts habits himself, spiritual wickednesses high places, Russians, Border-ruffians, Bill, Tom, Harry, let live his life quiet till he thrashed them. It good quakers, body men, uplift voices fighting. Human nature strong them, do not follow precepts. Every soul his piece fighting, somehow somewhere. The world might better world without fighting, anything I know, would not world; therefore I dead crying peace peace, is not meant be. I sorry man see folk fighting wrong people wrong things, I would deal sooner see fight them. So recorded, record, hero's fights sorts, sorts enemies, I shall proceed give account his passage-at-arms one his school-fellows he ever encounter manner. It drawing towards close Arthur's first half-year, May evenings lengthening out. Locking-up till eight of the clock, everybody beginning talk he would holidays. The she will, form dramatis personae are, reading, amongst things, last book Homer's “Iliad,” worked far speeches women Hector's body. It whole school-day, four five School-house boys (amongst Arthur, Tom, East) preparing third lesson together. They finished regulation forty lines, part getting tired, notwithstanding exquisite pathos Helen's lamentation. And several long four-syllabled words come together, boy dictionary strikes work. “I going look words,” says he; “we have done quantity. Ten one shall not get far. Let us go close.” “Come along, boys,” cries East, always ready leave “the grind,” he called it; “our old coach laid up, know, shall one new masters, who is sure go slow let us easy.” So adjournment close carried nem. con., little Arthur daring uplift his voice; but, deeply interested reading, stayed quietly behind, learnt his pleasure. As East said, regular master form unwell, heard one new masters--quite young man, left university. Certainly would hard lines if, dawdling much possible coming taking places, entering long-winded explanations usual course regular master form, others stock contrivances boys wasting time school, could spin lesson he work forty lines. As quantity perpetual fight going master his form--the latter insisting, enforcing passive resistance, prescribed quantity Homer she will lesson; former, fixed quantity, must always ready go fifty sixty lines time within hour. However, notwithstanding efforts, new master got horribly quick. He seemed bad taste really interested lesson, trying work something like appreciation it, giving good, spirited English words, instead wretched bald stuff rendered poor old Homer, construing piece them, boy, show done. Now clock strikes three-quarters; quarter hour more, forty lines done. So boys, one another, called up, stick more, make balder ever bald work it. The poor young master pretty near beat time, feels ready knock his head wall, his fingers somebody else's head. So he gives altogether lower middle parts form, looks round despair boys top bench, see one he strike spark two, chivalrous murder beautiful utterances beautiful woman old world. His eye rests Arthur, he calls finish construing Helen's speech. Whereupon boys draw long breaths, begin stare take easy. They safe: Arthur head form, sure able construe, tide safely till hour strikes. Arthur proceeds read passage Greek construing it, custom is. Tom, is not paying much attention, suddenly caught falter his voice he reads two lines-- [greek text deleted] He looks Arthur. “Why, bless us,” thinks he, “what matter young un? He is never going get floored. He is sure learnt end.” Next moment he reassured spirited tone Arthur begins construing, betakes drawing dogs' heads his notebook, master, evidently enjoying change, turns his back middle bench stands Arthur, beating sort time his hand foot, saying; “Yes, yes,” “Very well,” Arthur goes on. But he nears fatal two lines, Tom catches falter, looks up. He sees something matter; Arthur hardly get all. What be? Suddenly point Arthur breaks altogether, fairly bursts crying, dashes cuff his jacket across his eyes, blushing roots his hair, feeling he like go suddenly floor. The whole form taken aback; stare stupidly him, gifted presence mind find places look steadily books, hopes catching master's eye getting called Arthur's place. The master looks puzzled moment, seeing, fact is, boy really affected tears touching thing Homer, perhaps profane poetry put together, steps lays his hand kindly his shoulder, saying, “Never mind, little man, you have construed well. Stop minute; there is hurry.” Now, luck would it, sat next Tom day, middle bench form, big boy, name Williams, generally supposed cock she will, therefore school fifths. The small boys, great speculators prowess elders, used hold forth one another Williams's great strength, discuss whether East Brown would take licking him. He called Slogger Williams, force supposed he could hit. In main, he rough, goodnatured fellow enough, much alive his dignity. He reckoned king form, kept his position strong hand, especially matter forcing boys construe legitimate forty lines. He already grunted grumbled Arthur went reading beyond forty lines; he broken middle long words, Slogger's wrath fairly roused. “Sneaking little brute,” muttered he, regardless prudence--“clapping water-works hardest place; see I do not punch his head fourth lesson.” “Whose?” said Tom, remark seemed addressed. “Why, little sneak, Arthur's,” replied Williams. “No, shall not,” said Tom. “Hullo!” exclaimed Williams, looking Tom great surprise moment, giving sudden dig ribs his elbow, sent Tom's books flying floor, called attention master, turned suddenly round, seeing state things, said,-- “Williams, go three places, go on.” The Slogger found his legs slowly, proceeded go Tom two boys great disgust; then, turning round facing master, said, “I have not learnt more, sir; lesson forty lines.” “Is so?” said master, appealing generally top bench. No answer. “Who head boy form?” said he, waxing wroth. “Arthur, sir,” answered three four boys, indicating friend. “Oh, name's Arthur. Well, now, length regular lesson?” Arthur hesitated moment, said, “We call forty lines, sir.” “How mean--you call it?” “Well, sir, Mr. Graham says are not stop there is time construe more.” “I understand,” said master.--“Williams, go three places, write lesson Greek English. And now, Arthur, finish construing.” “Oh! would I Arthur's shoes fourth lesson?” said little boys one another; Arthur finished Helen's speech without catastrophe, clock struck four, ended third lesson. Another hour occupied preparing saying fourth lesson, Williams bottling his wrath; five struck, lessons day over, he prepared take summary vengeance innocent his misfortune. Tom detained school minutes rest, coming quadrangle, first thing he saw small ring boys, applauding Williams, holding Arthur collar. “There, young sneak,” said he, giving Arthur cuff head his hand; “what made say that--” “Hullo!” said Tom, shouldering crowd; “you drop that, Williams; shall not touch him.” “Who will stop me?” said Slogger, raising his hand again. “I,” said Tom; suiting action word he struck arm held Arthur's arm sharply Slogger dropped start, turned full current his wrath Tom. “Will fight?” “Yes, course.” “Huzza! There is going fight Slogger Williams Tom Brown!” The news ran like wildfire about, many boys way tea several houses turned back, sought back chapel, fights come off. “Just run tell East come back me,” said Tom small School-house boy, like rocket Harrowell's, stopping moment poke his head School-house hall, lower boys already tea, sing out, “Fight! Tom Brown Slogger Williams.” Up start half boys once, leaving bread, eggs, butter, sprats, rest take care themselves. The greater part remainder follow minute, swallowing tea, carrying food hands consume go. Three four remain, steal butter impetuous, make unctuous feast. In another minute East Martin tear quadrangle, carrying sponge, arrive scene action combatants beginning strip. Tom felt he got his work cut him, he stripped his jacket, waistcoat, braces. East tied his handkerchief round his waist, rolled his shirtsleeves him. “Now, old boy, do not open mouth say word, try help bit--we will that; keep breath strength Slogger.” Martin meanwhile folded clothes, put chapel rails; Tom, East handle him, Martin give knee, steps turf, ready may come; Slogger too, stripped, thirsting fray. It does not look fair match first glance: Williams nearly two inches taller, probably long year older his opponent, he strongly made arms shoulders--“peels well,” little knot big fifth-form boys, amateurs, say, stand outside ring little boys, looking complacently on, taking active part proceedings. But he good means--no spring loins, feeblish, say shipwrecky, knees. Tom, contrary, though half strong arms, good over, straight, hard, springy, neck ankle, better perhaps his legs anywhere. Besides, see clear white his eye, fresh, bright look his skin, he tip-top training, able he knows; Slogger looks rather sodden, he did not take much exercise ate much tuck. The time-keeper chosen, large ring made, two stand opposite one another moment, giving us time make little observations. “If Tom'll condescend fight his head heels,” East mutters Martin, “we shall do.” But seemingly he will not, he goes in, making play hands. Hard word; two stand one another like men; rally follows rally quick succession, fighting he thought finish whole thing hand. “Cannot last rate,” say knowing ones, partisans make air ring shouts counter-shouts encouragement, approval, defiance. “Take easy, take easy; keep away; let come you,” implores East, he wipes Tom's face first round wet sponge, he sits back Martin's knee, supported Madman's long arms tremble little excitement. “Time's up,” calls time-keeper. “There he goes again, hang all!” growls East, his man again, hard ever. A severe round follows, Tom gets worst it, last hit clean his legs, deposited grass right-hander Slogger. Loud shouts rise boys Slogger's house, School-house silent vicious, ready pick quarrels anywhere. “Two one half-crowns big un,” says Rattle, one amateurs, tall fellow, thunder-and-lightning waistcoat, puffy, good-natured face. “Done!” says Groove, another amateur quieter look, taking his notebook enter it, friend Rattle sometimes forgets little things. Meantime East freshening Tom sponges next round, set two boys rub his hands. “Tom, old boy,” whispers he, “this may fun you, it is death me. He will hit fight another five minutes, I shall go drown island ditch. Feint him; use legs; draw about. He will lose his wind time, go him. Hit his body too; we will take care his frontispiece by-and-by.” Tom felt wisdom counsel, saw already he could not go finish Slogger mere hammer tongs, changed his tactics completely third round. He fights cautiously, getting away parrying Slogger's lunging hits, instead trying counter, leading his enemy dance round ring him. “He is funking; go in, Williams,” “Catch up,” “Finish off,” scream small boys Slogger party. “Just want,” thinks East, chuckling himself, he sees Williams, excited shouts, thinking game his hands, blowing his exertions get close quarters again, Tom keeping away perfect ease. They quarter ground again, Tom always defensive. The Slogger pulls last moment, fairly blown. “Now, then, Tom,” sings East, dancing delight. Tom goes twinkling, hits two heavy body blows, gets away Slogger catch his wind, he he rushes blind fury Tom, skilfully parried avoided, overreaches falls his face, amidst terrific cheers School-house boys. “Double two one?” says Groove Rattle, notebook hand. “Stop bit,” says hero, looking uncomfortably Williams, puffing away his second's knee, winded enough, little worse way. After another round Slogger seems see he cannot go win right off, met his match thereabouts. So he begins use his head, tries make Tom lose his patience, come his time. And fight sways on, one getting trifling pull. Tom's face begins look one-sided--there little queer bumps his forehead, his mouth bleeding; East keeps wet sponge going scientifically he comes looking fresh bright ever. Williams slightly marked face, nervous movement his elbows see Tom's body blows telling. In fact, half vice Slogger's hitting neutralized, he dare not lunge freely fear exposing his sides. It interesting time much shouting, whole ring quiet. “All right, Tommy,” whispers East; “hold on's horse that is win. We have got last. Keep head, old boy.” But Arthur time? Words cannot paint poor little fellow's distress. He could not muster courage come ring, wandered great fives court corner chapel rails, trying make his mind throw them, try stop them; thinking running telling his friend Mary, who, he knew, would instantly report Doctor. The stories he heard men killed prize-fights rose horribly him. Once only, shouts “Well done, Brown!” “Huzza School-house!” rose higher ever, he ventured ring, thinking victory won. Catching sight Tom's face state I described, fear consequences vanishing his mind; he rushed straight matron's room, beseeching her get fight stopped, he die. But it is time us get back close. What fierce tumult confusion? The ring broken, high angry words bandied about. “It is fair”--“It is not”--“No hugging!” The fight stopped. The combatants, however, sit quietly, tended seconds, adherents wrangle middle. East cannot help shouting challenges two three side, though he never leaves Tom moment, plies sponges fast ever. The fact is, end last round, Tom, seeing good opening, closed his opponent, moment's struggle, thrown heavily, help fall he learnt his village rival Vale White Horse. Williams had not ghost chance Tom wrestling; conviction broke Slogger faction allowed man must licked. There strong feeling School catching hold throwing, though generally ruled fair within limits; ring broken fight stopped. The School-house overruled--the fight again, throwing; East, high wrath, threatens take his man away next round (which he do not mean do, way), suddenly young Brooke comes small gate end chapel. The School-house faction rush him. “Oh, hurrah! shall get fair play.” “Please, Brooke, come up. They will not let Tom Brown throw him.” “Throw whom?” says Brooke, coming ring. “Oh! Williams, I see. Nonsense! Of course he may throw him, he catches fairly waist.” Now, young Brooke, you are sixth, know, ought stop fights. He looks hard boys. “Anything wrong?” says he East, nodding Tom. “Not bit.” “Not beat all?” “Bless you, no! Heaps fight him.--Are not there, Tom?” Tom looks Brooke grins. “How is he?” nodding Williams. “So so; rather done, I think, since his last fall. He will not stand two more.” “Time's up!” The boys rise face one another. Brooke cannot find his heart stop yet, round goes on, Slogger waiting Tom, reserving his strength hit he come wrestling dodge again, he feels must stopped, his sponge soon go air. And another newcomer appears field, wit, under-porter, his long brush great wooden receptacle dust his arm. He sweeping schools. “You would better stop, gentlemen,” he says; “the Doctor knows Brown's fighting--he will minute.” “You go Bath, Bill,” excellent servitor gets his advice; man his hands, stanch upholder School-house, cannot help stopping look bit, see Tom Brown, pet craftsman, fight round. It grim earnest now, mistake. Both boys feel this, summon every power head, hand, eye aid. A piece luck either side, foot slipping, blow getting well home, another fall, may decide it. Tom works slowly round opening; he legs, choose his time. The Slogger waits attack, hopes finish heavy right-handed blow. As quarter slowly ground, evening sun comes behind cloud falls full Williams's face. Tom darts in; heavy right hand delivered, grazes his head. A short rally close quarters, close; another moment Slogger thrown heavily third time. “I will give three two little one half-crowns,” said Groove Rattle. “No, thank 'ee,” answers other, diving his hands farther his coat-tails. Just stage proceedings, door turret leads Doctor's library suddenly opens, he steps close, makes straight ring, Brown Slogger seated seconds' knees last time. “The Doctor! Doctor!” shouts small boy catches sight him, ring melts away seconds, small boys tearing off, Tom collaring his jacket waistcoat, slipping little gate chapel, round corner Harrowell's his backers, lively need be; Williams his backers making quite fast across close; Groove, Rattle, bigger fellows trying combine dignity prudence comical manner, walking fast enough, hope, recognized, fast enough look like running away. Young Brooke alone remains ground time Doctor gets there, touches his hat, without slight inward qualm. “Hah! Brooke. I surprised see here. Do not know I expect sixth stop fighting?” Brooke felt much uncomfortable he expected, he rather favourite Doctor his openness plainness speech, blurted out, he walked Doctor's side, already turned back,-- “Yes, sir, generally. But I thought wished us exercise discretion matter too--not interfere soon.” “But fighting half-hour more,” said Doctor. “Yes, sir; neither hurt. And they are sort boys who will better friends now, would not stopped, earlier--before equal.” “Who fighting Brown?” said Doctor. “Williams, sir, Thompson's. He bigger Brown, best first, came up, sir. There is good deal jealousy house Thompson's, would fights had not let go on, either much worst it.” “Well but, Brooke,” said Doctor, “does not look little exercised discretion stopping fight School-house boy getting worst it?” Brooke, must confessed, felt rather gravelled. “Now remember,” added Doctor, he stopped turret-door, “this fight go on; you will see that. And I expect stop fights future once.” “Very well, sir,” said young Brooke, touching his hat, sorry see turret-door close behind Doctor's back. Meantime Tom stanchest his adherents reached Harrowell's, Sally bustling get late tea, Stumps sent Tew, butcher, get piece raw beef Tom's eye, healed off-hand, he might show well morning. He bit worse, except slight difficulty his vision, singing his ears, sprained thumb, he kept cold-water bandage, he drank lots tea, listened babel voices talking speculating nothing fight, Williams would given another fall (which he did not least believe), earth Doctor could got know it--such bad luck! He could not help thinking he glad he had not won; he liked better was, felt friendly Slogger. And poor little Arthur crept sat quietly near him, kept looking raw beef plaintive looks Tom last burst laughing. “Do not make eyes, young un,” said he; “there is nothing matter.” “Oh, but, Tom, much hurt? I cannot bear thinking me.” “Not bit it; do not flatter yourself. We sure sooner later.” “Well, will not go on, you? You will promise will not go on?” “Cannot tell that--all depends houses. We are hands countrymen, know. Must fight School-house flag, be.” However, lovers science doomed disappointment time. Directly locking-up, one night-fags knocked Tom's door. “Brown, young Brooke wants sixth-form room.” Up went Tom summons, found magnates sitting supper. “Well, Brown,” said young Brooke, nodding him, “how feel?” “Oh, well, thank you, I have sprained thumb, I think.” “Sure fight. Well, had not worst it, I could see. Where learn throw?” “Down country I boy.” “Hullo! why, now? Well, never mind, you are plucky fellow. Sit supper.” Tom obeyed, means loath. And fifth-form boy next filled tumbler bottled beer, he ate drank, listening pleasant talk, wondering soon he fifth, one much-envied society. As he got leave, Brooke said, “You must shake hands to-morrow morning; I shall come see done first lesson.” And he did. And Tom Slogger shook hands great satisfaction mutual respect. And next year two, whenever fights talked of, small boys present shook heads wisely, saying, “Ah! seen fight Slogger Williams Tom Brown!” And now, boys all, three words quit subject. I put chapter fighting malice prepense, partly I want give true picture everyday school life time, kid-glove go-to-meeting-coat picture, partly cannot twaddle that is talked boxing fighting fists nowadays. Even Thackeray given it; weeks ago rampant stuff Times subject, article field sports. Boys quarrel, quarrel sometimes fight. Fighting fists natural English way English boys settle quarrels. What substitute there, ever there, amongst nation sun? What would like see take place? Learn box, then, learn play cricket football. Not one worse, much better, learning box well. Should never use earnest, there is exercise world good temper muscles back legs. As fighting, keep can, means. When time comes, ever should, say “Yes” “No” challenge fight, say “No” can--only take care make clear say “No.” It is proof highest courage, done true Christian motives. It is quite right justifiable, done simple aversion physical pain danger. But do not say “No” fear licking, say think it is fear God, that is neither Christian honest. And fight, fight out; do not give stand see. CHAPTER VI--FEVER IN THE SCHOOL. “This hope that is mortal And shall burst bond; Death keeps watch beside portal, But it is life dwells beyond.” --JOHN STERLING. Two years passed since events recorded last chapter, end summer half-year drawing on. Martin left gone cruise South Pacific, one his uncle's ships; old magpie, disreputable ever, his last bequest Arthur, lives joint study. Arthur nearly sixteen, head twenty, gone school rate form half-year. East Tom much deliberate progress, little way fifth form. Great strapping boys are, still thorough boys, filling place house young Brooke filled new boys, much sort fellows. Constant intercourse Arthur done much them, especially Tom; much remains yet done, get good Rugby got times. Arthur still frail delicate, spirit body; but, thanks his intimacy Martin, learned swim, run, play cricket, never hurt much reading. One evening, sitting supper fifth-form room, one started report fever broken one boarding-houses. “They say,” he added, “that Thompson ill, Dr. Robertson sent Northampton.” “Then shall sent home,” cried another. “Hurrah! five weeks' extra holidays, fifth-form examination!” “I hope not,” said Tom; “there will Marylebone match end half.” Some thought one thing, another, many did not believe report; next day, Tuesday, Dr. Robertson arrived, stayed day, long conferences Doctor. On Wednesday morning, prayers, Doctor addressed whole school. There several cases fever different houses, he said; Dr. Robertson, careful examination, assured infectious, proper care taken, could reason stopping school-work present. The examinations coming on, would unadvisable break now. However, boys chose liberty write home, and, parents wished it, leave once. He send whole school home fever spread. The next day Arthur sickened, case. Before end week thirty forty boys gone, rest stayed on. There general wish please Doctor, feeling cowardly run away. On Saturday Thompson died, bright afternoon, cricket-match going usual big-side ground. The Doctor, coming his deathbed, passed along gravel-walk side close, one knew happened till next day. At morning lecture began rumoured, afternoon chapel known generally; feeling seriousness awe actual presence death among came whole school. In long years his ministry Doctor perhaps never spoke words sank deeper day's sermon. “When I came yesterday visiting death-bed taken us, looked around upon familiar objects scenes within ground, common amusements going common cheerfulness activity, I felt nothing painful witnessing that; seem way shocking tune feelings sight dying Christian must supposed awaken. The unsuitableness point natural feeling scenes mourning scenes liveliness present itself. But I feel moment faults brought sometimes occur amongst us; I heard guilty falsehood, drunkenness, sin; I heard quarter language profaneness, unkindness, indecency; I heard seen signs wretched folly courts laugh fools affecting dread evil care good, unsuitableness things scene I quitted would indeed intensely painful. And why? Not things would really worse time, moment eyes opened really know good evil, feel live death becomes infinite blessing, live also good us never born.” Tom gone chapel sickening anxiety Arthur, he came cheered strengthened grand words, walked alone study. And he sat looked round, saw Arthur's straw hat cricket-jacket hanging pegs, marked his little neat arrangements, one disturbed, tears indeed rolled his cheeks; calm blessed tears, he repeated himself, “Yes, Geordie's eyes opened; he knows live death becomes infinite blessing. But I? O God, I bear lose him?” The week passed mournfully away. No boys sickened, Arthur reported worse day, his mother arrived early week. Tom made many appeals allowed see him, several times tried get sick-room; housekeeper always way, last spoke Doctor, kindly peremptorily forbade him. Thompson buried Tuesday, burial service, soothing grand always, beyond words solemn read boy's grave his companions, brought much comfort, many strange new thoughts longings. He went back his regular life, played cricket bathed usual. It seemed right thing do, new thoughts longings became brave healthy effort. The crisis came Saturday; day week Thompson died; long afternoon Tom sat his study reading his Bible, going every half-hour housekeeper's room, expecting time hear gentle brave little spirit gone home. But God work Arthur do. The crisis passed: Sunday evening he declared danger; Monday he sent message Tom he almost well, changed his room, allowed see next day. It evening housekeeper summoned sick-room. Arthur lying sofa open window, rays western sun stole gently, lighting his white face golden hair. Tom remembered German picture angel he knew; often he thought transparent golden spirit-like was; he shuddered, think like Arthur looked, felt shock his blood stopped short, he realized near world his friend must look like that. Never till moment he felt his little chum twined round his heart-strings, he stole gently across room knelt down, put his arm round Arthur's head pillow, felt ashamed half-angry his red brown face, bounding sense health power filled every fibre his body, made every movement mere living joy him. He need not troubled himself: strength power different his drew Arthur him. Arthur laid his thin, white hand, blue veins stood plainly, Tom's great brown fist, smiled him; looked window again, he could not bear lose moment sunset, tops great feathery elms, round rooks circling clanging, returning flocks evening's foraging parties. The elms rustled, sparrows ivy outside window chirped fluttered about, quarrelling, making again; rooks, young old, talked chorus, merry shouts boys sweet click cricket-bats came cheerily below. “Dear George,” said Tom, “I glad let see last. I have tried hard come often, would not let before.” “Oh, I know, Tom; Mary told every day you, she obliged make Doctor speak keep away. I am glad did not get up, might caught it; could not stand ill, matches going on. And you are eleven, too, I hear. I am glad.” “Yes; are not jolly?” said Tom proudly. “I am ninth too. I made forty last pie-match, caught three fellows out. So I put Jones Tucker. Tucker's savage, he head twenty-two.” “Well, I think ought higher yet,” said Arthur, jealous renown Tom games Tom his scholar. “Never mind. I do not care cricket anything you are getting well, Geordie; I should not hurt, I know, they would let come up. Nothing hurts me. But you will get directly, will not you? You will not believe clean I have kept study. All things left them; I feed old magpie used, though I come big-side him, old rip. He will not look pleased I do, sticks his head first one side other, blinks he will begin eat, till I am half inclined box his ears. And whenever East comes in, see hop window, dot go one, though Harry would not touch feather now.” Arthur laughed. “Old Gravey good memory; he cannot forget sieges poor Martin's den old times.” He paused moment, went on: “You cannot think often I have thinking old Martin since I have ill. I suppose one's mind gets restless, likes wander strange, unknown places. I wonder queer new pets old boy got. How he must revelling thousand new birds, beasts, fishes!” Tom felt pang jealousy, kicked moment. “Fancy South Sea island, Cherokees, Patagonians, wild niggers!” (Tom's ethnology geography faulty, sufficient his needs.) “They will make old Madman cock medicine-man, tattoo over. Perhaps he is cutting blue, squaw wigwam. He will improve boomerangs, able throw too, without old Thomas sent Doctor take away.” Arthur laughed remembrance boomerang story, looked grave again, said, “He will convert island, I know.” “Yes, he do not blow first.” “Do remember, Tom, East used laugh chaff him, he said he sure rooks calling-over prayers, something sort, locking-up bell rang? Well, I declare,” said Arthur, looking seriously Tom's laughing eyes, “I think he right. Since I have lying here, I have watched every night; and, know, really come perch, them, locking-up time; first there is regular chorus caws; stop bit, one old fellow, perhaps two three different trees, caw solos; go again, fluttering cawing anyhow till roost.” “I wonder old blackies talk,” said Tom, looking them. “How must abuse East, pray Doctor stopping slinging!” “There! look, look!” cried Arthur; “do not see old fellow without tail coming up? Martin used call 'clerk.' He cannot steer himself. You never saw fun he high wind, he cannot steer home, gets carried right past trees, bear he perch.” The locking-up bell began toll, two boys silent, listened it. The sound soon carried Tom river woods, he began go his mind many occasions he heard toll coming faintly breeze, pack his rod hurry make run it, get gates shut. He roused start his memories Arthur's voice, gentle weak his late illness. “Tom, angry I talk seriously?” “No, dear old boy, I. But are not faint, Arthur, ill? What I get you? Do not say anything hurt now--you weak; let come again.” “No, no; I shall not hurt myself. I would sooner speak now, do not mind. I have asked Mary tell Doctor me, need not go calling-over; I may not another chance, I shall likely go home change air get well, may not come back half.” “Oh, think must go away end half? I am sorry. It is five weeks yet holidays, fifth-form examination half cricket-matches come yet. And shall I time alone study? Why, Arthur, twelve weeks I see again. Oh, hang it, I cannot stand that! Besides who is keep working examination books? I shall come bottom form, sure eggs eggs.” Tom rattling on, half joke, half earnest, he wanted get Arthur his serious vein, thinking would harm; Arthur broke in,-- “Oh, please, Tom, stop, you will drive I say head. And I am already horribly afraid I am going make angry.” “Do not gammon, young un,” rejoined Tom (the use old name, dear old recollections, made Arthur start smile feel quite happy); “you know are not afraid, you have never made angry since first month chummed together. Now I am going quite sober quarter hour, I year; make it; heave ahead, pitch right left.” “Dear Tom, I are not going pitch you,” said Arthur piteously; “and seems cocky advising you, who have backbone ever since I have Rugby, made school paradise me. Ah, I see I shall never it, unless I go head heels once, said taught swim. Tom, I want give using vulgus-books cribs.” Arthur sank back his pillow sigh, effort great; worst over, he looked straight Tom, evidently taken aback. He leant his elbows his knees, stuck his hands his hair, whistled verse “Billy Taylor,” quite silent another minute. Not shade crossed his face, he clearly puzzled. At last he looked up, caught Arthur's anxious look, took his hand, said simply,-- “Why, young un?” “Because you are honestest boy Rugby, are not honest.” “I do not see that.” “What sent Rugby for?” “Well, I do not know exactly--nobody ever told me. I suppose boys sent public school England.” “But think yourself? What want here, carry away?” Tom thought minute. “I want A1 cricket football, games, make hands keep head fellow, lout gentleman. I want get sixth I leave, please Doctor; I want carry away much Latin Greek take Oxford respectably. There, now, young un; I never thought before, that is pretty much figure. Are not square? What got say that?” “Why, pretty sure want, then.” “Well, I hope so. But you have forgot one thing--what I want leave behind me. I want leave behind me,” said Tom, speaking slow, looking much moved, “the name fellow never bullied little boy, turned his back big one.” Arthur pressed his hand, moment's silence went on, “You say, Tom, want please Doctor. Now, want please he thinks do, really do?” “By I really do, course.” “Does he think use cribs vulgus-books?” Tom felt his flank turned, he could not give in. “He Winchester himself,” said he; “he knows it.” “Yes; he think use them? Do think he approves it?” “You young villain!” said Tom, shaking his fist Arthur, half vexed half pleased, “I never think it. Hang it! there, perhaps he do not. Well, I suppose he do not.” Arthur saw he got his point; he knew his friend well, wise silence speech. He said, “I would sooner doctor's good opinion I really man's world.” After another minute, Tom began again, “Look here, young un. How earth I get time play matches half I give cribs? We are middle long crabbed chorus Agamemnon. I make head tail crib. Then there is Pericles's speech coming Thucydides, 'The Birds' get examination, besides Tacitus.” Tom groaned thought his accumulated labours. “I say, young un, there is five weeks left holidays. May not I go usual half? I will tell Doctor day, may.” Arthur looked window. The twilight come on, silent. He repeated low voice: “In thing Lord pardon thy servant, master goeth house Rimmon worship there, he leaneth hand, I bow house Rimmon, I bow house Rimmon, Lord pardon thy servant thing.” Not word said subject, boys silent--one blessed, short silences resolves colour life often taken. Tom first break it. “You have ill indeed, have not you, Geordie?” said he, mixture awe curiosity, feeling his friend strange place scene, he could form idea, full memory his thoughts last week. “Yes, very. I am sure Doctor thought I going die. He gave Sacrament last Sunday, cannot think he one ill. He said brave, tender, gentle things me, I felt quite light strong it, never fear. My mother brought old medical man, attended I poor sickly child. He said constitution quite changed, I am fit anything now. If had not, I could not stood three days illness. That is thanks you, games you have made fond of.” “More thanks old Martin,” said Tom; “he is real friend.” “Nonsense, Tom; he never could done have.” “Well, I do not know; I little enough. Did tell you--you will not mind hearing now, I know--that poor Thompson died last week? The three boys getting quite round, like you.” “Oh yes, I heard it.” Then Tom, quite full it, told Arthur burial-service chapel, impressed him, and, he believed, boys. “And though Doctor never said word it,” said he, “and half-holiday match-day, was not game played close afternoon, boys went Sunday.” “I am glad it,” said Arthur. “But, Tom, I have strange thoughts death lately. I have never told soul them, even mother. Sometimes I think they are wrong, but, know, I do not think heart I could sorry death friends.” Tom taken quite aback. “What world young un now?” thought he; “I have swallowed good many his crotchets, altogether beats me. He cannot quite right his head.” He did not want say word, shifted uneasily dark; however, Arthur seemed waiting answer, last he said, “I do not think I quite see mean, Geordie. One's told often think death I have tried sometimes, especially last week. But will not talk now. I would better go. You are getting tired, I shall harm.” “No, no; indeed I are not, Tom. You must stop till nine; there is twenty minutes. I have settled shall stop till nine. And oh! let talk you--I must talk you. I see it is I feared. You think I am half mad. Do not you, now?” “Well, I think odd said, Geordie, ask me.” Arthur paused moment, said quickly, “I will tell happened. At first, I sent sick-room, found I really got fever, I terribly frightened. I thought I die, I could face moment. I do not think sheer cowardice first, I thought hard taken away mother sisters all, I beginning see way many things, feel I might man man's work. To die without fought, worked, given one's life away, hard bear. I got terribly impatient, accused God injustice, strove justify myself. And harder I strove deeper I sank. Then image dear father often came across me, I turned it. Whenever came, heavy, numbing throb seemed take hold heart, say, 'Dead-dead-dead.' And I cried out, 'The living, living shall praise Thee, O God; dead cannot praise thee. There work grave; night man work. But I work. I great things. I great things. Why wilt thou slay me?' And I struggled plunged, deeper deeper, went living black tomb. I alone there, power stir think; alone myself; beyond reach human fellowship; beyond Christ's reach, I thought, nightmare. You, brave bright strong, idea agony. Pray God never may. Pray life.” Arthur stopped--from exhaustion, Tom thought; his fear lest Arthur hurt himself, his awe, his longing go on, he could not ask, stir help him. Presently he went on, quite calm slow. “I do not know long I state--for day, I know; I quite conscious, lived outer life time, took medicines, spoke mother, heard said. But I did not take much note time. I thought time me, tomb beyond. Well, last Sunday morning, I seemed lie tomb, alone, I thought, ever ever, black, dead wall cleft two, I caught borne light great power, living, mighty spirit. Tom, remember living creatures wheels Ezekiel? It like that. 'When went, I heard noise wings, like noise great waters, voice Almighty, voice speech, noise host; stood, let wings.' 'And went every one straight forward: whither spirit go, went; turned went.' And rushed bright air, full myriads living creatures, paused brink great river. And power held up, I knew great river grave, death dwelt there, death I met black tomb. That, I felt, gone ever. For bank great river I saw men women children rising pure bright, tears wiped eyes, put glory strength, weariness pain fell away. And beyond multitude man could number, worked great work; rose river went joined work. They worked, worked different way, work. And I saw father, men old town I knew I child--many hard, stern man, never came church, called atheist infidel. There were, side side father, I seen toil die them, women little children, seal foreheads all. And I longed see work was, could not; I tried plunge river, I thought I would join them, I could not. Then I looked see got river. And I could see, I saw myriads side, worked, I knew work, seal foreheads. And though I saw toil anguish work these, working blind feeble, yet I longed plunge river, know work was. And I looked I saw mother sisters, I saw Doctor, you, Tom, hundreds I knew; last I saw too, I toiling ever little piece great work. Then melted away, power left me, left I thought I heard voice say, 'The vision appointed time; though tarry, wait it, end shall speak lie, shall surely come, shall tarry.' It early morning I know, then--it quiet cool, mother fast asleep chair bedside; was not dream mine. I know was not dream. Then I fell deep sleep, woke afternoon chapel; Doctor came gave Sacrament, I told you. I told mother I get well--I knew I should; I could not tell why. Tom,” said Arthur gently, another minute, “do see I could grieve see dearest friend die? It cannot be--it is not--all fever illness. God would never let see clear was not true. I do not understand yet; take life longer that--to find work is.” When Arthur stopped long pause. Tom could speak; he almost afraid breathe, lest he break train Arthur's thoughts. He longed hear more, ask questions. In another minute nine of the clock struck, gentle tap door called back world again. They answer, however, moment; door opened, lady came carrying candle. She went straight sofa, took hold Arthur's hand, stooped kissed him. “My dearest boy, feel little feverish again. Why did not lights? You have talked much, excited dark.” “Oh no, mother; cannot think well I feel. I shall start to-morrow Devonshire. But, mother, here is friend--here is Tom Brown. You know him?” “Yes, indeed; I have known years,” she said, held her hand Tom, standing behind sofa. This Arthur's mother: tall slight fair, masses golden hair drawn back broad, white forehead, calm blue eye meeting his deep open--the eye he knew well, his friend's again, lovely, tender mouth trembled he looked--she stood there, woman thirty-eight, old enough his mother, one whose face showed lines must written faces good men's wives widows, he thought he never seen anything beautiful. He could not help wondering Arthur's sisters like her. Tom held her hand, looked straight her face; he could neither let go speak. “Now, Tom,” said Arthur, laughing, “where manners? You will stare mother countenance.” Tom dropped little hand sigh. “There, sit down, you.--Here, dearest mother; there is room here.” And he made place sofa her.--“Tom, need not go; I am sure will not called first lesson.” Tom felt he would risk floored every lesson rest his natural school-life sooner go, sat down. “And now,” said Arthur, “I realized one dearest wishes life--to see two together.” And he led away talk home Devonshire, red, bright earth, deep green combes, peat streams like cairngorm pebbles, wild moor high, cloudy tors giant background picture, till Tom got jealous, stood clear chalk streams, emerald water meadows great elms willows dear old royal county, he gloried call it. And mother sat quiet loving, rejoicing life. The quarter ten struck, bell rang bed, well begun talk, seemed. Then Tom rose sigh go. “Shall I see morning, Geordie?” said he, he shook his friend's hand. “Never mind, though; you will back next half. And I shall not forget house Rimmon.” Arthur's mother got walked door, gave her hand again; his eyes met deep, loving look, like spell upon him. Her voice trembled slightly she said, “Good-night. You one knows Father promised friend widow fatherless. May He deal dealt mine!” Tom quite upset; he mumbled something owing everything good Geordie, looked her face again, pressed her hand his lips, rushed downstairs his study, he sat till old Thomas came kicking door, tell his allowance would stopped he did not go bed. (It would stopped anyhow, he great favourite old gentleman, loved come afternoons close Tom's wicket, bowl slow twisters him, talk glories bygone Surrey heroes, he played former generations.) So Tom roused himself, took his candle go bed; first time aware beautiful new fishing-rod, old Eton's mark it, splendidly-bound Bible, lay his table, title-page written--“TOM BROWN, his affectionate grateful friends, Frances Jane Arthur; George Arthur.” I leave guess he slept, he dreamt of. CHAPTER VII--HARRY EAST'S DILEMMAS AND DELIVERANCES. “The Holy Supper kept indeed, In whatso share another's need Not give, share, For gift without giver bare. Who bestows his alms feeds three, Himself, his hungering neighbour Me.” --LOWELL, The Vision Sir Launfal. The next morning, breakfast, Tom, East, Gower met usual learn second lesson together. Tom considering break his proposal giving crib others, found better way (as indeed none better ever found man boy), told simply happened; he see Arthur, talked upon subject, he said, his part he made his mind, was not going use cribs more; quite sure his ground, took high pathetic tone, proceeding say “how that, learnt his lessons many years, would grieve much put end arrangement, he hoped, rate, would not go him, still good friends, respect one another's motives; but--” Here boys, listening open eyes ears, burst in,-- “Stuff nonsense!” cried Gower. “Here, East, get crib find place.” “O Tommy, Tommy!” said East, proceeding he bidden, “that ever come this! I knew Arthur'd ruin day, me. And time's come.” And he made doleful face. “I do not know ruin,” answered Tom; “I know I would sack long ago had not him. And know well I.” “Well, baddish way he came, I own; new crotchet his past joke.” “Let us give trial, Harry; come. You know often he right wrong.” “Now, do not two jawing away young Square-toes,” struck Gower. “He is end sucking wiseacre, I dare say; we have time lose, I have got fives court half-past nine.” “I say, Gower,” said Tom appealingly, “be good fellow, let us try cannot get without crib.” “What! chorus? Why, shall not get ten lines.” “I say, Tom,” cried East, hit new idea, “do not remember, upper fourth, old Momus caught construing leaf crib I would torn put book, would float floor, he sent flogged it?” “Yes, I remember well.” “Well, Doctor, he would flogged me, told he did not flog using translation, taking lesson, using I had not learnt word I came in. He said harm using translation get clue hard passages, tried could first make without.” “Did he, though?” said Tom; “then Arthur must wrong.” “Of course he is,” said Gower--“the little prig. We will use crib cannot construe without it.--Go ahead, East.” And agreement started--Tom, satisfied made his confession, sorry locus penitentiae, deprived altogether use his old faithful friend. The boys went usual, taking sentence turn, crib handed one whose turn construe. Of course Tom could not object this, as, simply lying appealed case sentence prove hard altogether construer? But must owned Gower East make tremendous exertions conquer sentences recourse help. Tom, however, heroic virtue gallantry, rushed his sentence, searching high-minded manner nominative verb, turning his dictionary frantically first hard word stopped him. But meantime Gower, bent getting fives, would peep quietly crib, suggest, “Do not think meaning?” “I think must take way, Brown.” And Tom did not see his way profiting suggestions, lesson went quickly usual, Gower able start fives court within five minutes half-hour. When Tom East left face face, looked one another minute, Tom puzzled, East chokefull fun, burst roar laughter. “Well, Tom,” said East, recovering himself, “I see objection new way. It is good old one, I think, besides advantage gives one feeling virtuous, looking one's neighbours.” Tom shoved his hand his back hair. “I are not sure,” said he; “you two fellows carried legs. I do not think really tried one sentence fairly. Are sure remember Doctor said you?” “Yes. And I will swear I could not make one sentences to-day--no, ever could. I really do not remember,” said East, speaking slowly impressively, “to come across one Latin Greek sentence half I could go construe light nature. Whereby I sure Providence intended cribs used.” “The thing find out,” said Tom meditatively, “is long one ought grind sentence without looking crib. Now I think one fairly looks words one do not know, cannot hit it, that is enough.” “To sure, Tommy,” said East demurely, merry twinkle his eye. “Your new doctrine too, old fellow,” added he, “when one comes think it, cutting root school morality. You will take away mutual help, brotherly love, or, vulgar tongue, giving construes, I hold one highest virtues. For distinguish getting construe another boy using crib? Hang it, Tom, you are going deprive school-fellows chance exercising Christian benevolence good Samaritans, I shall cut concern.” “I wish would not joke it, Harry; it is hard enough see one's way--a precious sight harder I thought last night. But I suppose there is use abuse both, one'll get straight enough somehow. But cannot make out, anyhow, one right use old vulgus-books copy-books.” “Hullo, heresy! How fast fellow goes downhill he gets his head his legs. Listen me, Tom. Not use old vulgus-books! Why, Goth, are not take benefit wisdom admire use work past generations? Not use old copy-books! Why, might well say ought pull Westminster Abbey, put go-to-meeting shop churchwarden windows; never read Shakespeare, Sheridan Knowles. Think work labour predecessors bestowed books; make work value?” “I say, Harry, please do not chaff; I am really serious.” “And then, duty consult pleasure others rather own, all, masters? Fancy, then, difference looking vulgus carefully touched retouched others, must bring sort dreamy pleasure, they would met thought expression somewhere another--before born perhaps--and cutting up, making picture-frames round false quantities, monstrosities. Why, Tom, would not cruel never let old Momus hum 'O genus humanum' again, look doubtingly his spectacles, end smiling giving three extra marks it--just old sake's sake, I suppose.” “Well,” said Tom, getting something like huff he capable of, “it is deuced hard fellow's really trying he ought, his best friends'll nothing chaff try put down.” And he stuck his books his arm his hat his head, preparatory rushing quadrangle, testify his soul faithlessness friendships. “Now do not ass, Tom,” said East, catching hold him; “you know well enough time; bark's worse bite. You cannot expect ride new crotchet without anybody's trying stick nettle his tail make kick off--especially shall go foot still. But sit down, let us go again. I will serious judge.” Then Tom sat table, waxed eloquent righteousnesses advantages new plan, his will not whenever he took anything, going his life depended upon it, sparing abuse he could think of, opposite method, he denounced ungentlemanly, cowardly, mean, lying, one knows besides. “Very cool Tom,” East thought, did not say, “seeing he came Egypt last night bedtime.” “Well, Tom,” said he last, “you see, I came school none sort notions. You may right--I dare say are. Only one always felt masters is, it is fair trial skill last us them--like match football battle. We are natural enemies school--that is fact. We have got learn much Latin Greek, many verses, they have got see it. If slip collar much less without getting caught, that is one us. If get us, catch us shirking, that is one them. All's fair war lying. If I run luck theirs, go school without looking lessons, do not get called up, I snob sneak? I do not tell master I have learnt it. He is got find whether I not. What is he paid for? If he calls I get floored, he makes write Greek English. Very good. He is caught me, I do not grumble. I grant you, I go snivel him, tell I have really tried learn it, found hard without translation, say I have toothache, humbug kind, I am snob. That is school morality; it is served me, too, Tom, matter that, five years. And it is clear fair, mistake it. We understand it, understand it, I do not know we are come other.” Tom looked pleased little puzzled. He never heard East speak his mind seriously before, could not help feeling completely he hit his theory practice time. “Thank you, old fellow,” said he. “You are good old brick serious, put me. I said I meant, I dare say, see I know I am right. Whatever Gower rest do, I shall hold on. I must. And it is new uphill game, see, one must hit hard hold tight first.” “Very good,” said East; “hold hit away, do not hit line.” “But I must bring over, Harry, I shall not comfortable. Now, I will allow you have said. We have always honourable enemies masters. We found state war came, went course. Only do not think things altered good deal? I do not feel I used masters. They seem treat one quite differently.” “Yes, perhaps do,” said East; “there is new set see, mostly, do not feel sure yet. They do not want fight till know ground.” “I do not think it is that,” said Tom. “And Doctor, he treat one openly, like gentleman, one working him.” “Well, he does,” said East; “he is splendid fellow, I get sixth I shall act accordingly. Only know he nothing lessons now, except examining us. I say, though,” looking his watch, “it is quarter. Come along.” As walked got message, say Arthur starting, would like say goodbye. So went private entrance School-house, found open carriage, Arthur propped pillows it, looking already better, Tom thought. They jumped steps shake hands him, Tom mumbled thanks presents he found his study, looked round anxiously Arthur's mother. East, fallen back his usual humour, looked quaintly Arthur, said,-- “So you have again, hot-headed convert there. He is making lives burden us morning using cribs. I shall get floored certainty second lesson, I am called up.” Arthur blushed looked down. Tom struck in,-- “Oh, it is right. He is converted already; he always comes mud us, grumbling sputtering.” The clock struck, go school, wishing Arthur pleasant holiday, Tom, lingering behind moment send his thanks love Arthur's mother. Tom renewed discussion second lesson, succeeded far get East promise give new plan fair trial. Encouraged his success, evening, sitting alone large study, East lived almost, “vice Arthur leave,” examining new fishing-rod, pronounced genuine article (“play enough throw midge tied single hair wind, strength enough hold grampus”), naturally began talking Arthur. Tom, still bubbling last night's scene thoughts last week, wanting clinch fix whole his mind, he could never without first going process belabouring somebody else all, suddenly rushed subject Arthur's illness, he said death. East given desired opening. After serio-comic grumble, “that life was not worth having, tied young beggar always 'raising his standard;' he, East, like prophet's donkey, obliged struggle donkey-man went prophet; he none pleasure starting new crotchets, did not half understand them, take kicks carry luggage he fun,” he threw his legs sofa, put his hands behind his head, said,-- “Well, all, he is wonderful little fellow I ever came across. There are not meek, humble boy school. Hanged I do not think now, really, Tom, he believes much worse fellow I, he do not think he influence house Dot Bowles, came last quarter, is not ten yet. But he turns round his little finger, old boy--there is mistake that.” And East nodded Tom sagaciously. “Now never!” thought Tom; so, shutting his eyes hardening his heart, he went straight it, repeating Arthur said, near he could remember it, words, he thought. The life seemed ooze he went on, several times he felt inclined stop, give up, change subject. But somehow he borne on; he necessity upon speak out, so. At end he looked East anxiety, delighted see young gentleman thoughtful attentive. The fact is, stage his inner life Tom lately arrived, his intimacy friendship East could lasted he made aware of, sharer in, thoughts beginning exercise him. Nor indeed could friendship lasted East shown sympathy thoughts; great relief unbosomed himself, found his friend could listen. Tom always sort instinct East's levity skin-deep, instinct true one. East want reverence anything he felt real; his one natures burst generally called recklessness impiety moment feel anything poured upon good come home inborn sense right, appeals anything like self-interest them. Daring honest nature, outspoken extent alarmed respectabilities, constant fund animal health spirits he feel bound curb way, he gained steady part school (including well wished appear steady really so) character boy would dangerous intimate; his hatred everything cruel, underhand, false, his hearty respect he would see good true, kept rest. Tom, besides like East many points character, largely developed his composition capacity taking weakest side. This putting strongly enough: necessity him; he could not help he could eating drinking. He could never play strongest side heart football cricket, sure make friends boy unpopular, his luck. Now, though East generally called unpopular, Tom felt every day, characters developed, he stood alone, make friends among contemporaries, therefore sought out. Tom much popular, his power detecting humbug much less acute, his instincts much sociable. He period his life, too, largely given taking people gave be; his singleness heart, fearlessness, honesty East appreciated, thus two drawn great intimacy. This intimacy interrupted Tom's guardianship Arthur. East often, said, joined reading Bible; discussions almost always turned upon characters men women read, become personal themselves. In fact, two shrunk personal religious discussion, knowing might end, fearful risking friendship dear both, felt somehow, without quite knowing why, would never same, either tenfold stronger sapped foundation, communing together. What bother explaining is! I wish could get without it. But cannot. However, you will find, have not found already, time comes every human friendship must go depths yourself, lay bare friend, wait fear his answer. A moments may it; may (most likely be, English boys) never once. But done must be, friendship worth name. You must find there, root bottom one another's hearts; one there, nothing earth least ought sunder you. East remained lying Tom finished speaking, fearing interrupt him; he sat table, leant his head one hand, taking pencil other, working little holes table-cover. After bit he looked up, stopped pencil, said, “Thank much, old fellow. There is boy house would done Arthur. I see well enough,” he went on, pause, “all best big fellows look suspicion; think I am devil-may-care, reckless young scamp. So I am--eleven hours twelve, twelfth. Then contemporaries worth knowing follow suit, course: we are good friends games that, soul Arthur ever tried break crust, see whether anything bottom me; bad ones I will not stand know that.” “Do not think that is half fancy, Harry?” “Not bit it,” said East bitterly, pegging away his pencil. “I see plain enough. Bless you, think everybody's straightforward kindhearted are.” “Well, what is reason it? There must reason. You play games well one sing best song, best company house. You fancy you are liked, Harry. It is fancy.” “I wish was, Tom. I know I could popular enough bad ones, I will not have, good ones will not me.” “Why not?” persisted Tom; “you do not drink swear, get night; never bully, cheat lessons. If showed liked it, you would best fellows house running you.” “Not I,” said East. Then effort he went on, “I will tell is. I never stop Sacrament. I see, Doctor downwards, tells me.” “Yes, I have seen that,” said Tom, “and I have sorry it, Arthur I talked it. I have often thought speaking you, it is hard begin subjects. I am glad you have opened it. Now, do not you?” “I have never confirmed,” said East. “Not confirmed!” said Tom, astonishment. “I never thought that. Why were not confirmed rest us nearly three years ago? I always thought you would confirmed home.” “No,” answered East sorrowfully; “you see happened. Last Confirmation soon Arthur came, taken I hardly saw either you. Well, Doctor sent round us it, I living mostly Green's set. You know sort. They went in. I dare say right, got good it; I do not want judge them. Only I could see reasons drove way. It Was 'because Doctor liked it;' 'no boy got did not stay Sacrament;' 'correct thing,' fact, like good hat wear Sundays. I could not stand it. I did not feel I wanted lead different life. I well content I was, I was not going sham religious curry favour Doctor, one else.” East stopped speaking, pegged away diligently ever his pencil. Tom ready cry. He felt half sorry first he confirmed himself. He seemed deserted his earliest friend--to left his worst need long years. He got went sat East, put his arm his shoulder. “Dear old boy,” he said, “how careless selfish I have been. But did not come talk Arthur me?” “I wish Heaven I had,” said East, “but I fool. It is late talking now.” “Why late? You want confirmed now, do not you?” “I think so,” said East. “I have thought good deal; only, often I fancy I must changing, I see it is good here--just stopped last time. And I go back again.” “I will tell it was me,” said Tom warmly. “If had not Arthur, I done did. I hope I should. I honour it. But he made taking weak side world--going everything that is strong rich, proud respectable, little band brothers whole world. And Doctor seemed say too, he said great deal more.” “Ah!” groaned East, “but again, that is another difficulties whenever I think matter. I do not want one saints, one elect, whatever right phrase is. My sympathies way--with many, poor devils run streets do not go church. Do not stare, Tom; mind, I am telling that is heart--as far I know it--but it is muddle. You must gentle want land me. Now I have seen deal sort religion; I bred it, I cannot stand it. If nineteen-twentieths world left uncovenanted mercies, sort thing, means plain English go hell, twentieth rejoice all, why--” “Oh! but, Harry, are not, do not,” broke Tom, really shocked. “Oh, I wish Arthur had not gone! I am fool things. But it is want too, East; indeed. It cuts ways somehow, confirmed taking Sacrament. It makes feel side good bad too, everybody world. Only there is great dark strong power, crushing everybody else. That is Christ conquered, we have got fight. What fool I am! I cannot explain. If Arthur here!” “I begin get glimmering mean,” said East. “I say, now,” said Tom eagerly, “do remember hated Flashman?” “Of course I do,” said East; “I hate still. What then?” “Well, I came take Sacrament, I great struggle that. I tried put head; I could not that, I tried think evil--as something Lord loving hated, I might hate too. But would not do. I broke down; I believe Christ Himself broke down. And Doctor gave bread wine, leant praying, I prayed poor Flashman, Arthur.” East buried his face his hands table. Tom could feel table tremble. At last he looked up. “Thank again, Tom,” said he; “you do not know may done to-night. I think I see right sort sympathy poor devils got at.” “And you will stop Sacrament next time, will not you?” said Tom. “Can I, I am confirmed?” “Go ask Doctor.” “I will.” That night, prayers, East followed Doctor, old verger bearing candle, upstairs. Tom watched, saw Doctor turn round he heard footsteps following closer usual, say, “Hah, East! Do want speak me, man?” “If please, sir.” And private door closed, Tom went his study state great trouble mind. It almost hour East came back. Then he rushed breathless. “Well, it is right,” he shouted, seizing Tom hand. “I feel ton weight mind.” “Hurrah,” said Tom. “I knew would be; tell us it.” “Well, I told it. You cannot think kind gentle he was, great grim man, I have feared anybody earth. When I stuck, he lifted I would little child. And he seemed know I would felt, gone all. And I burst crying--more I have done five years; he sat me, stroked head; I went blundering on, told all--much worse things I have told you. And he was not shocked bit, did not snub me, tell I fool, nothing pride wickedness, though I dare say was. And he did not tell follow thoughts, he did not give cut-and-dried explanation. But I would done he talked bit. I hardly remember he said yet; seemed spread round like healing, strength, light, bear up, plant rock, I could hold footing fight myself. I do not know do, I feel happy. And it is owing you, dear old boy!” And he seized Tom's hand again. “And you are come Communion?” said Tom. “Yes, confirmed holidays.” Tom's delight great his friend's. But he had not yet his talk, bent improving occasion: he proceeded propound Arthur's theory sorry his friends' deaths, he hitherto kept background, he much exercised; he did not feel honest take pleased him, throw rest, trying vigorously persuade he like his best friends die off-hand. But East's powers remaining serious exhausted, five minutes he saying ridiculous things he could think of, till Tom almost getting angry again. Despite himself, however, he could not help laughing giving up, East appealed with, “Well, Tom, are not going punch head, I hope, I insist upon sorry got earth?” And talk finished time, tried learn first lesson, poor success, appeared next morning, called narrowly escaped floored, ill-luck, however, sit heavily either souls. CHAPTER VIII--TOM BROWN'S LAST MATCH. “Heaven grant manlier heart, timely ere Youth fly, life's real tempest would coping; The fruit dreamy hoping Is, waking, blank despair.”--CLOUGH, Ambarvalia. The curtain rises upon last act little drama, hard-hearted publishers warn single volume must necessity end. Well, well! pleasantest things must come end. I little thought last long vacation, I began pages help away spare time watering-place, vividly many old scene lain hid away years dusty old corner brain, would come back again, stand clear bright happened yesterday. The book grateful task me, I hope you, dear young friends, read (friends assuredly must be, get far this), half sorry come last stage I am. Not solemn sad side it. As old scenes became living, actors became living too, many grave Crimea distant India, well quiet churchyards dear old country, seemed open send forth dead, voices looks ways one's ears eyes, old School-days. But sad. How be, believe Lord taught us? How be, one turn wheel, shall sides again, learning again, perhaps, new boys. Then others old faces dear us somehow another gone clean sight. Are dead living? We know not, thought brings sadness it. Wherever are, well believe God's work getting His wages. But some, still see sometimes streets, whose haunts homes know, could probably find almost day week set it, yet really farther dead, gone ken? Yes, must such; therein lies sadness old School memories. Yet old comrades, time space separate us, whose sides feel sure shall stand time shall more. We may think one another dangerous fanatics narrow bigots, truce possible, shall sever end lives, would respective duties imprison hang, power. We must go way, theirs, long flesh spirit hold together; let Rugby poet speak words healing trial:-- “To veer vain! on, onward strain, Brave barks, light, darkness too; Through winds tides one compass guides,-- To that, selves, true. “But, O blithe breeze, O great seas, Though never earliest parting past, On wide plain join again; Together lead home last. “One port, methought, alike sought, One purpose hold where'er fare. O bounding breeze, O rushing seas, At last, last, unite there!” * * Clough, Ambarvalia. This mere longing; prophecy. So too, old friends, friends more, sorrow men without hope. It seem us lost compass purpose, driven helplessly rocks quicksands, whose lives spent service world, flesh, devil, self alone, fellow-men, country, God, must mourn pray without sure hope without light, trusting He, whose hands well are, died well us, sees His creatures “With larger eyes ours, To make allowance us all,” will, His way His time, lead also home. Another two years passed, end summer half-year Rugby; fact, School broken up. The fifth-form examinations last week, upon followed speeches, sixth-form examinations exhibitions; now. The boys gone winds heaven, except town boys eleven, enthusiasts besides asked leave stay houses see result cricket matches. For year Wellesburn return match Marylebone match played Rugby, great delight town neighbourhood, sorrow aspiring young cricketers reckoning last three months showing Lord's ground. The Doctor started Lakes yesterday morning, interview captain eleven, presence Thomas, he arranged school cricket dinners be, matters necessary satisfactory carrying festivities, warned keeping spirituous liquors close, gates closed nine of the clock. The Wellesburn match played great success yesterday, School winning three wickets; to-day great event cricketing year, Marylebone match, played. What match been! The London eleven came afternoon train yesterday, time see end Wellesburn match; soon over, leading men umpire inspected ground, criticising rather unmercifully. The captain School eleven, one two others, played Lord's match before, knew old Mr. Aislabie several Lord's men, accompanied them; rest eleven looked Three Trees admiring eyes, asked one another names illustrious strangers, recounted many runs made late matches Bell's Life. They looked hard-bitten, wiry, whiskered fellows young adversaries felt rather desponding result morrow's match. The ground last chosen, two men set work upon water roll; then, yet half-hour daylight, one suggested dance turf. The close half full citizens families, idea hailed enthusiasm. The cornopean player still ground. In five minutes eleven half dozen Wellesburn Marylebone men got partners somehow another, merry country-dance going on, every one flocked, new couples joined every minute, till hundred going middle again; long line school buildings looked gravely them, every window glowing last rays western sun; rooks clanged tops old elms, greatly excited, resolved country-dance too; great flag flapped lazily gentle western breeze. Altogether sight would made glad heart brave old founder, Lawrence Sheriff, he half good fellow I take been. It cheerful sight see. But made valuable sight captain School eleven he saw his young hands shaking shyness awe Lord's men, crossed hands capered grass together; strangers entered all, threw away cigars, danced shouted like boys; old Mr. Aislabie stood looking his white hat, leaning bat, benevolent enjoyment. “This hop worth thirty runs us to-morrow, making Raggles Johnson,” thinks young leader, he revolves many things his mind, standing side Mr. Aislabie, he leave minute, he feels character School courtesy resting his shoulders. But quarter nine struck, he saw old Thomas beginning fidget keys his hand, he thought Doctor's parting monition, stopped cornopean once, notwithstanding loud-voiced remonstrances sides; crowd scattered away close, eleven going School-house, supper beds provided Doctor's orders. Deep consultations supper order going in, bowl first over, whether would best play steady freely; youngest hands declared should not bit nervous, praised opponents jolliest fellows world, except perhaps old friends Wellesburn men. How far little good-nature elders go right sort boys! The morning dawned bright warm, intense relief many anxious youngster, betimes mark signs weather. The eleven went body breakfast, plunge cold bath corner close. The ground splendid order, soon ten of the clock, spectators arrived, ready, two Lord's men took places wickets--the School, usual liberality young hands, put adversaries first. Old Bailey stepped wicket, called play, match begun. “Oh, well bowled! well bowled, Johnson!” cries captain, catching ball sending high rook trees, third Marylebone man walks away wicket, old Bailey gravely sets middle stump puts bails on. “How many runs?” Away scamper three boys scoring table, back minute amongst rest eleven, collected together knot wicket. “Only eighteen runs, three wickets down!” “Huzza old Rugby!” sings Jack Raggles, long-stop, toughest burliest boys, commonly called “Swiper Jack,” forthwith stands his head, brandishes his legs air triumph, till next boy catches hold his heels, throws his back. “Steady there; do not ass, Jack,” says captain; “we have not got best wicket yet. Ah, look cover-point,” adds he, he sees long-armed bare-headed, slashing-looking player coming wicket. “And, Jack, mind hits. He steals runs man England.” And find got work now. The newcomer's off-hitting tremendous, his running like flash lightning. He never his ground except his wicket down. Nothing whole game trying boys. He stolen three byes first ten minutes, Jack Raggles furious, begins throwing savagely farther wicket, he sternly stopped captain. It young gentlemen keep his team steady, he knows everything depends it, faces his work bravely. The score creeps fifty; boys begin look blank; spectators, mustering strong, silent. The ball flies his bat parts field, he gives rest catches one. But cricket full glorious chances, goddess presides loves bring skilful players. Johnson, young bowler, getting wild, bowls ball almost wide off; batter steps cuts beautifully cover-point standing deep--in fact almost ground. The ball comes skimming twisting along three feet ground; he rushes it, sticks somehow fingers his left hand, utter astonishment whole field. Such catch has not made close years, cheering maddening. “Pretty cricket,” says captain, throwing ground deserted wicket long breath. He feels crisis passed. I wish I space describe match--how captain stumped next man leg-shooter, bowled small cobs old Mr. Aislabie, came last wicket; Lord's men half-past twelve of the clock ninety-eight runs; captain School eleven went first give his men pluck, scored twenty-five beautiful style; Rugby four behind first innings; glorious dinner fourth-form school; cover-point hitter sang topping comic songs, old Mr. Aislabie made best speeches ever heard, afterwards. But I have not space--that is fact; must fancy all, carry half-past seven of the clock, School in, five wickets down, thirty-two runs make win. The Marylebone men played carelessly second innings, working like horses save match. There much healthy, hearty, happy life scattered close; group I beg call especial attention there, slope island, looks towards cricket-ground. It consists three figures; two seated bench, one ground feet. The first, tall, slight rather gaunt man, bushy eyebrow dry, humorous smile, evidently clergyman. He carelessly dressed, looks rather used up, is not much wondered at, seeing he finished six weeks examination work; he basks, spreads evening sun, bent enjoying life, though he does not quite know his arms legs. Surely friend young master, glimpses before, his face gained great deal since last came across him. And his side, white flannel shirt trousers, straw hat, captain's belt, untanned yellow cricket shoes eleven wear, sits strapping figure, near six feet high, ruddy, tanned face whiskers, curly brown hair, laughing, dancing eye. He leaning forward his elbows resting his knees, dandling his favourite bat, he made thirty forty runs to-day, his strong brown hands. It Tom Brown, grown young man nineteen years old, praepostor captain eleven, spending his last day Rugby boy, and, let us hope, much wiser he bigger, since last pleasure coming across him. And feet warm, dry ground, similarly dressed, sits Arthur, Turkish fashion, his bat across his knees. He longer boy--less boy, fact, Tom, one may judge thoughtfulness his face, somewhat paler, too, one could wish; his figure, though slight, well knit active, his old timidity disappeared, replaced silent, quaint fun, his face twinkles over, he listens broken talk two, he joins every then. All three watching game eagerly, joining cheering follows every good hit. It pleasing see easy, friendly footing pupils master, perfectly respectful, yet reserve nothing forced intercourse. Tom clearly abandoned old theory “natural enemies” case rate. But time listen saying, see gather it. “I do not object theory,” says master, “and I allow made fair case yourself. But now, books Aristophanes, instance, you have reading play half Doctor, have not you?” “Yes, Knights,” answered Tom. “Well, I am sure would enjoyed wonderful humour twice much taken pains scholarship.” “Well, sir, I do not believe boy form enjoyed sets-to Cleon Sausage-seller I did--eh, Arthur?” said Tom, giving stir his foot. “Yes, I must say he did,” said Arthur. “I think, sir, you have hit upon wrong book there.” “Not bit it,” said master. “Why, passages arms, thoroughly appreciate unless master weapons? weapons language, you, Brown, never half worked at; so, I say, must lost delicate shades meaning make best part fun.” “Oh, well played! bravo, Johnson!” shouted Arthur, dropping his bat clapping furiously, Tom joined “Bravo, Johnson!” might heard chapel. “Eh! it? I did not see,” inquired master. “They got one run, I thought?” “No, ball, three-quarters length, coming straight his leg bail. Nothing turn wrist could saved him, he drew away leg safe one.--Bravo, Johnson!” “How well bowling, though,” said Arthur; “they do not mean beat, I see.” “There now,” struck master; “you see that is I preaching half-hour. The delicate play true thing. I do not understand cricket, I do not enjoy fine draws tell best play, though Raggles hit ball hard away six I delighted one. Do not see analogy?” “Yes, sir,” answered Tom, looking roguishly, “I see; question remains whether I got good understanding Greek particles cricket thoroughly. I am thick, I never time both.” “I see incorrigible,” said master, chuckle; “but I refute example. Arthur taken Greek cricket too.” “Yes, thanks him; Greek came natural him. Why, he first came I remember he used read Herodotus pleasure I Don Quixote, could not made false concord he would tried ever hard; I looked his cricket.” “Out! Bailey given out. Do see, Tom?” cries Arthur. “How foolish run hard.” “Well, cannot helped; he played well. Whose turn go in?” “I do not know; they have got list tent.” “Let us go see,” said Tom, rising; moment Jack Raggles two three came running island moat. “O Brown, may not I go next?” shouts Swiper. “Whose name next list?” says captain. “Winter's, Arthur's,” answers boy carries it; “but twenty-six runs get, time lose. I heard Mr. Aislabie say stumps must drawn quarter past eight exactly.” “Oh, let Swiper go in,” chorus boys; Tom yields his better judgment. “I dare say I have lost match nonsense,” he says, he sits again; “they will sure get Jack's wicket three four minutes; however, you will chance, sir, seeing hard hit two,” adds he, smiling, turning master. “Come, none irony, Brown,” answers master. “I am beginning understand game scientifically. What noble game is, too!” “Is not it? But it is game. It is institution,” said Tom. “Yes,” said Arthur--“the birthright British boys old young, habeas corpus trial jury British men.” “The discipline reliance one another teaches valuable, I think,” went master, “it ought unselfish game. It merges individual eleven; he does not play he may win, his side may.” “That is true,” said Tom, “and that is football cricket, one comes think it, much better games fives hare-and-hounds, others object come first win oneself, one's side may win.” “And captain eleven!” said master; “what post his School-world! almost hard Doctor's--requiring skill gentleness firmness, I know rare qualities.” “Which do not he may wish he may get!” said Tom, laughing; “at rate he has not got yet, he would not flat to-night let Jack Raggles go his turn.” “Ah, Doctor never would done that,” said Arthur demurely. “Tom, you have great deal learn yet art ruling.” “Well, I wish you would tell Doctor then, get let stop till I am twenty. I do not want leave, I am sure.” “What sight is,” broke master, “the Doctor ruler! Perhaps little corner British Empire thoroughly, wisely, strongly ruled now. I am thankful every day life I came him.” “So I, I am sure,” said Tom, “and sorry I have got leave.” “Every place thing one sees reminds one wise act his,” went master. “This island now--you remember time, Brown, laid small gardens, cultivated frost-bitten fags February March?” “Of course I do,” said Tom; “did not I hate spending two hours afternoon grubbing tough dirt stump fives bat? But turf-cart good fun enough.” “I dare say was, always leading fights townspeople; stealing flowers gardens Rugby Easter show abominable.” “Well, was,” said Tom, looking down, “but fags could not help ourselves. But Doctor's ruling?” “A great deal, I think,” said master; “what brought island-fagging end?” “Why, Easter speeches put till midsummer,” said Tom, “and sixth gymnastic poles put here.” “Well, changed time speeches, put idea gymnastic poles heads worships sixth form?” said master. “The Doctor, I suppose,” said Tom. “I never thought that.” “Of course did not,” said master, “or else, fag were, would shouted whole school putting old customs. And that is way Doctor's reforms carried he left himself--quietly naturally, putting good thing place bad, letting bad die out; wavering, hurry--the best thing could done time being, patience rest.” “Just Tom's way,” chimed Arthur, nudging Tom his elbow--“driving nail go;” allusion Tom answered sly kick. “Exactly so,” said master, innocent allusion by-play. Meantime Jack Raggles, his sleeves tucked his great brown elbows, scorning pads gloves, presented wicket; run one forward drive Johnson's, receive his first ball. There twenty-four runs make, four wickets go down--a winning match play decently steady. The ball swift one, rises fast, catching Jack outside thigh, bounding away india-rubber, run two leg-bye amidst great applause shouts Jack's many admirers. The next ball beautifully-pitched ball outer stump, reckless unfeeling Jack catches hold of, hits right round leg five, applause becomes deafening. Only seventeen runs get four wickets! The game ours! It now, Jack walks swaggering his wicket, his bat his shoulder, Mr. Aislabie holds short parley his men. Then cover-point hitter, cunning man, goes bowl slow twisters. Jack waves his hand triumphantly towards tent, much say, “See I do not finish three hits.” Alas, son Jack, enemy old thee. The first ball Jack steps meets, swiping his force. If he allowed twist! But he has not, ball goes spinning straight air, would never come again. Away runs Jack, shouting trusting chapter accidents; bowler runs steadily it, judging every spin, calling out, “I it,” catches it, playfully pitches back stalwart Jack, departing rueful countenance. “I knew would be,” says Tom, rising. “Come along; game's getting serious.” So leave island go tent; deep consultation, Arthur sent in, goes wicket last exhortation Tom play steady keep his bat straight. To suggestions Winter best bat left, Tom replies, “Arthur steadiest, Johnson make runs wicket kept up.” “I surprised see Arthur eleven,” said master, stood together front dense crowd, closing round ground. “Well, I am quite sure he ought his play,” said Tom, “but I could not help putting in. It much good, cannot think I owe him.” The master smiled. The clock strikes eight, whole field becomes fevered excitement. Arthur, two narrow escapes, scores one, Johnson gets ball. The bowling fielding superb, Johnson's batting worthy occasion. He makes two, one, managing keep ball himself, Arthur backs runs perfectly. Only eleven runs make now, crowd scarcely breathe. At last Arthur gets ball again, actually drives forward two, feels prouder he got three best prizes, hearing Tom's shout joy, “Well played, well played, young un!” But next ball much young hand, his bails fly different ways. Nine runs make, two wickets go down: much human nerves. Before Winter get in, omnibus take Lord's men train pulls side close, Mr. Aislabie Tom consult, give stumps drawn next over. And ends great match. Winter Johnson carry bats, and, one day's match, Lord's men declared winners, scored first innings. But defeat victory: think Tom School eleven, accompany conquerors omnibus, send three ringing cheers, Mr. Aislabie shaken hands round, saying Tom, “I must compliment you, sir, eleven, I hope shall member come town.” As Tom rest eleven turning back close, everybody beginning cry another country-dance, encouraged success night before, young master, leaving close, stopped him, asked come tea half-past eight, adding, “I will not keep half hour, ask Arthur come too.” “I will come directly, you will let me,” said Tom, “for I feel rather melancholy, quite country-dance supper rest.” “Do, means,” said master; “I will wait you.” So Tom went get his boots things tent, tell Arthur invitation, speak his second command stopping dancing shutting close soon grew dusk. Arthur promised follow soon he dance. So Tom handed his things man charge tent, walked quietly away gate master waiting, two took way together Hillmorton road. Of course found master's house locked up, servants away close--about time, doubt, footing away grass, extreme delight themselves, utter oblivion unfortunate bachelor master, whose one enjoyment shape meals his “dish tea” (as grandmothers called it) evening; phrase apt his case, he always poured his saucer drinking. Great good man's horror finding shut his house. Had he alone he would treated matter course, would strolled contentedly his gravel walk one came home; he hurt stain his character host, especially guest pupil. However, guest seemed think great joke, presently, poked round house, mounted wall, he could reach passage window. The window, turned out, bolted, another minute Tom house front door, he opened inside. The master chuckled grimly burglarious entry, insisted leaving hall-door two front windows open, frighten truants return; two set foraging tea, operation master much fault, faintest possible idea find anything, being, moreover, wondrously short-sighted; Tom, sort instinct, knew right cupboards kitchen pantry, soon managed place snuggery table better materials meal appeared probably reign his tutor, initiated, amongst things, excellence mysterious condiment, dripping-cake. The cake newly baked, rich flaky; Tom found reposing cook's private cupboard, awaiting her return; warning her finished last crumb. The kettle sang away merrily hob snuggery, for, notwithstanding time year, lighted fire, throwing windows wide open time; heaps books papers pushed away end table, great solitary engraving King's College Chapel mantelpiece looked less stiff usual, settled twilight serious drinking tea. After talk match, indifferent subjects, conversation came naturally back Tom's approaching departure, he began make his moan. “Well, shall miss quite much miss us,” said master. “You Nestor School now, not?” “Yes, ever since East left,” answered Tom. “By-the-bye, heard him?” “Yes, I letter February, he started India join his regiment.” “He make capital officer.” “Ay, will not he!” said Tom, brightening. “No fellow could handle boys better, I suppose soldiers like boys. And he will never tell go he will not go himself. No mistake that. A braver fellow never walked.” “His year sixth taught good deal useful now.” “So will,”' said Tom, staring fire. “Poor dear Harry,” he went on--“how well I remember day put twenty! How he rose situation, burnt his cigar-cases, gave away his pistols, pondered constitutional authority sixth, his new duties Doctor, fifth form, fags! Ay, fellow ever acted better, though he always people's man--for fags, constituted authorities. He could not help that, know. I am sure Doctor must liked him?” said Tom, looking inquiringly. “The Doctor sees good every one, appreciates it,” said master dogmatically; “but I hope East get good colonel. He will not he cannot respect him. How long took him, even here, learn lesson obeying!” “Well, I wish I alongside him,” said Tom. “If I cannot Rugby, I want work world, dawdling away three years Oxford.” “What mean 'at work world'?” said master, pausing his lips close his saucerful tea, peering Tom it. “Well, I mean real work--one's profession--whatever one really make one's living by. I want real good, feeling I play world,” answered Tom, rather puzzled find he really mean. “You mixing two different things head, I think, Brown,” said master, putting empty saucer, “and ought get clear them. You talk 'working get living,' 'doing real good world,' breath. Now, may getting good living profession, yet good world, quite contrary, time. Keep latter one object, right, whether make living not; dwell other, you will likely drop mere money-making, let world take care good evil. Do not hurry finding work world yourself--you old enough judge yet; look place find in, try make things little better honester there. You will find plenty keep hand Oxford, wherever else go. And do not led away think part world important unimportant. Every corner world important. No man knows whether part so, every man may honest work his corner.” And good man went talk wisely Tom sort work he might take undergraduate, warned prevalent university sins, explained many great differences university school life, till twilight changed darkness, heard truant servants stealing back entrance. “I wonder Arthur be,” said Tom last, looking his watch; “why, it is nearly half-past nine already.” “Oh, he comfortably supper eleven, forgetful his oldest friends,” said master. “Nothing given greater pleasure,” he went on, “than friendship him; making both.” “Of me, rate,” answered Tom; “I never him. It luckiest chance world sent Rugby made chum.” “Why talk lucky chances?” said master. “I do not know things world; rate, neither luck chance matter.” Tom looked inquiringly, he went on. “Do remember Doctor lectured East end one half-year, she will, getting sorts scrapes?” “Yes, well enough,” said Tom; “it half-year Arthur came.” “Exactly so,” answered master. “Now, I minutes afterwards, he great distress two. And talk, agreed particular wanted object School beyond games mischief; quite clear never would make regular school work first object. And Doctor, beginning next half-year, looked best new boys, separated East, put young boy study, hope somebody lean you, would begin stand little steadier yourself, get manliness thoughtfulness. And I assure he watched experiment ever since great satisfaction. Ah! one boys ever know anxiety given him, care he watched every step school lives.” Up time Tom never given wholly understood Doctor. At first he thoroughly feared him. For years, I tried show, he learnt regard love respect, think great wise good man. But regarded his position School, he little proud, Tom idea giving one credit himself, and, truth tell, self-conceited young gentleman subject. He will not boast he fought his way fairly School, never made taken big fellow master, quite different place he first came. And, indeed, though he did not actually boast it, yet his secret soul he great extent believe great reform School owing quite much one else. Arthur, he acknowledged, done good, taught good deal; boys different ways, means influence School general. And Doctor, why, he splendid master; every one knew masters could little school hours. In short, he felt terms equality his chief, far social state School concerned, thought Doctor would find easy matter get without him. Moreover, his School Toryism still strong, he looked still jealousy Doctor, somewhat fanatic matter change, thought desirable School he wise person (such himself) look sharply vested School-rights, see nothing done injury republic without due protest. It new light find that, besides teaching sixth, governing guiding whole School, editing classics, writing histories, great headmaster found time busy years watch career even him, Tom Brown, his particular friends, and, doubt, fifty boys time, without taking least credit himself, seeming know, let one else know, he ever thought particularly boy all. However, Doctor's victory complete moment Tom Brown rate. He gave way points, enemy marched right him--cavalry, infantry, artillery, land transport corps, camp followers. It taken eight long years it; done thoroughly, was not corner left did not believe Doctor. Had he returned School again, Doctor begun half-year abolishing fagging, football, Saturday half-holiday, cherished School institutions, Tom would supported blindest faith. And so, half confession his previous shortcomings, sorrowful adieus his tutor, he received two beautifully-bound volumes Doctor's sermons, parting present, he marched Schoolhouse, hero-worshipper, would satisfied soul Thomas Carlyle himself. There he found eleven high jinks supper, Jack Raggles shouting comic songs performing feats strength, greeted chorus mingled remonstrance his desertion joy his reappearance. And falling humour evening, he soon great boy rest; ten of the clock chaired round quadrangle, one hall benches, borne aloft eleven, shouting chorus, “For he is jolly good fellow,” old Thomas, melting mood, School-house servants, stood looking on. And next morning breakfast he squared cricketing accounts, went round his tradesmen acquaintance, said his hearty good-byes; twelve of the clock train, away London, longer school-boy, divided his thoughts hero-worship, honest regrets long stage his life slipping sight behind him, hopes resolves next stage upon he entering confidence young traveller. CHAPTER IX--FINIS. “Strange friend, past, present, be; Loved deeplier, darklier understood; Behold I dream dream good, And mingle world thee.”--TENNYSON. In summer 1842, hero stopped well-known station; leaving his bag fishing-rod porter, walked slowly sadly towards town. It July. He rushed away Oxford moment term over, fishing ramble Scotland two college friends, three weeks living oatcake, mutton-hams, whisky, wildest parts Skye. They descended one sultry evening little inn Kyle Rhea ferry; Tom another party put tackle together began exploring stream sea-trout supper, third strolled house arrange entertainment. Presently he came loose blouse slippers, short pipe his mouth, old newspaper his hand, threw heathery scrub met shingle, within easy hail fishermen. There he lay, picture free-and-easy, loafing, hand-to-mouth young England, “improving his mind,” he shouted them, perusal fortnight-old weekly paper, soiled marks toddy-glasses tobacco-ashes, legacy last traveller, he hunted kitchen little hostelry, and, youth communicative turn mind, began imparting contents fishermen he went on. “What bother making wretched corn-laws! Here is three four columns full nothing sliding scales fixed duties. Hang tobacco, it is always going out! Ah, here is something better--a splendid match Kent England, Brown, Kent winning three wickets. Felix fifty-six runs without chance, out!” Tom, intent fish risen twice, answered grunt. “Anything Goodwood?” called third man. “Rory O'More drawn. Butterfly colt amiss,” shouted student. “Just luck,” grumbled inquirer, jerking his flies water, throwing heavy, sullen splash, frightening Tom's fish. “I say, cannot throw lighter there? We are not fishing grampuses,” shouted Tom across stream. “Hullo, Brown! here is something you,” called reading man next moment. “Why, old master, Arnold Rugby, dead.” Tom's hand stopped half-way his cast, his line flies went tangling round round his rod; might knocked feather. Neither his companions took notice him, luckily; violent effort he set work mechanically disentangle his line. He felt completely carried his moral intellectual legs, he lost his standing-point invisible world. Besides which, deep, loving loyalty he felt his old leader made shock intensely painful. It first great wrench his life, first gap angel Death made his circle, he felt numbed, beaten down, spiritless. Well, well! I believe good many others like case, learn loss soul man cannot stand lean upon human prop, however strong, wise, good; He upon alone stand lean knock away props His wise merciful way, ground stay left Himself, Rock Ages, upon alone sure foundation every soul man laid. As he wearily laboured his line, thought struck him, “It may false--a mere newspaper lie.” And he strode recumbent smoker. “Let look paper,” said he. “Nothing else it,” answered other, handing listlessly. “Hullo, Brown! what is matter, old fellow? Are not well?” “Where it?” said Tom, turning leaves, his hands trembling, his eyes swimming, he could read. “What? What looking for?” said his friend, jumping looking his shoulder. “That--about Arnold,” said Tom. “Oh, here,” said other, putting his finger paragraph. Tom read again. There could mistake identity, though account short enough. “Thank you,” said he last, dropping paper. “I shall go walk. Do not Herbert wait supper me.” And away he strode, moor back house, alone, master his grief possible. His friend looked him, sympathizing wondering, and, knocking ashes his pipe, walked Herbert. After short parley walked together house. “I am afraid confounded newspaper spoiled Brown's fun trip.” “How odd he fond his old master,” said Herbert. Yet also public-school men. The two, however, notwithstanding Tom's prohibition, waited supper him, everything ready he came back half hour afterwards. But he could join cheerful talk, party soon silent, notwithstanding efforts three. One thing Tom resolved, was, he could not stay Scotland longer: he felt irresistible longing get Rugby, home, soon broke others, much tact oppose. So daylight next morning he marching Ross-shire, evening hit Caledonian Canal, took next steamer, travelled fast boat railway could carry Rugby station. As he walked town, he felt shy afraid seen, took back streets--why, he did not know, he followed his instinct. At School-gates he made dead pause; soul quadrangle--all lonely, silent, sad. So another effort he strode quadrangle, School-house offices. He found little matron her room deep mourning; shook her hand, tried talk, moved nervously about. She evidently thinking subject he, he could not begin talking. “Where shall I find Thomas?” said he last, getting desperate. “In servants' hall, I think, sir. But will not take anything?” said matron, looking rather disappointed. “No, thank you,” said he, strode find old verger, sitting his little den, old, puzzling hieroglyphics. He looked his spectacles Tom seized his hand wrung it. “Ah! you have heard it, sir, I see,” said he. Tom nodded, sat shoe-board, old man told his tale, wiped his spectacles, fairly flowed quaint, homely, honest sorrow. By time he done Tom felt much better. “Where he buried, Thomas?” said he last. “Under altar chapel, sir,” answered Thomas. “You would like key, I dare say?” “Thank you, Thomas--yes, I should, much.” And old man fumbled among his bunch, got up, though he would go him; steps stopped short, said, “Perhaps you would like go yourself, sir?” Tom nodded, bunch keys handed him, injunction sure lock door him, bring back eight of the clock. He walked quickly quadrangle close. The longing upon driven thus far, like gad-fly Greek legends, giving rest mind body, seemed sudden satisfied, shrivel pall. “Why I go on? It is use,” he thought, threw full length turf, looked vaguely listlessly well-known objects. There town boys playing cricket, wicket pitched best piece middle big-side ground--a sin equal sacrilege eyes captain eleven. He nearly getting go send off. “Pshaw! will not remember me. They have right I,” he muttered. And thought his sceptre departed, his mark wearing out, came home first time, bitterly enough. He lying spot fights came off--where he fought six years ago his first last battle. He conjured scene till he could almost hear shouts ring, East's whisper his ear; looking across close Doctor's private door, half expected see open, tall figure cap gown come striding elm-trees towards him. No, no; sight could never seen again. There flag flying round tower; School-house windows shuttered up; flag went again, shutters came down, would welcome stranger. All left earth he honoured lying cold still chapel floor. He would go see place more, leave all. New men new methods might people; let would, worship rising star; he, least, would faithful sun set. And he got up, walked chapel door, unlocked it, fancying mourner broad land, feeding his selfish sorrow. He passed vestibule, paused moment glance empty benches. His heart still proud high, he walked seat he last occupied sixth-form boy, sat collect his thoughts. And, truth tell, needed collecting setting order little. The memories eight years dancing his brain, carrying whither would; while, beneath all, his heart throbbing dull sense loss could never made him. The rays evening sun came solemnly painted windows his head, fell gorgeous colours opposite wall, perfect stillness soothed his spirit little little. And he turned pulpit, looked it, then, leaning forward his head his hands, groaned aloud. If he could seen Doctor one five minutes--have told his heart, he owed him, he loved reverenced him, would, God's help, follow his steps life death--he could borne without murmur. But he gone away ever without knowing all, much bear. “But I sure he know all?” The thought made start. “May he even near me, chapel? If he be, I sorrowing he would sorrow, I wish sorrowed I shall meet again?” He raised looked round, minute rose walked humbly lowest bench, sat seat he occupied his first Sunday Rugby. And old memories rushed back again, softened subdued, soothing he let carried away them. And he looked great painted window altar, remembered how, little boy, he used try look elm-trees rooks, painted glass came; subscription painted glass, letter he wrote home money give it. And there, below, name boy sat his right hand first day, scratched rudely oak panelling. And came thought his old schoolfellows; form form boys nobler, braver, purer he rose seemed rebuke him. Could he think them, felt feeling--they honoured loved first man he taken years know love? Could he think yet dearer gone, bore his name shared his blood, without husband father? Then grief he began share others became gentle holy, he rose more, walked steps altar, tears flowed freely his cheeks, knelt humbly hopefully, lay his share burden proved heavy bear his strength. Here let us leave him. Where better could leave altar he first caught glimpse glory his birthright, felt drawing bond links living souls together one brotherhood--at grave beneath altar opened his eyes see glory, softened his heart till could feel bond? And let us hard him, moment his soul fuller tomb lies altar Him speaks. Such stages gone through, I believe, young brave souls, must win way hero-worship worship Him King Lord heroes. For mysterious human relationships--through love tenderness purity mothers sisters wives, strength courage wisdom fathers brothers teachers--that come knowledge Him alone love, tenderness, purity, strength, courage, wisdom dwell ever ever perfect fullness.
