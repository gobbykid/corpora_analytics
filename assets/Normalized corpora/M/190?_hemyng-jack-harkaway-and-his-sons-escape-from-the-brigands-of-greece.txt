 JACK HARKAWAY AND HIS SON'S ESCAPE FROM THE BRIGANDS OF GREECE. BEING THE CONTINUATION OF "JACK HARKAWAY AND HIS SON'S ADVENTURES IN GREECE." CHAPTER I. THE CONTESSA'S LETTER TO MR. MOLE--ON PLEASURE BENT--THE MENDICANT FRIAR--MIDNIGHT MARAUDERS--HOUSE BREAKING. When Mrs. Harkaway's maid returned villa, she got scolded long upon errand importance she entrusted. Thereupon, she prepared twenty excuses, thing truth. The words warning brigand called her without due effect. "She detained," she said, "by Contessa Maraviglia letter she brought back Mr. Mole." The letter invitation grand ball given contessa Palazzo Maraviglia, Harkaways going. Dick Harvey work business, made contessa believe indirectly Mr. Mole graceful dancer, would eternal shame _bal masqué_ take place neighbourhood without graced his--Mole's--presence. The result lunch Mr. Mole received maid following singular effusion. "Al Illustrissimo Signor Mole," which, translated, means, "To illustrious Mr. Mole." "Hullo!" said tutor, looking around dropping his eye Dick, "who from?" "From Contessa Maraviglia," replied girl. Mr. Mole gave her piercing glance. The contessa's letter sort puzzle poor old Mole. "The Contessa Maraviglia begs honour Signor Mole's company 16th instant. She accept refusal, _fête_ especially organised honour Signor Mole, whose rare excellence poetry motion elevated dancing art." Isaac Mole read re-read singular letter, he grew fogged. He thought contessa failed express herself clearly English account her imperfect knowledge language; he soon corrected impression. The lady question, transpired, English. So poor Mole he thought best circumstances, consult Dick Harvey. "Dear me!" echoed Dick, innocently; "why, made impression here, Mr. Mole." "Do think so?" said Mole, doubtfully. "Beyond question. This contessa smitten, sir, attractions; I assist here." "You can?" "Of course." "Thank you, dear Harvey, thank you," replied Mr. Mole eagerly. "Yes; I let contessa know hope her." Isaac Mole's vanity tickled this. "Do not think would cruel undeceive her?" "Cruel, sir!" said Dick, severe air, "no, sir; I do not. It duty tell her all." Mr. Mole looked alarmed. "What mean?" "That married man." "I say, I say--" "Yes, sir, much married," pursued Dick, relentlessly; "that three wives, nearly taking fourth." "Do not, Dick." "All less black." "Dick, Dick!" "However, help it; go ball." "Never." "You will, though. The contessa heard fame ball room--" "What!" "In bygone years, doubt--and she know little matters happened since spoil activity, grace." As he alluded "little matters," he glanced Mr. Mole's wooden legs. Mr. Mole thought over, he read letter again. "You right, Harvey," he said air determination; "and mind's made up." "Is it?" "Yes." "So much better, absence would sadly missed ball." "You misunderstand me, Harvey; I shall go." Dick looked frightened. "Do not say that, Mr. Mole, I beg, do not; would dangerous." "What earth mean?" "I mean lady English birth, she lived land Borgias, yet know use poison." "Harvey!" "And her love slighted, she might recollect it." Mr. Mole looked precious uncomfortable. "It really embarrassing, Harvey," said he; "my personal attractions likely get trouble." And yet, spite his embarrassment, Mr. Mole altogether displeased fancy. He strutted down, showing fall his back best advantage, evidently conscious he rather fine man. "Yes, sir," said Harvey, great gravity; "your fatal beauty likely lead mess." At words "fatal beauty," Mr. Mole made grimace. It rather strong dose even swallow. "Draw mild, Harvey," said he, "pray draw mild." Dick shook his head great seriousness. "Do not deceived, Mr. Mole," said he; "use greatest care, poor countess pitied. Her love likely turn violent hate she finds herself slighted--the poignard poisoned chalice may yet called play part career." Mr. Mole turned pale. Yet he tried laugh. A hollow ghastly laugh too, told he felt plainly words could done. "Do not, Harvey; do not, I beg!" he said faltering tones; "it sounds like dreadful thing one sees upon stage." "In southern countries know, Mr. Mole, man's life worth much." "Harvey!" "A hired assassin bravo cut throat stab man back francs." "Oh!" "I advise keep dark--and avoid dark corners. These people poison you, too, bouquet jewel. Accept flower nosegay, do not smell it." "Harvey." "Sir?" "Is wish make uncomfortable?" "How think it?" "Do wish dream night, disturb Mrs. Mole, get wink sleep?" "Certainly not; that is I giving advice; pray understand contessa thinks single man." "Good gracious me; unpleasant contessa love one." "I do not know that; men would not say so. There are, I will bound, forty men within mile house would give ears received letter." Mr. Mole smiled--a self-satisfied, complacent smile, "Do think so?" "I know it." Mole lifted his collar shot his cuffs his hands, he stomped across room, looked glass. "Well, well, Harvey, I suppose I must go ball; bear witness I go reasons prudence, I going led away little silly reasons vanity?" "Of course," returned Dick, gravely. "Besides, I go disguised." "Certainly" "And disguise would recommend?" "Why matter reflection," said Dick. "I think ought almost keep character." "The character!" said Mole. "What character?" "A Terpsichorean personage," replied Dick, air one discussing grave problem. "Say, instance, ballet girl." Mr. Mole gasped. "No, no; ballet girl." "A fairy queen, then." "Do not, Dick; do not, I beg." "Or, object costume gentler sex, say spangles wand harlequin?" "Do really think costume would become me?" "Do I think?" iterated Dick. "Do I _know!_ Of course would become you. You look part life: wants figure show dress shown it." "But my--my wooden legs, Dick?" "Oh, I will provide cork ones, are," said Harvey, producing pair. And settled. Mr. Mole go ball, his disguise well-known spangles colours harlequin. Harvey chose clown's costume carried his shoulder Mole's wooden legs, case thing happened cork ones he walking first time. Harkaway go knight old. Magog Brand selected character Quasimodo, hunchback Nôtre Dame. Jefferson selected character Julius Caesar, costume his fine, stalwart form set considerable advantage. Mrs. Harkaway go Diana, huntress, Mrs. Harvey made Marie Stuart her choice. Little Emily Paquita went dresses Charles Second period. These young ladies escorted young Jack Harry Girdwood, richly habited young Venetian nobles sixteenth century. As passed garden door man stood path. He wore long serge gown, cowl, like mendicant monk, approached he put his open hand alms. "Bother beggars!" said Mr. Mole, tartly. The monk shrank back his cowl, stood aside party went by. The garden door held maid servant passed on, hearing, she dropped small silver coin mendicant friar's hand. "There," she said, "I spare something, father, although rich English cannot not, heretics pagans!" The friar, seemingly aged man, muttered his thanks, girl retired closed door, locking behind her. No sooner door closed mendicant monk whistled low distinct note, lo! two men appeared upon scene. It looked though come trap-doors earth, suddenly show sight. "Captain Mathias," said disguised monk first came up, "I learnt wish know." "You have?" ejaculated, man addressed mendicant monk, other. "Out it, then." "Still impatience, Toro, can.--" "Bah!" "Well, then, learn Mole goes as--" "Bother Mole!" interrupted Toro, harshly. "How great foe go?" "Harkaway?" "Yes." "An English knight old." "It shall task," said Toro, "to keep his character, give realistic look hand-to-hand fight." "Do not rash," said mendicant friar, "or may chance beaten." "I risk life it." "You have--you do; every hour live imperils it. Did see party go?" "I did," said Mathias. The latter captain brigands. Already upon footing equality, two adventurers opportunities, failed seize. They courage, ready wit, presence mind, boldness daring, cunning, fell made acquaintance brigand's gang unpleasant auspices, became two principal members within days. But resume. "Tell me, Hunston," said Toro, "does Jefferson go ball?" "Yes." "How disguised?" "Julius Caesar." The Italian said nothing, his lips moved, his lowering brow expressive words could his old comrade. It boded ill Jefferson. They met fair fight, he, Toro, defeated. That defeat bitter gall him. He would avenged. And he could cope doughty Anglo-American, let look it. What strength skill failed achieve, assassin's knife would accomplish. "Did see girl attended gate?" demanded mendicant friar, Hunston, would better call him, since need concealment. "I did." "And recognised her, Mathias?" he asked brigand captain. "Yes; pretty girl stopped her lover, coy Marietta." "Now well off, may well set work," said Hunston. "Good." Hunston threw back his friar's cowl produced key. "They many good hunt this," he said, his old sinister laugh. "I dare say." "It lucky thing dainty little Marietta dropped it." "Yes, makes matters much easier us begin with." The door yielded touch sham mendicant friar, three worthies entered grounds. Silently stepped across grassplot, keeping thick shrubbery house far could, gained shelter trellissed verandah, dog within set alarming noise. The three robbers exchanged uneasy glances. "Curse beast!" muttered Mathias captain; "he ruin us." Toro got ready his long hunting-knife looked about. But dog sight. A lucky thing old friend little Mike, touch ugly instrument would soon stopped his singing. Now, verandah half-opened window, Mathias peered anxiously. No signs Mike. A voice heard calling faithful guardian house silent, Mike refused emphatically comforted; thereupon, person imprudently called dog her tied up. This quiet him. So person question tripped garden see really reason dog's singular behaviour. In passing path she went close verandah, skirts her dress actually brushed aside creeping plants garnished trellis work. "Snarling, barking little beast!" quoth Marietta herself, "and nothing; I wish would lose him." But she got bottom garden discovered garden door open, she altered her tone. "How silly leave door unlocked," she said herself. "Poor little fellow, poor Mike, I am coming, good dog. Heard someone, I suppose. Good gracious, what is that? I thought I saw something move there. I am getting nervous cat ever since men stopped us made kiss them, beasts. Ugh I I loathe them, although one really bad-looking. I wonder poor old friar went to. What that? Oh, nervous I feel. I wish left one house besides old deaf Constantino; he is nice company truly girl. Bother dog, noise he kicking up." And chatting thus, Marietta re-entered house. Meanwhile Mathias clambered iron balcony pushing open glass door, rather window, he entered room. It dining-room, remnants sumptuous repast yet upon table. "I will take glass wine." He did, too. He took several glasses wine, then, fumes good liquor mounted his brain, he grew generous, he lowered bottle window his two comrades beneath. Toro grasped it, sucked good half left his lips. Then Hunston finished draught. When Mathias regaled himself, he made move door. There one about. Not sound. Now his time. His object explore house, ascertain particular part cash, jewels, plate kept. When secured these, could content present least. Firstly, therefore, he tied silver spoons knives forks dinner table napkin, dropped bundle Toro's hat below. Then he crept back room passage. This done, he waited listen, assuring coast clear, he crept up. On next landing seven doors. Six shut, he peeped seventh room, he heard noise below. Someone coming stairs. What could he do? He stole back stairs listened. It Marietta. It really embarrassing job now, retreat, he crept upon tip-toe room, door stood ajar. It bedroom, dimly lighted oil lamp. A cursory glance showed room lately vacated, one ladies dressing ball. Within feet door looking-glass let wall panel, reaching floor ceiling. Mathias listened great anxiety footsteps stairs, every moment sounded nearer nearer. "I hope she come here," thought robber, "else I shall make her sure." He showed he meant "make her sure" toying hilt his dagger. Mathias crouched down, crept bed, time, pert young lady skipped room. Her first care turn lamp, light she looked her. "I think might taken ball them," she said, saucily shaking her curls her face. "I looked better them, I will bound. I am dead beat fatigue. I have work dressing them, get fun." She silent minutes, Mathias grew anxious. What could going forward? He would vastly like know. Unable control his curiosity, he peeped out, he saw pretty Marietta's portrait long looking-glass panel. She looked prettier ever now, for, shocking relate, young lady undressing. Mathias say bashful man, he draw back. On contrary, he stared his eyes. Pretty Marietta little thought, she stood glass, desperate villain watching every movement. Marietta, wholly unconscious she watched vile brigand chief, walked glass, shooting admiring glances herself her white well rounded shoulders. "Dress, rank, money wonders," she said. "Why equal? I am good best them, I am sure, much better looking." With mixture feminine vanity republican sentiments, she bustled about, putting room bit order. Now her first job put away several dresses. The first short Spanish skirt pink satin, deep black lace flounces. "I wonder I look this?" she murmured. She held dress beside her test colour her complexion. "Beautiful!" Beautiful; yes, her frank opinion, and, really, means sure her estimate near mark. On went dress. She strutted down, then, she feasted her eyes enough upon her loveliness, she plaited her hair, and, twisting rich knot behind, she stuck high comb it, fastened thick lace veil her. Mathias watched all. He gloated pretty little picture, and, shameless rascal! chuckled think little she suspected his presence. "There," she said, folding veil her head coquettish manner, "if I do not look prettiest señorita alive, why, call me--call anything odious--yes, even Englishwoman--ha, ha, ha! How would please mistress!" And she figured glass, capered Spanish bolero considerable grace dexterity, she sang impromptu verse old air. The verse naturally doggerel, maybe given English follows-- "Sweet Marietta, Rarely A sweeter better Face form seen; My chestnut tresses, And Spanish fall, Would eclipse dresses At masked ball. Then why, Marietta. Dally?--ah, no! Pluck up, you would better, Your courage go!" And she came last line, impudent little maid whirled round, spinning her skirts her like top. Mathias enraptured. With difficulty he kept applauding. "She would make her fortune upon stage," he said himself. Marietta made quite conquest; double conquest, might almost said. The hidden robber enraptured, she scarcely less pleased herself. "I will go," she said herself, "Why I not? They will never find out; I Cenerentola (Cinderella) did, knows prince might fall head ears love me? I get back long do." Out she skipped too, tripped stairs. She ball. Little dreamt she last half hour her life hung upon slender thread. And now, coast clear, three brigands prepared carry plans. CHAPTER II. AT THE CONTESSA'S FETE--A ROMANTIC ADVENTURE BETWEEN CERTAIN OLD FRIENDS. The brilliant fête year given rich Contessa Maraviglia her palazzo. All rank fashion land there. The palazzo building great beauty, stood grounds great extent. The contessa, widow, princely fortune, she spent lavishly too. Upon night masquerade gardens brilliantly lighted. Upon miniature lake fairy gondola, coloured lantern dangling prow, hung curtains pale blue silk gauze. In gondola lady seated. She taken gondola, alone sake freshness breeze upon water, read without interruption letter she received mysterious man professed deeply smitten her charms, who, messenger love let fall, prince. She wore black domino, masked, she threw back folds breathe freely, could see her veil thick fall black lace, fastened high comb back her head. "I hope he long," said she herself, her heart beat high expectation. "His note says clearly enough lake fairy gondola. Well, certainly nice princess, I hope his highness may prove dashing, handsome youth, Cinderella might sigh for. Hush, boatman!" "Lady?" "Do hear?" "Someone singing bank yonder? Yes! I hear, lady." "Row way." A voice heard carolling gently serenade--"Fair shines moon to-night." The voice meant well, evidently, something rather spoilt effect. It altogether tune, singer best idea world time. Perhaps his singing spoilt excess love. Perhaps liquor. The latter idea suggested certain unsteadiness would appear indicate love liquor. Be may, singer aware disadvantages he laboured. On contrary, he greatest belief himself. "Boatman," exclaimed lady, impatiently, "row ashore." "Yes, lady." He obeyed, he spoke, boat grounded, hidden minstrel stepped forward. The gallant rather tall man, masked habited long cloak, almost concealed glittering gorgeous costume beneath. This cavalier hastened tender lady his hand assist her disembark. As soon she fairly upon _terra firma_ gentleman led her away secluded part garden, ensued brief highly interesting conversation. It took place Italian language. That beautiful tongue say elegantly spoken upon either side. The gentleman spoke foreigner, imperfectly acquainted idiom. "Sir," said lady, embarrassing silence upon his part, "I scarcely know I ought here." "Nor I either, dear lady," began gallant. But then, aware exactly might expected him, he stammered broke down. "Poor prince," thought lady, unladylike chuckle herself. "How embarrassed he is." The cavalier stared her great eyes his mask, he muttered himself-- "She evidently love badly; I curious learn princess makes love. I anxious course study matter curiosity." "I ought come here, prince," said lady, nervous tone. Prince! The word made masked gentleman stare. "Prince! I suppose she cannot know I married man, goes straight question. This popping question sharply." He never made love lady degree, much less princess, he exceedingly anxious see she would begin upon occasion. But got quiet remote part garden, came dead lock. Not word spoken upon either side. "I wish he would say something me," thought lady. She used bashful suitors. "I kept appointment, sir," she said, "although I fear I wrong." "My appointment," muttered cavalier English, "Come, I like that." However, he added softest tones he could assume-- "Fear nothing, princess, I dangerous man." She thought he was, though, he said he chuckled. The lady dropped her eyes his bold glance looked timid could wish. Now appeared encourage gentleman, he seized her round waist pressed kiss upon part her cheek left uncovered her veil. She struggled feebly, oh, feebly release herself; libertine masker held her firmly; is, firmly possible, he strong upon his pins. "Sir, must take advantage unprotected situation," she faltered. "I sorry to, coy princess," said gallant. These words set her heart beating like clockwork. "He means well," she thought, growing quite easy her mind. Meanwhile ardent young lover, growing bolder encouragement, wanted remove her veil. "Grant one favour, princess," he said. "Let bask sunshine eyes; let feast vision upon rare beauty." The lady enraptured poetical imagery. "It sounds like lovely book," she murmured ecstasy. But she would accede his request. She filled joy, supremely happy, she feared break enchanting spell accident. "Desist, prince," she said, struggling gently his embrace, "I must gaze angelic face," said passionate Adonis. "Why," exclaimed lady, "since know well?" "Know it!" exclaimed gallant surprise. "Yes." "I never seen it." "Yet letter praises feature skies." "My letter!" He staggered evidently. "Undoubtedly." "I sent letter." The lady amazed "If sent letter, here?" she demanded. "In obedience yours," responded gallant. "My what?" "Your note--your ever-to-be-treasured missive," gushed swain. Now would followed way explanations impossible say, momentous crisis, voice close heard repeating softly couplet heard before-- "Dear Marietta, Never A sweeter neater Face form seen." The lady started screamed, would fallen protecting arm gentleman catch her. But her veil fell aside. When lover saw her face, he staggered, he nearly let her fall. "Marietta!" he exclaimed, "Marietta! Mrs. Harkaway's maid, that is wonderful." "Oho," screamed lady, "you are standing toe!" saying she jerked herself back, dragging his foot away too, he went. "It is Mr. Mole," shrieked lady; catching her pink skirt black lace flounces, she fled precipitately along path, leaving her admirer scrambling undignified manner upon gravel walk. Poor Mr. Mole. But oh, poor Marietta; sadly she disappointed her prince. CHAPTER III. MR. MOLE--THE THREE DEVILS AND THEIR DEVILMENT--THE CONTESSA'S JEWELS--AN ALARM. "Mr. Mole--Mr. Mole!" It Harvey's voice. Now Mr. Mole convinced Dick bottom comical conspiracy he made look ridiculous. So he resolved first make reply. But Harvey guided spot information furnished concerning Mr. Mole, soon he appeared sight. "Mr. Mole--Mr. Mole!" exclaimed Dick, grave reproof. "Help up, Harvey," said Mole, "and do not fool." "Well, that is polite." "Quite polite expect." "What mean?" "Oh, know I mean well enough." "I am hanged I do!" protested Harvey, stoutly. His manner caught Mr. Mole immediately. So led old gentleman reflect. If Dick know, would well keep adventure himself. "Is possible, Harvey, do not know occurred?" "No." "You do not know Marietta?" "No." This decided Mole. "Marietta here." "Never!" said Dick, accents deep mystery. "A fact." "Never! And dickens Marietta she home?" "Mrs. Harkaway's maid, sure." Dick burst laughing this. "Why, Mr. Mole," he cried, "what sly old fox are." Mr. Mole stared again. "I do not quite understand driving at, Mr. Harvey," said he. "Do not you, though?--well, I do, old Slyboots." "Harvey!" "Oh, do not try come old soldier me." "Sir!" said Mr. Mole, rearing his full height upon his timbers, "I do not understand slangy allusions ancient military." "Why, clear enough brought her." "I what?" almost shrieked Mr. Mole, indignantly. "Brought her, poor wife ought know it." "Sir?" said Mole, "if bent insulting me, I shall leave company." "Go it, Mole," said Dick, laughing tears came his eyes; "go it. The fact is, sneaking little girl long past; doubt it." "Harvey, I repudiate vile insinuations scorn, The fact is, anxiety fix wickedness never contemplated upon me, forget important part tale." "What?" "Why, girl left villa unprotected." "Nonsense! there is old Constantino there." "Useless." "And Mike." "He barks, do not bite." "Besides; may mistaken," urged Dick. "Not I. I knew her once, what is more, she recognised me." "The deuce!" "And she bolted directly I pronounced her name." "How she dressed?" Mr. Mole gave hurried description Marietta's dress, want search house grounds flighty Marietta. * * * * * In another part grounds three men met. "Hunston." "Toro." "Captain." "Here." "All safe?" "Yes." "Good!" "What learnt, Toro?" "Not much." "And you, captain?" "Nothing, next nothing," reply. "And you, Hunston?" "I gained knowledge," answered latter; "good, useful knowledge." The two laughed heartily reply. "You always studious turn mind, Hunston." "Ha, ha, ha!" [Illustration: "'WHAT HAVE YOU DISCOVERED?' ASKED THE CAPTAIN"--ADV IN GREECE, VOL II, PAGE 21] It may well mention sought secluded part contessa's gardens, met appointment. They three arrayed peculiar style costume prince darkness popularly supposed he makes his appearance German students, certain weird wild works fiction, supernatural drama. It sounded really remarkable hear three men, disguised devils, discussing matters generally offhand manner. The dresses three alike nearly every particular. The mark distinction small straight feather wore caps. One wore yellow feather. Another feather brilliant red. The third one's feather bright emerald green. Now feathers small, yet, reason conspicuous colours, could seen considerable distance. "What discovered?" asked captain. "Out it, Hunston," said Toro, his old impatient way. "Well, first place," Hunston's reply, "our letters old Mole girl Marietta perfectly successful." "Of course." "The vanity one, conceit other, made easy matter." "It did." "I saw interview snug place concealment, took care let her know it." "How?" "By humming her song heard her sing villa." The latter looked somewhat alarmed this. "Was prudent?" "Of course she see me, must get thorough hold girl, her accomplice enemy's camp always." "Good." "Now let us get back ball-room, see picked there." Back went, arrived large ball-room dance got up. The three diabolical companions deemed prudent separate, undue attention might drawn upon movements. And went sauntering rooms, upon look-out slice luck might turn up. Hunston added long red cloak his costume, envelope his figure cover his arm, fear accidentally running across Harkaway Harvey, fact, party. In cloak he wrapped, silently watching two young lovely girls, whose grace elegance commanding universal admiration. One fair lily, light, golden, wavy hair, full blue eyes. This beautiful girl excited Hunston's curiosity "Who she be? Perhaps Harvey's daughter," he thought Now two equally lovely gaze upon, beauty totally different character. "If spirit little Emily away mountains," said Hunston himself, "I shall able repay I suffered. Nay, more, I shall able satisfy greed Mathias band, making accursed Harkaway disgorge his enormous wealth." A hand placed upon his shoulder. "Hah!" "It I," said voice his ear. And looking up, he beheld devil red feather. "Mathias." "Hush! I rejoin lady now, I engaged dance." "The dance!" Mathias nodded. "She accepted dance devil; I will lead her devil dance." And brigand captain laughed hugely his conceit. But Hunston laughing humour. "I am glad find merry, captain." The Greek observe his gloomy manner; he replied--"You merry, too, I tell because." "I thought pleasures fools," said Hunston, gruffly; "I think business." "I too." "And yet going dance, Captain Mathias." "For business reasons, solely," said Greek. "Ho ho!" "My partner positively bristling diamonds," said brigand, significantly. Hunston interested immediately. "Diamonds?" "Aye! diamonds; diamonds, too. There one big nut, I swear." "I must see lady." "You shall." "Where she seen?" "Come me," said captain. Away went, squeezing crowds dancers maskers, came smaller ball-room, lady stood conversation big man, admirably got knight olden time. The lady Hunston recognised glance, description Mathias given her jewels. Her finely-rounded arms encircled bracelets, set richest diamonds, matched necklet priceless worth apparently. She wore tiara, too, costly making setting. The dance began. It waltz. Now gallant Mathias acquitted perfection dance, carrying his fair richly-attired partner crowded room without getting jostled dancers. Hunston followed movements greatest possible interest, shot past third time round room, he contrived take Greek captain's hand one lady's bracelets he dexterity removed. The next round he less successful. As shot past, brigand's hand outstretched, Hunston missed it, glittering object dropped floor. Hunston stooped recover it, when-- "The lady dropped something," said voice his ear. "What lady?" he demanded, recovering quickly, "The contessa." "Ah! I see. But contessa?" he asked. "Yes." "Are sure?" "Yes. It lady dancing half-brother." "Eh!" Hunston started little words. They sounded unpleasantly his ear. He evidently associated Mathias speaker. Now latter strange-looking little being. A stunted man, broad, square shoulders, got represent description Victor Hugo given us his creation Quasimodo. "That contessa?" said Hunston, recovering his presence mind. "Yes." "I glad it, I shall able restore proper owner." "Of course." Hunston arose, slight inclination head, crossed room, search contessa. The dwarf regarded eagerly he went. "That is rum one," he said himself. "He means pocket contessa's bracelet. What swindle! I thought something devilish his dress." * * * * * Hunston fled precipitately gardens. Close spot he previously met his companions crime, man awaiting big bundle. "Matteo, you?" "Yes, sir." "Good; give dress out. Quick! I must change, back absence noticed." As he spoke, he already torn hands man Matteo pair trunks blue cloth slashed amber silk, quick eye could wink, he them. And he fastened similarly coloured mantle. "Tell me, Matteo, change me?" "Yes, perfectly." "Good! take this." "What, jewels?" "Hush! hear all, see all, say nothing. Away you, now." "Yes. Where to?" "Back mountains, always guard made." "True." Just commotion ball-room, voice heard cry out-- "The contessa lost her richest diamonds precious stones. There robbers here. No one must leave grounds." "By Heaven!" ejaculated Hunston; "we lost." CHAPTER IV. HUNSTON'S ADVENTURE--MOLE IN A MAZE--HE MEETS AN EVIL SPIRIT--GROSS OUTRAGE ON HIS WOODEN LEGS--MATHIAS IN TROUBLE-THE ASSASSIN'S KNIFE. Quasimodo, detected one devils, Magog Brand. The audacity fearless Greek carried far, Quasimodo spoilt last. A number gentlemen company began inquire minutely affair. Prominent amongst Harkaway. He Jefferson, prompt act ever, inquired circumstances gross outrage, elicited depredator seen last diabolical costume. "A devil!" ejaculated one company. "Of course, I saw man myself." "I too," said another. "Yes, he wore red feather his high-crowned hat." "No," said another; "a feather, true, feather green, I sure." Upon this, Magog Brand came forward. "I saw done," he said. "I saw man it" "What, rob contessa?" "Yes, soon I saw It meant, I gave alarm; devil disappeared like greased lightning." "There!" exclaimed half dozen once, "I said devil." "Yes," added one guests, eagerly. "What coloured feather he?" "Red," ejaculated another, immediately. "Green," retorted opposite faction, loudly, Magog Brand said-- "It neither red green," said he, "but bright yellow." Now, inquiry proceeded with, nobody happened observe one singular circumstance. That presence, whole time, motley-coloured crowd, one diabolical trio question. This devil sooner heard question raised coloured feathers head gear, he doffed his hat unperceived pulled feather. And then, controversy grew warmer, he sneaked off. He made possible haste garden gate. Once he rush through, he accosted two men, whose uniform gave unpleasant twinge. They gendarmes. "You cannot leave ground yet, sir," said one sharply. "I do not wish to," replied devil, promptly. "I come bring orders." "I beg pardon," said gendarme. "A robbery committed." "Yes, sir." "That reason orders guard gate. Oh, know it. Well, do not know robbery supposed committed masker dressed I am. Take particular note dress." "Yes, sir." The gendarme grinned he said this. "Keep eyes open. These contessa's particular orders." "Trust me, sir." "There reward capture thief." The gendarme laughed this, said, air self-confidence--"I think I shall get him." The merry devil slapped gendarme upon back heartily. "You sort man money." Saying which, he turned left spot. Making his way place grounds previously agreed upon, he ran across brigand Matteo armed change dress him. The spot selected one narrowest alleys grounds, end species Hampton Court maze miniature. Just diabolical one divest half his skin, Matteo gave alarm. "The devil!" ejaculated masker, was, perhaps, natural exclamation he could make, things considered. "What be? Somebody watched here." He waited minute anxiety. An unsteady footfall heard upon gravel walk, man cloak came staggering along. "They may call grand _fête_ like," he mumbled. "I call shabby affair. Why, there is respectable drink place. The lucky thing I provided own." He bottle him, he sucked time time he staggered on, sudden he ran alarmed masker, growing impatient change his garments. The staggering one looked up, seeing alarming figure towering him, he gave wild howl fled. "The devil! devil!" he shouted wildly. "Help! help!" "Stop fool, Matteo, he bring whole house ears." Matteo seized merrymaker, make short work him, his superior held his hand. "Put knife," he said; "not that. Hold tight threaten him; knife." But timely interference, would gone hard unfortunate new-comer, old friend Mole. Mole, noted, compelled change his cork legs, he could scarcely stand, his old, familiar stumps, Harvey brought case accident occur. "Forgive me, Mr. Devil," he implored, drunken tones, "oh, forgive me." "Mole!" exclaimed devil, thrilling voice, "your evil deeds known me." "Oh, oh, oh!" groaned wretched Isaac, piteously. "Your time come." "Mercy, mercy!" gasped Mole. "Never." "Give little time, Mr. Devil." "No." "Oh, do, do, sake twins," said Mole, his persuasive manner, "and I will stand thing like to--hic--to name. Do not take away, come liquor me." "Silence!" thundered irritable devil "I am dumb." "Away you, repent." Mole staggered off. As soon he gone, Matteo assisted his master change his garments, space five minutes outside, devil disappeared, replaced gay cavalier, habited rich costume blue slashed amber, broad-brimmed sombrero. The excitement occasioned impudent robbery contessa Maraviglia's jewels means subsided, confusion prevailing consequence highly favourable Hunston's new villany trapping little Emily. Nearing entrance ball-room, he came conservatory, Mr. Mole strolled, let us say staggered, dropped seat. Hunston glided unperceived Mole, concealed behind thick shrubs close him. Mole bent upon making comfortable. The irrepressible bottle again. "I feel," mumbled Mole, little thinking listener near, "I feel I devil fellow. All ladies love me, men fear me. I am much anyone them, ha, ha, ha! I have taken rise devil himself." Here he suck bottle. "I am getting quite familiar evil spirits to-night," he said grinning; "I do not think he see hurry--he, he!" He raised bottle his lips, ghostly voice sounded his ear-- "Beware!" He turned pale, got red face. "Who is there?" said Mole, looking nervously round; "come in, do not knock; fool I am." "Remember!" said hollow voice before. "Oh, Lor', oh, Lor'!" cried Mole; "I am gone; he is again." "Beware!" "I am gone, I am going," cried Mole; "oh, Lor', oh, Lor'!" And he ran, Hunston following closely behind him. Now Hunston got near enough see he really trying get little Emily Paquita take care time, walk grounds. "There two take care of," said Hunston, following closely prudent; "that complicates matters. I hope Matteo taken his measures carefully." Matteo had. They drew near entrance maze, Hunston began look anxiously Matteo rest accomplices. "I think better return," he heard little Emily say. Suddenly whistle blown, five six men sprang maze. In less time takes record outrage, two girls seized borne stout, relentless arms, cries stifled thick wraps thrown heads. "To small gate," exclaimed Hunston. Mole recognised familiar voice Hunston, whole danger flashed his mind once, sobering effectually. "Hunston, villain, I know you!" he cried. "And I lose life rather harm come dear girls." Hunston turned faced savagely. "If know me, Mole," he said meaningly, "then beware me." Mole's reply grapple his strength. But foolish old man hurled ground, one brigands fell upon him, brandishing huge knife. Hunston interfered, gave command made men laugh heartily. A fresh outrage perpetrated, space two minutes, Mr. Mole found alone, his back. "Hunston, black-hearted thief," he cried, "I will follow if--" He tried rise, he went again. He lop-sided. And why? The brigands amputated one his wooden legs. * * * * * Leaving moment, let us return Mathias. That daring scoundrel satisfied escaped great danger scot free, made rich prize, he must needs return Palazzo Maraviglia another dress, quest fresh plunder. The fact he flushed wine. Else he would thought twice returning. Mingling crowd large ball-room, he came group discussing late robbery great excitement, he pressing forward learn he could, he became entangled lady's lace flounces. He turned sharply apologise, recognised figure once. "The lovely Marietta," Mathias exclaimed. She heard him, made end room, closely followed Mathias, conceived violent fancy her. "Stay, Senorita," he exclaimed, seizing her hand. "What want me?" said Marietta. "Only plead--" "Nonsense," she exclaimed, interrupting abruptly; "you do not know me." "Let plead--" "Bother!" "Nay," said persistent robber, "if hear speak, hear sing." And then, admirable mimic, he imitated her strut looking-glass, general coquettish behaviour dressing-room villa, he sang falsetto voice-- "Sweet Marietta, Rarely A sweeter better Face form seen. Dear Marietta!" "Hah!" cried girl, starting back she shot. Her first impulse faint. But soon she gained cooler air without, she recovered, collecting her senses little, she gave pretty shrewd guess truth. She silly, yet bad-natured girl. She saw her duty plainly enough. She must make herself known her master. Harkaway close hand, discussing robbery still Jefferson. The whole party course known Marietta; she made straight Harkaway, said hurriedly-- "Have man seized, sir--see, one following me. I Marietta. He said something convinces he hiding villa to-night." "Hullo!" exclaimed Harkaway, little startled sudden address; "why, Heaven's name--" "Lose time," interrupted Marietta eagerly, "or he go--see, he taken alarm." "The girl's right," said Jefferson, striding Mathias. The latter began perceive he made false step, he hurried crowded room towards door, passing out, dwarfed ugly figure leaped upon him. So sudden attack Mathias capsized, together rolled upon floor. "Let go!" said Greek fiercely, "or I will--" "Not me!" exclaimed Magog Brand--for he Greek's assailant. "I know you, yellow-feathered devil, even though she would skin!" "Let go," hissed Greek brigand, compressed lips, "or I will life!" "I will let go," cried brave little Brand. "I got you, villain, hold you. Ah!" Mathias scrambled up, tried fly, he met blow Jefferson's fist might felled ox shambles. He dropped lifeless ground beside Magog, And sudden outcry arose, found brief struggle poor Magog Brand cruelly used. A long-bladed poignard buried hilt his side. Poor Brand. Death must almost instantaneous. They tore mask Mathias' face, thereupon agent secret police stepped forward made known was. "This notorious Mathias," he said. "One daring brigands hereabouts; wanting badly time past." "You got him," said Harkaway, "but oh!" he added, glancing lifeless form Magog Brand, "at price us!" At juncture Harvey reached spot, taking whole scene glance, he dropped his knees beside body Magog Brand, Jefferson already kneeling, seemingly half stupefied catastrophe. "He fainted," said he Harvey. Harvey shook his head mournfully. "He will never faint again, Jefferson." "What?" "Never." "You surely--no, no, Brand, dear old boy, look up." He faltered broke down. "Yes, Jefferson," said Harvey deep emotion. "Poor Magog Brand end his troubles pleasures alike--he dead!" [Illustration: "'MURDER! ABDUCTION! SHOUTED MOLE HUNSTON IS HERE"--ADV IN GREECE VOL II PAGE 39.] CHAPTER V. THE PURSUIT OF THE BRIGANDS--THE BATTLE--VARYING FORTUNES--HOW HUNSTON AND TORO WERE LAID BY THE HEELS. Consternation upon every face. The catastrophe sudden unlocked for, people half stupefied fear. On one side lay poor Magog Brand, lately full life animation. On his assassin, felled dead man's best friend, doughty Jefferson, scarcely life his victim. And people staring hopelessly thus, voice heard giving alarm hard by. "Poor Brand, murderer shall escape," said Jefferson bitterly. The noise continued, presently voice recognised. "It Mole," cried Harkaway. He right. Just poor old gentleman appeared upon scene. "Harkaway, Jefferson, Harvey!" he cried. "What is matter?" "Murder!" returned Mole. "Hunston here." "By Heaven! I thought it," ejaculated Jefferson. "He carried Emily Paquita." "What?" "I interfered, many me. See used me." "Was he brigands?" demanded Harkaway. "I suppose so. A whole mob ruffians." "Where gone?" "By small gate." A hurried explanation ensued agent secret police, gave words comfort. "He will never able pass men gate," said officer, great confidence. This doubtful. They knew well Hunston's boldness audacity. But lost time getting pursuit. The contessa's stables well furnished, two horses speedily saddled Harkaway Jefferson. Harvey, impatient wait mount, rushed wildly away direction small gate, followed Mr. Mole. Here he saw his dismay scramble taken place, gendarmes got decidedly worst it. The two guard gate got roughly handled, one broken crown showing ugly wound side. "They gone way, then?" exclaimed Harvey, eagerly. "Yes." "Which way?" "They made right," faltered one wounded men. "Is long?" "No; moments." "They get far," said gendarme broken pate; "the two girls struggling hard him." "Hurrah!" cried Harvey. "I will save child yet." "You first hunt," said gendarme, speaking evident pain; "there two black men them." "That must Sunday Monday," exclaimed Harvey. And he ran. He bounded ground like deer, he got half mile on, he came suddenly upon two men struggling. One negro. Who, fact, old friend Prince Limbi, faithful Monday? The one Greeks, face unknown Harvey, one already figured pages. Matteo! And lying ground near brigand struck dead brave Monday. As Harvey came up, nearing end precious tough fight. Monday uppermost, Matteo, gradually succumbed wiry negro, time queer way indeed. Monday held throat, spite his desperate efforts set free, Matteo lost his breath. And he lay completely negro's mercy. "There, dam tief!" exclaimed Prince Limbi, "take dat, an' dat, an' dat, an' now, golly, dis little bit in." At every word he pressed harder harder jerked his adversary back. The "little bit in" settled Matteo completely. Something seemed crack wretched Greek's throat, he dropped back. "Monday, Monday!" said Harvey, eagerly, "where they?" "Hullo, Massa Dick!" said faithful Monday; "I'se gwine give fellar toko an' den I will jine yar." "He is done for," said Dick, hastily. "Come now." "He might come too," said Monday, doubt. "No fear." "Perhaps." "Why, he will never trouble anyone more," returned Harvey; "tell me, gone?" "They went straight on." "This road?" "Yes." "Good. Come stay. I will go," exclaimed Harvey. And he ran. Monday gave his silent enemy shake see over. "He is gone coon," he said himself. "I will bolt Massa Dick." Away he ran good swinging trot. In ten minutes he came him. And alarming circumstances. Not long horseman dashed spot, drew rein give glance lifeless form wretched Matteo. "He is dead," said horseman, none Jack Harkaway. "This looks like Dick's handiwork. Dick party. I hope Dick safe." Saying which, he whipped his horse, tore mad gallop. A moments he came brigands captives. Just nick time. Hunston Toro hands full, Greeks work take care two captive girls. Little Emily Paquita, recovered surprise, lending assistance keeping Greeks fully occupied looking them. And thus occupied, Sunday Dick Harvey engaged Toro Hunston. Dick rushed violently upon Hunston latter toppled over, looked though Harvey make short work old enemy. But alas Sunday! The poor negro overmatched. His heart good, weight enormous strength Italian much vanquish. That he yet succumbed Toro, due his vastly superior agility activity. It vain Italian ruffian try close him. Sunday would this. He knew his chance lay keeping Toro respectful distance. And he danced round him, dropping occasional smart rap goaded Italian fury. "Help!" cried Hunston. "Cut down! cut down!" One brigands rushed Harvey knife hand, thus created momentary diversion his favour. Had Harkaway appeared upon scene might gone hard his comrade Dick. Prompt, however, act critical juncture, Harkaway spurred his horse group rode down. Then reining up, he flung his horse, went melee. "I am it, Dick, old boy," cried Jack; "here is one Harkaway." "Hurrah!" shouted Dick, great excitement. "A Harkaway! Harkaway rescue!" Toro turned Harkaway cry rage. "Curse you!" he exclaimed; "I will life now, shall mine." "By means," said old Jack, cheerfully. "Cur!" "Come, now," said Harkaway, subdued rage, "I cannot stand that; take this!" And Toro knew he was, he got it. It pleasant he could wished he get it. A devil thud came upon his nose, fair blow Harkaway's fist, delivered straight shoulder, seemed Italian like kick donkey. Toro shook over. His eyes flashed fireworks, he half stunned moment. Harkaway's triumph temporary. One Greeks, watching conflict giants combat great interest, crept behind Jack, seizing suddenly round middle, hurled ground. "Ha, ha!" yelled Toro. And bounding forward, he fell upon Harkaway, knife hand. "At last, last, life hands," he cried fiend-like joy. The knife gleamed air. A piercing shriek little Emily heard. A cry fear Paquita, suddenly latter, disengaging herself her captors, bounded forward seized Toro hair. She dragged back her strength, little was, saved life Jack Harkaway. Jack put forth his strength critical juncture, succeeded grappling his herculean opponent. Toro lost his balance. A moment he rolling upon ground deadly battle brave Jack Harkaway. So fierce strife could last long. In heat combat cries heard encouraging Harkaway Harvey fresh exertions, dashed bold Monday, closely followed Jefferson several gentlemen contessa's fête. The Greeks began lose heart. The odds veering round wrong side. Greeks fight moderately well three four one Englishman, numbers equal, care provoke hostilities. And blew upon whistles assistance, soon answering calls came every direction, causing gravest fears Harkaway faction. "Hah!" ejaculated Jefferson; "they coming help you. But least I will make sure you, Master Toro." The Italian shirk encounter. Toro, justice, was, his faults, coward. He felt weight Jefferson's arm, he reason remember it. Yet he met his old adversary boldly. Jefferson fell upon huge Italian tiger-like fury, spite his prodigious size weight, he lifted his arms, swung round, hurled ground. The Greeks now, seeing leaders dire peril, thought avenging dastardly o| expedients. "Kill girls!" cried one them. The hint caught avidity. A savage yell responded bloodthirsty suggestion, lives two innocent girls real peril. "Look girls!" shouted Dick Harvey, fully occupied two Greek brigands pressing closely. There cheer response appeal, went two Greeks. Jefferson lent hand juncture. Finding free Toro's attentions, huge Italian received desperate shaking his fall he fit much now, he rushed _mêlée_, dealt slogging blows least dozen bleeding noses black eyes distributed amongst bandits rather less time takes note fact. The Greeks thoroughly discouraged. This unpleasant British mode attack liking. They could pretty well knives swords, even firearms, could regard men used fists lights savages. Gradually retreated fierce onslaught Britishers gallant Yankee ally. This small triumph. The brigands mustered least twenty men. Their enemies five. The five Harkaway, Harvey, Jefferson, two negroes Sunday Monday. The chicken-hearted Greeks, however, altogether turn tail, ere could get fairly hardly-contested field, received considerable reinforcements. About ten Greeks put appearance. A ragged, ruffianly crew, ill armed. The Harkaway party armed all. The Greeks fell back made attempts re-form something like good order. But Jefferson saw danger, he followed closely. Jack Dick Harvey his heels. Neither old friends inferior bold Jefferson courage; possess his great advantages size strength. Jefferson's right arm went like battering ram, time he struck out, dropped his man. At events, brigands give particular signs coming repetition dose. The huge American dashed thick enemy. The assassination poor little Magog Brand fired his fury, his charge something terrific. He dashed midst half cowed bandits, swinging his arms around like sails windmill, he "grassed" man every stroke. But could last long. As Greeks grew stronger numbers, stood upon defensive. They reassured. They seven-and-twenty men five. The five, too, large-hearted though were, two girls look after. Amongst latest comers upon bandits' side one man petty officer brigands, he gave hurried commands, effect putting Harkaway his friends awkward predicament. "Load fire," said brigand, "Shoot down." If could succeed getting shot two bold Jefferson, party, would speedily them. But now, individual bravery could longer avail them, rare slice luck. Suddenly rattling volley musketry heard, three Greeks bit dust, number cries told several hit. And detachment gendarmes dashed open swinging trot. And headed welcome party? Who two youths heard pages? Who indeed young Jack Harkaway his friend Harry Girdwood? CHAPTER VI. SUNDAY RUBS OFF AN OLD SCORE--THE BRIGANDS--WHAT HAPPENED AT THE PORTER'S LODGE--A STRANGE BLIND BEGGAR. "Hurrah!" "Give another." "Load again." "Another volley." A rapid, irregular discharge followed, Greeks, cries fear rage, dropped arms fled precipitately, panic-stricken. The gendarmes followed up, several knocked secured; behind brigands left less seven number able get off. Amongst seven two men small gratification Harkaway party see power. These two men Hunston Toro Italian. Sunday stood latter, leathering his half insensible carcase way threatened cover bruises; every blow he something fresh say. "Take dat!" he exclaimed, punching Toro's ribs, "you dam nigger." Toro, dazed he suffered his shaking, could offer resistance. "And dere's another, ugly tief!" said virtuous Sunday. "I will gib for; shall hab Paddy gib drum, 'fernal black skunk; I show yar John orchard is, you--you Italian organ-grinding sweep--You chestnut-munching beast!" Sunday never forgotten his first acquaintance Toro. The reader doubtless bear mind, since connected one startling episodes Jack Harkaway's history, his voyage round world young Jack. It hotel New York Harkaways first met Sunday, too, means rescuing brutal violence ruffian Toro. It was, fact, led scene terror--the firing hotel Hunston Toro. Sunday suffered Toro's hands, never his whack back. But darkey showed half insensible Italian full signification "John de orchard," likewise "what for," "what Paddy gave drum." * * * * * Hunston Toro thrown prison, brigands captured discomfited chieftain Mathias. Such end exploit. When prison, however, required exertion part authorities keep there. The gang unceasing endeavours release them. Artifices every kind tried accomplish it, Harkaways foreseen stone would left unturned murderous friends captured robbers; knew good old-fashioned saying--"forewarned, forearmed.'" The prison confined situated waterside, approachable boat, entrance beneath low, vaulted archway. The day capture notorious robbers, poor cripple hobbled porter's lodge, dragging painfully along aid stick one hand crutch his arm. "Move off," said porter gruffly; "we nothing give away here." "I do not ask charity," replied cripple humbly; "accept this, good sir, peace offering." And then, porter's surprise, he dropped coin his hand. The porter looked hard coin his hand, cripple. He man sentiment, porter, he asked generous donor bluntly he wanted money. "I want show consideration kindness, possible, unfortunate inmates place," reply. "Prisoners?" "Yes." "If expect that," said porter "you better take back money, I nothing prisoners." The cripple looked grave, he muttered himself-- "This fool beastly conscientious. If he proved bit rogue, chance--the ass!" But he mean yield point yet. "You good man," he said porter, "a worthy honest fellow, know I do not mean offer thing like bribe." The porter started. "A bribe!" he said, expletive. "You better not." "Ahem!" coughed cripple. "My friend, I confined prison son, poor misguided boy--" "They mostly that," said porter shortly. "But he innocent." "They innocent," said porter. "All?" "According showing." "But boy is." "No doubt" "And I want beg soften his lot--a hard lot is, too." "I nothing, I tell you," said porter; "I never see prisoners." "I thought--" "At least, I say never, I mean allowed walk prison yard." "That here?" "Yes." "When that?" "Once day; sometimes that, doctor orders it." "The doctor must order it, then?" said cripple himself. "What son for?" asked porter. "For unfortunate resemblance he bears notorious brigand." "Bah!" exclaimed porter. "They do not imprison man like another." "Yes, do; unlucky son taken Mathias brigand." "What," ejaculated doorkeeper, "do mean Mathias Mathias?" "I mean son taken Mathias, whom, indeed, he like nothing capture real culprit save son." The doorkeeper eyed cripple sharply. But latter stood coolly enough. "Well," said door porter, "if case, certainly hard job son. What want him? I cannot let out." "My friend," exclaimed cripple, "think I would suggest thing? No, I would ask soothe kind word." "I will tell next he comes out." "At time say?" asked cripple, looking ground though he put question casually. "At twelve." The cripple's eyes glistened he heard this. "Well, well," he said, pressing money door porter's hand, "I will call again, perhaps may seen boy, comforted assurance I will save him, spite ill accursed English people work aid money." "Oh, that is it, it?" said porter. "The English work it, eh?" "Yes. They owe spite, money, know, buy thing--any thing." And blessing gatekeeper, he hobbled off. * * * * * Near prison he overtook blind man begging roadside, stopping drop coin his hat, cripple contrived whisper hurried words effect-- "I made step--almost made breach fortress." "You have!" And blind man turned his head right left, almost though looking see unwatched. "Yes; prison yard side gate. Now gate kept porter already interest." "Good, good, Tomaso!" quoth blind man. "Now, listen." "Go on," returned blind man, eager tone. "At noon prisoners yard. If could get gate open instant, men ready hereabouts rush--" "Yes, yes." "Who tell may happen?" "Good again--good again! ha, ha, ha! that is brave, is. Why, mob idle sightseers crowd prison gates noon watch prisoners might poor blind wretches helpless cripples like I." "Of course." "And gate left open one instant--a single inch, more--why, worlds might done." "A horse ready saddled near hand might worth thinking of." "True." "And small keg gunpowder blown archway waterside entrance would divert attention." "Tomaso," ejaculated blind man, "you are born captain brigands day!" CHAPTER VII. HOW TOMASO HELPED HIS FRIENDS IN TROUBLE--THE SKIRMISH IN THE PRISON--MATHIAS THE BRIGAND. Tomaso, day over, changed his garments abandoned crutch stick, he turned flaxen-dyed hair spectacles, presented great entrance prison, German traveller desired go place, one could possibly imagined old cripple whose paternal lamentation touched doorkeeper's heart. "You got notorious brigand, I heard tell," said visitor. "We have, sir," governor's reply; "a remarkable man he is, too." "Ah, I heard," said visitor. "He called Demetrius, I believe?" "Nay; his name Mathias." The visitor looked surprised information. "Mathias--Mathias!" he repeated himself. "I misinformed, then. I certainly thought his name Demetrius." The governor smiled. "You may right, same," said he. "How so?" "Why, Mathias his avowed name; he may known dozen different _aliases_." "Is possible?" ejaculated sham German traveller. "Indeed is. These robbers mostly adepts disguise. Would like see Mathias?" demanded governor, courteously. "Vastly." "Well, sir, I will warn one thing." "Indeed! What it?" "A disappointment awaits this." "How so?" "Instead seeing ferocious fellow, might expect, Mathias really pleasant innocent-looking man." The governor prison led visitors long stone corridors place Mathias confined. They stopped door great thickness, heavily barred, studded iron bolts nails. The governor tapped small grated trap door, pulled aside. At grating broad-shouldered fellow appeared, touched his cap visitors. "So Mathias," said German gentleman. "No, no," said governor; "that gaoler shut him." "What for?" "So he might watched night day; authorities doomed to--" "To what?" "To death," replied governor, low impressive voice. "He young." "In years, yes," answered governor, "but old crime. This man guilty nearly every crime sun--brigandage one his least offences. His last exploit, however, worst." "What that?" "Murder." "Murder!" And German traveller looked inexpressibly shocked. "Murder capital crime every land." "And rightly too," said visitor, "rightly, too. But, sir, excuse curiosity--" "Ask will," returned governor. "This man had, I told, bold, dashing fellow second his exploits." "An Italian?" "No." "An Englishman?" "No, no, sir, mistake; I mean Greek--a handsome, dashing fellow--a great favourite ladies--brave daring." "And Apollo called?" "Tomaso." The governor burst loud fit laughter this, "You altogether mistaken brigand--that Tomaso. He scrubby ill-favoured scamp--a sneaking, crawling rascal, capable villany his master, possessed his courage." Had governor looking visitor's face then, he might his suspicions aroused. The sham German philanthropist glared ferociously description given. The prisoner, seated rough deal table end cell, arose gaoler's order, came window. A single glance sufficed show noticeable change taken place appearance Mathias. His face pale haggard, whole one side it, eye, cheek bone, forehead bruised. This mark Jefferson set upon him. This bold American's vengeance deathblow brigand dealt upon his faithful friend companion Magog Brand. Jefferson's right arm came like steam hammer, man felt full force scoundrel Mathias forget readily. Such desperate shaking given Mathias he yet recovered. The bold, defiant bearing man gone, he looked ten years older Tomaso he last met. It struck visitor once. "Dear, dear me," exclaimed latter, "is possible redoubtable Mathias?" "It he," said governor, "yet scarcely gay his will not, eh, Mathias?" The prisoner shrugged his shoulders sighed. "Laugh on, excellency," he said, rather bitterly, "it turn now." "Now!" "Aye, now. It may always be." "Why, surely never think getting this?" "Indeed, I think nothing else morning, noon, night." The governor gave sharp glance about. He looked toward gaoler. Now gaoler huge fellow, six feet high broad proportion, one could tackled Toro himself, far weight sheer brute strength went. "Your excellency," replied Mathias, "when I leave place, exit due violence. Bad I am, I altogether would make out." "Poor Mathias!" said governor ironically, "one would almost think murder his line business." "Your excellency," said prison, drawing near grated window, "I repent sincerely poor little gentleman's death; assassin's stab dark, unfortunate blow fight, remember." "Bravo! Mathias! bravo!" ejaculated visitor. The prisoner looked up. A strange expression flitted across his face. Mathias adept art dissimulation, his face schooled tell neither less he wished. "Now, excellency," said visitor, "this rascal appears strangely self-possessed." "He does." "What mean?" "Brag." "Humph!" "Ah, know him, sir, well I do." "Perhaps not; might possible he league his comrades outside." The governor smiled incredulously. "Impossible." "What scoundrel, Tomaso, speaking, work?" The prisoner's eyes glistened word. A slight flash intelligence passed prisoner visitor. It momentary, slight utterly unobserved either gaoler governor. "And could case, sir, could he possibly do, eh? What earth, that is I ask." "There is saying." "Indeed you are right." "Only he ought well guarded change one prison another, or--" "Stop, stop, dear sir, change him? He never leave place alive," said governor. "Never?" "Never!" "But surely do not keep prisoners confined stifling places?" "We do, though." "And never let breathe air? Why, torture." "They breathe air. At noon every day allowed walk hour prison yard." "At noon?" "At noon." The visitor fixed his eyes strangely upon prisoner. "Very good; I may allowed trespass again, I like see fellow bears yard amongst his fellow-criminals." "By means." "I will come, then, noon." * * * * * At noon next day German traveller good his word. The governor, full his wonted courtesy, accompanied yard, prisoners walking round two two. Some desperate men fastened single handcuff wrist another man--a warder. Of category brigand Mathias. His companion huge fellow, topped head shoulders, wrists linked securely together strong--if slender--pair handcuffs. The visitor's countenance fell he observed this. It upset his plans one fell swoop. However, he utterly despair, made effort get difficulty. "Your excellency," said he, "this indeed cruel." "What," demanded governor, "fastening gaoler?" "Yes." "I order special cases, Mathias." "He dangerous?" "Well, I scarcely believe that, precautions established rules." "I regret that." "Why?" "Partly score humanity," reply. "Ah, would tender-hearted," said governor. "No. But I also regret I hoped see brigand like he appears restraint. I suppose would like set free?" The governor shook his head. "That custom, I really like it." The visitor reflected moment walked on. He could abandon his scheme he gone far. The effort made same. They walked porter's lodge beside gates, eager crowd assembled glimpse prisoners. "And open gates admit prisoners?" asked visitor innocently. "No, sir," replied governor; "this little side door open. Now watch done. This bar, like lever, stops door, renders immovable, now--hah!" The fallacy his words shown ere fairly uttered. The visitor whistled peculiar way. And sudden silent rush door question. The bar, immovable was, fell desperate onslaught, door carried hinges. The ragged miserable-looking mob turned like magic crowd armed desperadoes. And pressed. On came, tearing gates dashing every thing them. The poor gatekeeper trampled foot, warders governor got hustled cruelly handled. The mob armed invaders made Mathias his companion, bore bodily outside gates. The brigands wrenched handcuffs. Once outside gates, horse found waiting. Suddenly loud cry heard. "The soldiers--the soldiers!" The whole guard-room turned out. A charge made, looked though rescue Mathias likely cost dear. Cries defiance rage heard. Just matters worst robber band, deafening explosion heard, shook solid building base. The soldiers turned back re-formed officer's command. Then brigands, headed sham visitor, Tomaso, found chance. Up till now, retreat cut unpleasant appearance military. "There goes powder keg water gate," cried Tomaso. "Lose moment. Follow me." A desperate rush made, brigands got clear prison. The soldiers divided two lots, one party sent pursuit, remaining guard prison. The roll-call prisoners made discovery. "How many prisoners escaped?" inquired governor. "Three absentees, excellency," said head man prison. "One Italian, calling Toro; another Englishman, calling Hunston; third, brigand chief Mathias." CHAPTER VIII. A DEEP-LAID PLOT. The news escape, rescue--call will--of three desperadoes soon became known. Emily Mrs. Harvey much alarmed. The dogged obstinacy attempt attempt made villains made imagine unsafe lonely place. Accordingly, grand consultation held, result Prince Limbi sent town take rooms whole party one two hotels place could boast of. And next day quitted villa. The hotel friends secured apartments large straggling building, right extremity ill-built street formed chief part town. Mr. Mole particular went his inquiries brigands. Would party quite safe molestation? The urbane proprietor, many low bows, assured his excellency Englishman slightest possibility molested. The male members party really troubled little brigands. By ten of the clock, day masquerade, hardly person stirring town. A casual observer would said literally one seen. But hush! Soft, cautious footsteps may heard, anyone whose eyes accustomed gloom might seen three figures creeping quietly street side opposite hotel. Right building paused. "That place" said one three, giant almost size. "Curse them! always manage get comfortable quarters, I outcast," said another, spoke like Englishman. "Death, gentlemen! better quarters desire cave, spent several pleasant evenings?" "Bah! Captain Mathias, never tasted sweets civilisation." "And, Signor Hunstani, much better tasted sweets?" "Peace, peace!" growled giant. "Let us unite thought action, to-night obtain long-sought revenge." "Well, Toro, I sure I do not want quarrel anyone, except Harkaway." "Curse him! especially American." "Hush! let curses loud deep; you will awake town swear so." "Have I good to? Has he beaten put shame?" "And I suffered equal pain shame? Yet I content bide time; patience, Toro." "Come, come business, friends," said Captain Mathias; "there house foe resides. How proceed?" "Quietly; hush!" said Hunston. "Confound it, still air is; whole street seems echo back lightest whisper." "Let get inside, I care street hears," muttered Toro. "Which proves care unsuccessful," said Greek. "How so?" "If heard, shall whole street arms us, I fancy Inglesi, boys blacks, quite sufficient three us." "Bah!" exclaimed Toro. "Seriously, though, let us consider get place," said Hunston. "There is door facing us." "But key?" "No, I could send foot plank easily anything," growled Toro. "Certainly, would undoubtedly alarm whole household so, whereas wish catch sleeping." "Well, then, windows?" "Too high reach," said Hunston, "unless ladder." "And I doubt thing found town," interposed Captain Mathias. "Well, then, let us see back house. Captain, eyes like cat owl; glance street see anyone about." The Greek looked directions. "Not even mouse stirring," said he. So three villains, drawing cloaks closely round them, stole silently away shelter friendly doorway, foregoing conversation taken place, proceeded round back hotel. To reach point desired, had, course, cross road, tolerably wide, skirt kind paddock. There stars seen, moon--a new one, perhaps yet fully acquainted her business--was partly hidden behind clouds, though entirely obscured forms three brigands cast deep shadows ground. But surely shadow, move, moves also adjoining doorway, follows them. Like them, wrapped cloak; like them, stalks along slowly erect, unlike them, makes noise. Its footfall silent panther lurking jungle. Its breath, any, seems hushed. The three villains go slowly, shadow, substance, whatever may be, keeps pace, till reach open field back hotel. Hunston, Toro, Greek stand side side looking towards hotel, shadow sinks sight side fence. Another hasty look round, Greek brigand pronounced safe. "No fear interrupted here." "Well let us settle," said Toro; "I anxious them." "But see," said Hunston, "there lights moving; safe yet." "Not till half-an-hour midnight." "And now----" "It half-past ten of the clock." "Two hours," groaned Toro. "Better wait four fail," said Hunston. "Cold-blooded Englishman, know furious rate blood boils veins? In house man struck earth." "Wait two hours, may good chance paying score." "And I will, too, greater interest even usurer charged his hapless client. I wonder room cursed Americano sleeps in." "The third room right-hand side first corridor, ascend great staircase." Captain Mathias said promptly positively though he shown friends bed. After pause he continued-- "Mr. Mrs. Harkaway first room; Mr. Mrs. Harvey second; third double-bedded apartment, one couch occupied American, two boys." "You seem pretty exact information, captain," said Hunston. "Yes, little going come ears. One porters spy employ." "Why get key him?" "I one; opens back door." Toro had, last bit conversation, growling choice vocabulary Italian oaths, occasionally shaking his fist building contained objects his hatred. He turned his companions. "And propose pass two hours must elapse?" "At bottom yonder field thicket, shall free observation. We smoke pipes there. By-the-bye, patrol goes round midnight." "We must cautious," said Hunston. "Come along, then." The three villains walked direction thicket hide. A minute afterwards shadow rose ditch he crouching, stood looking long lost gloom. "Just time," muttered so-called shadow, good truth substantial flesh blood Greece. "If I wandered hither search daughter, probably half-a-dozen murders would committed. However, I will thwart rascals, sure name Petrus." For Petrus was, Magic Island, playing spy movements three conspirators. He stood deep thought minutes. "I must warn people hotel, I like get business without alarming Mrs. Harkaway lady. The question is, how?" He reached front door hotel, pulled bell handle. After interval two three minutes, light shone keyhole, voice asked-- "Who there?" "A traveller, search food bed." "Are alone?" "Yes." Then door unbolted, traveller entered. "Is proprietor hotel bed yet?" he asked. "I do not know, sir." "He must roused once. I important news distant land." The porter stared, seem inclined call proprietor, noticing which, Petrus said-- "I shall sorry alarm house, I want one person; do not quickly bring him, I will ring half dozen bells rate he will think house fire." Seeing stranger earnest, porter went proprietor's room, soon returned hall Petrus waiting. "I like words _in private_, sir," said traveller, strong emphasis words italicised. "Certainly. You may go bed, Theodorus." The porter somewhat sulkily retired kind pantry, he slept, proprietor hotel, softly following, turned key upon him. "I doubts fellow," he said he returned. "But now, sir, pleasure me?" Petrus told he heard, great alarm hotel-keeper. "What shall do? Send police?" Petrus, short silence, said-- "No." "What then? I cannot allow guests murdered. Why, scoundrels already made one attempt Mr. Harkaway his friends masquerade." Just moment guttural voice heard singing-- "Ole Ikey Mole Was lushy ole soul, And lushy ole soul he." "Now den, nigger, quiet," said another voice. "Who people?" asked Petrus. "Two black men attendance Harkaway party," said proprietor hotel. "Just men. I know little them. I fought side side them. Now I proposal make, put brigands flight ludicrous manner, annoy beaten fight. Myself black men assistance permission." "Anything, bloodshed." "That I guarantee. Please call two worthy dark-skins." Sunday Monday, keeping kitchen, called acquainted state affairs. "What, Massa Petrus," said Sunday surprise, "what here? Am got dat black rascal pirate you?" "No; pirate chief dead. You find his bones island--Magic Island, young Jack Harkaway named it. Yes, revenge complete. The pirate died slave; explain plan punish three brigands." Sunday rolled his eyes fearfully, he listened details plot. "Gorra, massa, I would like tar feather dat big rascal." "Tar!" said Petrus. "Ha, ha, ha! good idea. Listen--but first show place gentlemen sleep." The hotel-keeper led way corridor, pointed sleeping apartments Harkaway party. Petrus held another short consultation two black men hotel-keeper, result latter retired, leaving Sunday, Monday, Petrus work invaders appeared. And then, little time spare, set work make necessary preparations. Over door screwed wall iron hook, attached pulley cord. Then went lower regions hunted store rooms. The first place lighted upon kind paint shop, full paints, oils such-like things. "Dis jes de shop cook de goose ob dem willins," said Sunday. "And here is de pots cook  them in," said Monday, pointing iron vessels resembling pails, made bottoms could removed. The pails, call them, something like sugar loaves, tops cut turned base upwards. When full, weight liquid kept bottom place, evident bottom removed, easily could be, contents would escape. Petrus, inspection, pronounced "just thing," adding-- "Now must fill tar." "No, no," said Monday. "Put tar one, wery hot; nodder put dis paint, also werry hot; de oder put water, bilin' hot." "Good." Then three sat large fireplace kitchen, deliberately began cooking. Monday devoted his attention heating several pounds mixed paint. Sunday boiled barrel tar, Petrus attended large cauldron water. Ten minutes hands clock pointed half-past twelve, cooks completed work. The paint, tar, water, boiling heat, placed iron pails movable bottoms, one hung bedroom door. The hot water Harkaway's door, paint Harvey's, tar two boys Jefferson reposed. A string attached pail, passed pulley, end conveyed recess three watchers concealed. They armed. Sunday, Monday, Petrus six-chambered revolver, loaded. Then came clang old-fashioned clock proclaimed half-past twelve. Breathless silence prevailed inside house out. "Lights out," whispered Petrus, when, short pause, slight grating noise heard back door. In instant darkness, except moon shone narrow window extreme end corridor. A minutes afterwards Petrus, watching, saw three dark figures come gliding long passage. The first tall, bulky figure--Toro. The second Greek, third evidently Hunston. A plan operations agreed upon--that quite certain; Toro, without least hesitation, proceeded Jefferson's door, Greek placing outside Harvey's apartment, Hunston stationed room occupied Harkaway. Then waited signal, evidently intending rush simultaneously. "Now!" said Hunston, loud whisper. "Now!" echoed Petrus. Before brigands could rush rooms occupied sought destroy, Petrus pulled three strings he held his hand, and, good Heaven! spluttering swearing commenced. Hunston drenched scalded. "A million curses!" he roared. "Help! Look here, Toro." But Toro could look. A deluge hot tar streamed his head, filling eyes, ears, nose, mouth, saturating his hair running inside his clothing. "Furies!" he screamed, "I will life villain done this! Mathias, knife, man." But poor Greek utterly cowed; paint destroyed his senses save feeling, fully exercised. Hunston, although severely scalded, managed keep certain proportion his wits him. "Come, lads--quick, value lives!" he exclaimed. "Away! must risk capture." He endeavoured drag away. At moment, however, another actor appeared scene. This Nero. That wide-awake member monkey tribe doomed share Sunday's apartments, neat bed made one corner. Hearing noise, and, perhaps missing his companion (brother, Jefferson said), he came down, carrying his dexter paw well-filled pillow. He seemed recognise Toro once. The valorous ape leaped forward, gave his Italian foe bolstering Toro never heard of, three spectators laughed applauded loudly. Crack! The ticking pillow gave way, shower feathers enveloped unhappy son Italy, whose oaths execrations literally smothered. "Golly! an't he downy cove?" said Monday. At juncture, Hunston managed grasp his companions hand, dragged downstairs back door. Only time, however, Jefferson, hearing noise, rushed out, scanty costume, true, fully armed pistol bowie knife, eager fray. "What matter?" he demanded. Petrus explained briefly. Jefferson rushed door fired two shots fugitives, who, however, managed get away. Then door securely bolted, affair explained alarmed inmates house, retired bed, Harkaway his friends shaken Petrus warmly hand, promise he see his beloved daughter morning. CHAPTER IX. THE BRIGAND'S CONSPIRACY--THE ARAB ASTROLOGER--HARVEY'S FIRST APPEARANCE AS A MESMERIST. "They making fresh efforts get Mathias out," said Dick Harvey his friend Harkaway. This beginning conversation took place residence Harkaway party three days daring audacious attack hotel. Mathias captured patrol endeavouring escape, thrown gaol again. "Hang impudence!" said Jefferson. "Will nothing daunt them? I wish one entered room night; I would held faster seems prisons can." "These two restless vagabonds games again," exclaimed Dick. "You mean Toro?" "Aye, Hunston." "What done now?" demanded Jefferson. "They trying tamper gaolers." "How discovered?" "The traitor, whoever he may be, let fall letter he carrying Mathias." "That is lucky. Well, discover thing?" "No; written cypher." "The cunning rascals!" "Now, I have got news you," Dick went say. "Out it, then." "You heard Arab tells fortunes town?" "Mehemed Sadan, great necromancer?" "Yes. Would surprised learn he one Mathias' band?" "Why, scoundrels finger every pie." "True," said Harvey. "Now, I notion offer you. I propose go test truth I say." "How?" "I will tell go. Are agreed?" "I am willing," said Harkaway; "any thing little excitement." Off went. Mehemed Sadan, Arabian magician, carried his occult practices house best part town, his surroundings tended show "black art" proved profitable commerce him. When Harkaway, Jefferson, Harvey arrived there, ushered presence magician negro fancifully attired, wearing silver bands round his wrists ankles, dangled chains small bells attached. Mehemed Sadan seated high-backed chair, close long table, long cloth black velvet, covered mystic signs letters, much Greek visitors. The room filled kinds things calculated impress vulgar superstitious awe. The effect altogether lost upon Dick Harvey, he made point nodding Arab astrologer familiar manner. "Morning you, old fellow," he said, cheerfully. "Salaam, sahib," responded necromancer, gravely. "Hullo!" said Jefferson, opening his eyes, "why, Arab talks Hindustani." "Leave me," said Dick Harvey, undertone. The Arab said words company generally, company generally could make rather less addressed Chinese. "He is talking known language sun," said Harkaway. "It is opinion he got cheek talk regular right-down gibberish us." It true. The words, sounds, let us say, necromancer uttering, sounded much like "hokey-pokey kickeraboo abracadabra," rest mysterious sounds conjurer juvenile parties seeks invest his performance additional wonder, benefit his youthful audience. Dick rage. "Confound his impudence," he exclaimed; "I will give one." So he let wise-- "Chi ki hi-you-thundrinold umbuggo--canardly keep thievinirons wool--I like land one smeller tap claret." At which, surprise magician, visitors burst laughing. The Arab necromancer asked them, good Greek, object visit. "We shall understand much addressed Greek," said Harkaway; "try Italian." And found conjurer spoke Italian well, better, party. "Can tell me," said Jack Harkaway, way beginning business, "if I shall succeed present object desires not?" The magician bowed his head gravely. Then he opened large volume covered mystic characters. For minute two he appeared lost deep study, he gave his reply. "Your desires tend downfall lawless men, I find," he said, watching keenly, he expected see jump surprise his words. "They do." "And succeed." "Does art tell I shall fail?" asked Jack. "No; I see disappointment trouble yours." "Dear, dear, shocking," exclaimed Harkaway, winking Harvey. "Dreadful!" added Dick, terrified look, putting his tongue magician. "What else art tell you?" demanded Jefferson, anxious know far necromancer would venture try humbug them. "I see here," said conjurer, drawing his finger along line something open "book fate," looked like Arabic, "I see lives menaced, one all, keeping wretched man restraint." The visitors looked exchanged smile. "Your art fault," said Jefferson; "we one restraint." "You way connected it." "Wrong again." The wizard looked uncomfortable this. "Strange," he said, "and yet I read clearly might written book." "You mistaken," said Jefferson; "we way concerned thing kind." The wizard pored mystic tome again. "I say then," he said, "for clearly indicated. You especially mentioned immediate his downfall." "How I indicated?" demanded Jefferson. "By letter J." "Which take for?" "Your initial." "Humph! far out. What audacious humbug fellow is," said Jefferson Jack. Now, foregoing scene, young Jack Harry Girdwood joined party, Dick Harvey observed close conversation them. At point Harvey turned two lads towards Jefferson. "The astrologer right," he said, gravely. "What devil mean?" exclaimed Jefferson. "You right, sir," added Dick magician himself. The latter bowed. "I doubt not," he said; "the stars speak falsely." "No, no." "And may convince friend I say less truth." "I can," said Dick, voice solemn necromancer himself, "for I mesmerist, I clairvoyant great power." The conjurer started. "Where?" "Here." He held his hand young Jack led forward. Harkaway Jefferson stared again. "Hullo!" ejaculated old Jack; "what deuce madcap Dick now?" "Cannot hazard guess," said Jefferson. "Mesmerism read future art does," said necromancer. "It can," said Dick; "it corroborates said. I will give proof friends here." And then, he could object, Dick made mesmeric pass two across young Jack's face, immediately appeared take effect. Young Jack's eyes closed, moment played his mouth merry smile mischief, he appeared state coma. Never mesmerism effected little trouble. "Now tell me," said Dick, tricks manner professional mesmerist, "tell person alludes?" "He speaks Mathias, brigand chief." "True," said Dick; "and Mathias escape?" "No." "You hear," said Dick, turning towards necromancer. "I do." "And therefore useless try effect liberation Mathias?" "Quite," returned young Jack. "The wizard trying he himself, he discovered police thrown prison." "Hah!" exclaimed Dick, "do hear that?" "I do," returned necromancer, "but false." "It true," said Dick. "So beware." [Illustration: 'SPEAK,' SAID DICK, MAKING MESMERIC PASSES ACROSS JACK'S FACE"--ADV. IN GREECE, VOL. II PAGE 64.] "Ask more," said wizard, eagerly. "Ask more." "What shall I ask?" demanded Dick. "Ask him--yet, mark me, I do not believe word it--ask him, curiosity, follows." "Follows what?" "What he said last." "You mean follows thrown prison?" he said, deliberately. "Yes." "Do hear?" said Dick. "Yes, master," responded young Jack. "Speak, then." By time Harkaway elder Jefferson began course see driving at, became much interested wizard young Jack going say. "What follows," said young Jack, "is dreadful look at." "Speak," said Dick, furious pass across lad's face. "Speak, I command you. What follows?" "I see wizard hanging neck--there," young Jack pointed straight him. The necromancer looked unhappy possible he heard young Jack's words. "Do know enough," asked Dick Harvey, "or would learn yet?" The wizard essayed smile, sickly attempt, died away ghastly manner. "I believe word say, still let speak on." Dick frowned. "If scoffer," he said, sternly, "my clairvoyant speak." "I scoffer," returned necromancer; "speak on." "What would know?" "When danger begin? Let say that." "Speak," said Dick, making mesmeric passes across Jack's face. "He need fear nothing present," said young Jack. The wizard drew long breath relief. "The police below," continued young Jack, "but ten minutes danger." "Ten minutes!" "Yes." "And after?" gasped wizard, breathlessly. "Then he doomed," said young Jack, sepulchral tones. "The wizard numbered dead." Thereupon, necromancer taken suddenly queer, he retreated confused words excuse. "He is gone," said Dick, laughing. They pushed aside curtains magician disappeared, found back staircase. "There he goes, he goes!" cried Harry Girdwood, excitedly. "Yes, he left his skin," said young Jack. Upon stairs long black velvet robe covered tin-foil ornaments, necromancer will not frighten ignorant superstitious peasants came consult wits. "I will frighten old Mole this," said young Jack. "I do not suppose they will try frighten us helping Mathias, brigand chief, prison," said Harkaway, laughing. "He shall hang high Haman," said Jefferson, sternly. "Of I determined, one else, I would willingly fix noose myself. But hang he shall murdering poor noble friend Brand." CHAPTER X. THE CONDEMNED CELL--MATHIAS ESCAPED--WHERE HAS HE GONE?--THE BLOOD ON THE HEARTH--A TALE OF TERROR. The schemes set foot friends Mathias his release many unceasing greatest precautions taken keep safety. Rules made, awhile rigidly enforced, soul permitted visit prisoner; exception proves rule, exception made favour lady came pleaded earnestly governor prison he could find courage refuse her. The lady shown cell Mathias lately occupied. Lately? Yes. The bird flown. But he got free? Where he gone? Not soul prison vaguest notion. The gaoler stared gaped like one dream. "Where Mathias?" demanded woman. "That is I guess," responded gaoler, rubbing his eyes though he could believe evidence. "Have mistaken cell?" "Not I." "Has he removed?" "No." She stared straight face moment two, she burst fit laughter. "Ha, ha, ha! Why, he escaped. He escaped. He beaten vigilance--baffled spite locks, bolts bars, watching." The gaoler scratched his head. "Let us look." "Look! why, see everything glance--everything. There four walls. There bedstead; see it. There room man creep there. There fireplace, window." "Ha!" ejaculated gaoler, "the window." "What then?" "There way; he must escaped way, undoubtedly." "Nonsense," said woman; "do not see high ground." "He found way climb there, then." "But iron bars places still." "True," said gaoler, thoroughly puzzled, "true. Where he got to?" "It simple enough." "How so?" "He never attempted window. He walked door left open." "Never!" "Money that, I rejoice his freedom." She moved door. But gaoler held her back rather roughly. "Stop here," he said, rudely; "I shall report governor, better remain job investigated." And startled woman could divine his intention, he swung door shot bolt. Then pushing back trap door, he added words grating. "You will safer there," said he, "unless manage get Mathias did. But devil must compact Mathias!" "At least leave light," she said, imploringly. "Against orders," answer vouchsafed. The trap shut. The woman left prisoner, total darkness. * * * * * There always something unpleasant darkness, woman means iron-nerved. No sooner she alone, painful sensation uneasiness stole her. "They keep long here," she kept murmuring herself; "I done nothing; I accused offence. The governor set liberty soon he knows. Could thing unfortunate? Mathias prisoner, I liberty. Now Mathias free, I prisoner. Cruel fate separate us. We destined parted." The gloom grew oppressive now. She stood still, listening painful silence five minutes together--five minutes appeared many hours. A silence solemn, death-like, she could hear beating her heart. This grew unbearable. She groped her way around cell find bed, approaching fireplace, she suddenly startled sound. A faint noise, something dripping flagstones her feet. In tomb-like silence reigning, faintest sound caused her feel uncomfortable. She listened awhile intently, asking herself could mean. Drip, drip, drip. It strange. When light there, she noticed all. What could then, heard dark? Was fancy? No. It real. There mistaking it. If oppressive gloom cell started strange sounds strange fancies her head, take shape that? Why, indeed? "Would Heaven back light," she said. "Will never come?" Just then, though her earnest wish heard answered, faint thin streak light shot cell grated window above. This reflected chamber prison whose window close window cell, lamp lighted. The welcome ray shot straight across cell she stood fireplace, she remarked dripping cease. Drip, drip, drip! She looked down. "I see, I see," she shudderingly exclaimed, "it raining, rain falling chimney. How foolish get alarmed nothing." Now light, said, shot across hearth, drip, drip, drip, fell. "Same I thought." As she muttered herself, she stretched forth her hand chimney, next drop fell upon it. It water. No, imperfect light then, sufficed show her upon her hand curiously dark stain. Raising nearer her eyes, she examined eagerly. Then she shuddered, exclaimed voice terror--"Blood!" Yes, blood. Pen describe terror wretched woman upon making alarming discovery. "Blood! Whose? Hah! whose blood? Whose his--whose blood darling--my Mathias?" For moment thought completely unnerved her, little short miracle she kept fainting. But she fought bravely deathly horror stealing her. And kneeling hearth, she called up, yet gentle voice, lest she give alarm-- "Mathias! Mathias, own! Do know me? Mathias, I say!" She listened--listened eagerly reply. And presently came--a dull, hollow moan, cry anguish chilled blood her heart, froze marrow her bones. "Mathias, darling Mathias! answer love mercy; I shall die else." Another moan heard. Fainter fainter even first. Yet full pent-up suffering. A sound told whole tale anguish. "Mathias, come me," she called again. "Oh-h-h!" A fearfully prolonged groan came her, louder before, sufferer put his remaining strength effort. Then silent. Eagerly she listened, straining forward catch faintest breath. But voice stilled ever. And yet drip, drip, drip continued, she stretched forward beneath chimney, she caught drops upon her face. Then she could longer thrust back conviction. With wild cry terror she drew back, groped her way round room towards door. Her hand rested upon grated trap, she pushed back her force, crying aloud help she so. "Help, help!" she shouted energy despair; "Mathias dying." But wretched man would trouble authorities more--His last breath drawn she stood listening awesome sounds. What could solution mystery! This would known soon now, sounds footsteps distinctly heard long stone corridors prison. The gaolers given alarm prisoner's escape, outlets prison guarded directions, party sent cell investigate matter thoroughly. At head party governor himself. The time appeared ten times long unhappy woman reality. "Help, help! oh, help!" she cried. At effort she grew weaker weaker. Her voice died away, reached door cell, found her hanging bars grated window trap dead alive. "Show light," ejaculated governor. And then, rays fell upon face, pallid flesh corpse, save dark blood stains settled, involuntary exclamation horror beholders. "Father mercy," cried one men; "she destroyed herself." Such general idea. She committed suicide. In this, however, speedily undeceived. To burst open door rush cell work moment. At woman rallied little recovered herself. "What matter?" asked governor. "The chimney!" gasped woman faintly. "The chimney! Speak--explain." "His blood--Mathias's," she said; "see chimney. I dare look." Two men approached chimney, lowering light carried, one discovered dark ominous pool upon hearth. "Call doctor; something meets eye this." This order promptly obeyed, surgeon speedily attendance. A mere cursory glance convinced man skill blood upon woman's face her own, he arrived decision, drip, drip, drip began upon hearth. The men looked half scared, governor scarcely self-possessed. The surgeon alone retained his presence mind. Snatching lamp one men, he thrust far his arm could reach chimney looked earnestly up. "As I thought!" he exclaimed. "What?" demanded governor, eagerly. "He there." "Who?" "Who prisoner? Mathias there--hopelessly stuck--wedged in. He trying escape hurt himself." The woman looked words. "Is worse?" she asked. "Is he badly hurt?" "I say yet," said surgeon; "we must get first." This proved difficult matter indeed. The flue narrow sheer madness attempt climbing it. Eagerly Mathias pushed on, finally got wedged inextricably. He could neither move down. It he made alarming discovery his struggles became desperate, his wild efforts free his self-set trap, he tore mutilated his flesh cruelly. The wounds want air done work. An hour's hard work succeeded setting prisoner free--or rather his body, found life extinct, according surgeon's report, entered cell. And came examine clothes, made discovery threw light upon whole affair. A small scrap paper, dirty crumpled found his pocket, upon writing great difficulty construed wise-- "The hope waterside. If reach roof, courage make plunge, freedom reward." How note came never discovered. With dire catastrophe ended efforts brigands free unhappy leader. CHAPTER XI. MR. MOLE VISITS THE WIZARD--THE MAGIC MIRROR AND THE LIFE-LIKE VISION--THE INCANTATION--THE CHARMED WIG. "In point fact, sir," said young Jack his tutor one morning, "it thing worth seeing here." "What is, Jack?" "The wizard." Mr. Mole looked straight his pupil upon this. "What wizard, sir?" he said, severely. "What mean?" "I mean conjuror Mr. Jefferson, dad, Uncle Dick went see." "When?" "The day. Did not tell it?" "No, sir." When Mr. Mole addressed his pupil "sir," young Jack knew pretty well he thought he humbugged. There old saying--"Jack good his master." Putting look injured innocence, he called his comrade Harry corroborate he said. "That is quite true, Mr. Mole." "That Mr. Jefferson went Mr. Harkaway Harvey see necromancer?" "Yes." "Preposterous!" quoth Mr. Mole. "Why, whatever world coming next? We shall spirit-rapping table-turning such-like muck, I suppose." Jack looked serious. "Then do not believe necromancy--that tell past future aid astrology?" "Pickles!" It would astonished Messieurs Crosse Blackwell themselves, could heard deal one word could convey uttered Isaac Mole. "Well, sir," said Harry Girdwood, seriously, "the wizard told us remarkable things indeed." "What he tell you?" "Many things, many wonderful things; one wonderful you, sir." Mr. Mole started. "Do not try come old soldier me," said Mole. Harry Girdwood protested he held Mr. Mole far much respect essay thing like coming ancient military, indeed anything else might construed want proper feeling. Mr. Mole looked hard him. "And he say me?" "He said intelligence party centred one person." "Well?" "And initials person question I. M." "Now, Jack." "Sir." "You two boys conspiring me." "You rather hard upon us, sir," said Harry Girdwood, injured look. "Was I? Dear me, I did not mean that," said poor Mole. "But I will go see wizard, call him." "It might startle you, sir." "Stuff nonsense, Harry; nerves iron--iron, I tell you." "They need steel, really mean go." "I will go, shall go me, Harry," said Mr. Mole; "and I will unmask wretched impostor you." And came his clenched fist upon table, fierceness energy made things leap up. * * * * * The chamber mystery arranged keen eye effect. The present possessors place preserved adjuncts looked effective career necromancer, fled ignominiously. A huge stuffed alligator swung ceiling, lighting room effected means two three swinging lamps, burnt dimly blue, made place look sepulchral enough satisfy morbid cravings horrible. At end room "charmed circle," drawn chalk, set around row hideous grinning skulls, suggested hint borrowed Zamiel, "Der Freyschutz." Besides matters, several skeletons stuck alarming attitudes. Beside chair large oval frame. Upon side necromancer's chair heavy curtain, _portière_ cloth, covered fantastic figures, drawn aside minute Mr. Mole Harry Girdwood appeared. Then, dark aperture thus disclosed, wizard hobbled in. Not wizard seen before, little old man bent half double age, little seen save long white beard appropriate robe. He leant heavily upon staff, sank his chair evident pain difficulty. "What would ye me?" said necromancer, feeble, querulous tones. "If ye come scoff again, begone ere I summon evil spirit blight ye." Mr. Mole said nothing. But Harry Girdwood placed his hand nervously upon old gentleman's arm, protection, he felt he trembling slightly. "He knows English, see," whispered Harry. "Ye-es--ahem!--ye-es." "Do hear me?" said wizard. "Ye-es, oh, yes, sir," said Mr. Mole, could not, life him, get his voice whisper. "Then answer." "By means! decidedly--quite so, I assure you." "What? Beware! Do mean doubt mock?" "Oh, dear; yes." "Hah!" "That is, no. I really do not know I saying." "Silence, fiends ber-lud ber-lud--Do hear me?" shrieked old wizard. "Quite so. Dear, dear me, Harry," said Mr. Mole undertone, "what remarkable person, I do not want lose ber-lud." "What say now, sir? Do feel sure he humbug?" "Of course not, but--" At juncture conversation cut short low, rumbling noise, sounded like distant thunder. As continued, increased strength, became absolutely deafening. Then suddenly upon sign necromancer, ceased, man mystery arose pointed menacingly his wand Mole. "Ye thought well neglect warning," he said, voice thrilled poor Mole strangely; "the secrets inmost heart known familiar, penalty must enacted." Mole bounced up. "Goodness me!" Harry Girdwood laid trembling hand upon unhappy old gentleman, played part Job's comforter considerable effect. "We lost." "Do not, Harry, do not! Pray consider Mrs. Mole two babes." "Try melt humble apology." "I will, I do!" exclaimed Mr. Mole great excitement. "I really mean it, Mr. Conjuror; 'pon soul, I not; pray let vampires take her-lud." "Enough," said wizard, sternly; "for ignorance shall excuse you. Now say would begone." "I think I like go," Mole whispered Harry, "What for?" "We long here," said Mr. Mole tone; "Mrs. M, looking me." "Perhaps do not feel quite comfortable here." "Comfortable," said Mr. Mole sickly smile; "oh, dear me, yes, I never jollier." "A little nervous perhaps, sir." "My dear boy," said Mole, positively, "I nerves iron, literally iron. Ha! noise that?" "Only magician's evil spirit, his familiar, he calls it." "Strange," said Mole; "but sheer humbug course." "Humbug?" "Hush!" exclaimed Mr. Mole, anxiously. Bang went deafening thunder again, Mr. Mole hopped towards door. Harry Girdwood followed closely up. "You uncomfortable, Mr. Mole." "Not all; nerves adamant, Harry." The latter laughed. Never audacious humbug Isaac Mole. "You see frame, sir, beside wizard's chair?" said Girdwood. "Yes," replied Mr. Mole; "what it?" "He showed us marvels last time." "What it?" "A magic mirror." "You must thoroughly well cheated; now, could he shown there?" "Wonders," replied Harry impressively; "you, amongst marvels." "Me?" "Yes." "What mean?" "I mean, sir, appeared us plainly I see now." Mr. Mole certainly looked serious this. "He show anyone may want see," said Harry. "Never!" "Try him." "I will," said Mr. Mole, show determination, shaking over. "Now, O sceptic, proof lore would ye have? Would ye know something yourself?" "No." "Yes," said Harry Girdwood promptly. The wizard inclined his head gravely, opened large volume upon table. After poring time, he said following doggrel deep bass voice-- "The doom Mole understood, For ever walk wood; Though upon macadam stone Yet he shall walk wood alone. "Let march asphalte--tile, In orange groves his thoughts beguile; Where'er he be, fate Mole's To scud life upon bare poles" This peculiar incantation effect somewhat increased soft music. "Ahem!" said Mr. Mole, "it did not want wizard tell that." "What, sir?" demanded Harry, innocently. "About wooden legs; infirmity visible every body." "But could he know?" "By looking." "Still sceptical," said wizard, sharp ears; "shall I consult book again?" "No, no," said Mr. Mole, uneasily. But Harry Girdwood said "Yes." He want end scene yet. "What would you?" demanded magician sternly. Harry commenced whisper Mr. Mole. "Come, sir, pluck courage, find something yourself. You know past--why ask future?" "He might rude enough say something unpleasant, Harry. However, I will try him." Then, polite bow, Mr. Mole asked-- "Can tell me, Mr. Magician, ultimate fate is?" The necromancer took two steps forward seized Mr. Mole's hand. "I find line life tinged hue blood," said he, solemn tones, lengthened inspection palm. "Dear me, unpleasant--I washed hands long ago." "Man! think wash away decrees fate sponge solemn words written stars? You Englishman?" "Certainly." "Already six Englishman sought me, six died terrible death. What says book?-- "A terrible death green earth, With never slightest chance heaven; Let curse day--the hour his birth, The English victim numbered seven." "And _Number Seven,_ Mr. Mole. May powers heaven earth preserve terrible doom yours." Mr. Mole almost fainted magician uttered fearful words respecting his (Mole's) fate. Harry Girdwood, however, handed rum flask, good pull restored his nerves. "Pooh!" said he, "I do not believe word he uttered." "Still sceptical?" said magician. "But convince power, I show thing like magic mirror." "Very well, then, I like see Harkaway Harvey present moment--just ascertain doing--that test." He chuckled he said this. But he spoke magic mirror grew light, two figures seen, set, were, frame. Jack Harkaway elder, seated arm-chair reading; beside stood his constant companion, Dick Harvey. The latter's figure remarkable two, attitude merely characteristic, startlingly like life. One hand his pocket; his face, thumb pointing his nose, fingers outstretched towards audience. "What think that?" asked Harry Girdwood, low tones. "Marvellous!" cried Mole; "that Harkaway Harvey, sure enough. Harvey got something matter his nose." "No," whispered Harry, "he is taking sight you." "So he is. Just like Harvey. Harvey!" he called out. The mirror darkened, figures faded away sight upon instant. "Do desire still another proof skill?" asked wizard. "Well can, like, tell something myself; do not put trouble." The wizard leant his book earnestly consider able time. "I see here," said he, "that contrived keep one important matter secret friends." "What?" "The hairs head numbered," continued wizard. Mr. Mole changed colour. "How--what?" "By barber; wear wig." "Oh, no--no!" exclaimed Harry Girdwood, positively, "You wrong there, sir, I assure you. Is he not, Mr. Mole?" "Of course he is." "Will see yourself, unbelieving boy?" "Yes," said Harry. "Where--say, shall familiar take it?" "Up ceiling." Mr. Mole groaned. At self-same instant went lights; heavy hand placed upon Mr. Mole's head, hey, presto! his wig seen dancing ceiling, glittering phosphorescent light upon it. Mr. Mole looked up, gave one awful yell, made door, flew away fast his wooden legs would carry him. And his yells continued, along his route young Jack sprinkled plentiful supply crackers, exploded he ran. An unearthly chorus, sounding like discordant laughter invisible fiends greeted his retreat, he never stopped he got home, panting gasping breath. As soon he room Harry Girdwood locked door. "Come forth, merry devils!" he shouted. "Old Mole's gone." The curtain drawn back, came Dick Harvey Jack Harkaway, carrying lights. The wizard threw back his head dress long horsehair wig, showed grinning face young Jack himself. "Bravo, Jack," said his comrade, Harry; "you ever much better conjuror did." "Was he frightened?" inquired young Jack. "Poor old Mole! I never saw alarmed before." Harvey old Jack enjoyed fun every bit much boys. "My opinion is," said elder Harkaway, laughing, "that triumph whole job dancing wig." "It beautifully done," said Harvey. "I nearly missed it," said Harry Girdwood laughing, "for put lights suddenly I could not find string, I nearly dug hook his head well his wig; phosphorus, I gave dab upon nose." "Ha, ha, ha!" Every thing carefully arranged beforehand, need hardly said, cord, fish-hook end it, run small wheel fixed ceiling. Harry held end cord, soon darkness confusion came, he drove hook poor old Mole's wig, he rubbed dexterously phosphorus, jerk he hauled ceiling, he set dancing about, indescribable horror Mole. CHAPTER XII. WHEREIN MR. MOLE IS CRUELLY USED--THE GARDEN FETE--SUNDAY AND MONDAY GIVE AN ENTERTAINMENT--ANOTHER LOOK INTO THE MAGIC MIRROR--STUDIES OF NATURAL HISTORY--AN INVOLUNTARY PERFORMER. When Isaac Mole time reflect coolly upon occurred, doubts arose his mind. In spite seemingly inexplicable nature phenomena he witnessed, he felt Harkaway, father son, must know something it. Dick Harvey, he morally sure, it. If thing fell, Harkaway would start up, Harvey young Jack would immediately inquire anxiously he startled, solely purpose leading Mole's words wizard's house. "Startled--nervous! Never; iron nerves, sir--adamant!" Upon occasions, Mr. Mole would glide away Harkaway's room without word, leaving his tormentors grin themselves. All could could make drop word allusion events narrated. On topic he utterly dumb. Day night worthy Isaac Mole brooded one solitary topic. Revenge. "I will teach  them," he said; "I will let know play practical jokes man like me." The last straw breaks camel's back. The last indignity his wig proved much Isaac Mole, he fatal day magician's, fondly hugging delusion secret his own. The talk tortured twisted make bear upon sorest subject poor old gentleman. "Dash wig, Mr. Mole!" Harvey would say; "let us take short country excursion. You know advantages change _hair."_ If suggestion wanting dinner day, voice ready advocate "jugged hare." "That is well," said Harkaway, "but get one parts?" "That is it," chimed Harvey; "as Mrs. Glasse says, first catch _hair,_ eh, Mr. Mole?" Mole winced. "It is always easy catch it, it, Mr. Mole?" said Harry Girdwood, slyly. "Not flies high," said young Jack. This chaff goaded poor old Mole fury, coming boys. "Really," he said, lofty sneer, "I do not see laugh idle nonsense children." This made grin ever. "The wit rising generation," sneered Mole. "Mr. Mole would like young generation never rise, I think," said Harry Girdwood. "That is it," laughed Harkaway; "Mr. Mole always conservative his ideas." "Let see, dad," said young Jack, looking puzzled; "Conservative, why, means Tory." "Yes." "But, Mr. Mole, I thought always Whig." Such storm laughter greeted sally, Mr. Mole could stand it. Looking daggers every body, he trudged room, digging his walking stick fiercely he went. Now door, he meet Sunday, grinning ear ear? "I am going fooled you, infernal black pudding," cried Mole, exasperated beyond measure. "Yah, yah," grinned mirthful Caesar Augustus, holding his sides. "Take that," cried Mole. Sunday take it. It pleasant dose, "that," instance, meant severe crack across head old Mole's walking stick. Sunday rubbed his poll. Happily thick wool garnished saved skull much danger, nigger's head proverbially tough. But yet Sunday relish indignity. "You dam wooden-legged ole tief," he shouted out; "I will gib yar dis hyar." And so, full revengeful thoughts, darkey sought his friend Monday. And set work plotting, result next day showed--much old gentleman's disgust. * * * * * They mustered good round dinner-party upon following day. In front summer house object excited Mr. Mole's curiosity considerably. One ladies asked for. "I do not know exactly is," replied Harkaway; "something Monday's, I think, Dick." "I believe so," replied Harvey, carelessly. "They going give us entertainment kind," said young Jack. The cloth cleared, Monday came forward, bowing gravely, addressed company. "Ladies gentlemen--" "Hear, hear!" Mole, who, thinking free attack, determined try bit chaff upon his account. "Thank you, sar," said Monday, bowing gracefully Mole. "Ladies gentlemen--" "Bravo, bravo!" shouted Mole; "exceedingly bravo." "Folks generally--sane insane"--here he bowed marked manner Mr. Mole. "Hear, hear!" cried Dick. "My entertainment a-gwine begin, scientific natur dat asks attention, I must ax go do not wish stay see through, interrupt me." "No one wishes go." The eager person remain Mr. Mole. Poor old Mole. Monday went on-- "The first I'se gwine show you, ladies gentlemen, speciminks known occult art, is, black art, magic." Mole winced. "Go on." "Hear, hear!" said Dick. "Bravo, Monday," Jack Harkaway. Mole silent. He another "bravo" him, speak. Monday bowed acknowledgment plaudits. "In first place, den, ladies gentlemen," he went say, "I mean show magic mirror." Mole glanced nervously Dick, Jack Harkaway. But looked stolid Dutchmen. Monday drew back curtain easel, disclosing frame, fitted plain black board. "In frame," said professor black art, "I show persons may ask for, dat is, persons known you." Mr. Mole heard enough convince he danger sacrificed insatiable passion his two old pupils chaffing practical joking. "Well, sar," said Monday, "just try um." "We will," said Dick. "Well, then, sar, shall first person I must bring you?" No reply. "Well, Mr. Mole, name somebody," said Monday, his insinuating manner. Mole's reply dissenting growl. "No." "Will you, Mr. Harkaway, sar?" he said. "Well, I like--suppose call upon friend, Sunday?" "Very good, sar." And he set work. A walking stick served wand, he waved three times slowly majestically, he repeated solemn tones singular legend-- "Hokus-pokus, popalorum, Stickstun, stickstun, cockalorum jig." Thereupon curtain went back, lo! Sunday appeared sitting upon throne state, robed long crimson mantle, made look like emperor. It dignified tableau, would been, long clay pipe darkey held his mouth pewter pot he carried his hand. "Ladies gemmen," said Monday, "dat ole friend, dressed de Empyroar Charleymane." "Bravo, bravo!" Even Mr. Mole laughed. The curtain closed dignified historical representation. "Now," said Dick Harvey, "let us see live Stock." "Yes, yes," said young Jack; "show us Nero." "And Mike." Monday bowed. Then back went curtain, sat Nero, monkey, throne vacated emperor "Charleymane," his feet stood bold poodle Mike wagging his tail. Nero appeared understand required him, he sat motionless statue while, long peculiar nervous irritation monkeys appear subject attacked him, he began series spasmodic researches natural history his ribs. "Nero's making lost time," said young Jack; "look he getting work." Nero indeed scratching away furiously. "There is diligence," laughed young Jack; "now he is busy." And he broke following appropriate snatch-- "He will catch flee--he will catch flee-- He will catch fleeting hour." Down went curtain. There general laugh this. "When asked show us live stock," said Dick Harvey, "you took us literally, Monday." "Yah, yah!" "You must learn draw line somewhere." Monday rapped ground his wand secure attention. Silence gained, he addressed thus-- "Before leave dis part de entertainment," he said, "I conclude de exhibition one animal. For reasons dat I need mention, I shall leave guess de name dis animal. It small animal dat lives wums." "Wums?" "Yes." "What they?" "On wums, scriggley wums insects, burrows earth." "Why, dear me," said young Jack, innocently, "that must mole." Before word could said, back went curtain, Nero discovered walking upon pair wooden stilts. He staggered like man liquor, made everyone yell quaint manner he hit Mr. Mole's movements. "Whatever he got his head?" said someone. Mole shivered. He guessed. Guessed; alas, he sure. Nero put his doubts rest making graceful bow removing his wig instead hat. The wig! Yea; identical wig Mr. Mole left behind his precipitate flight conjuror's. This much. Losing his dignity completely, Mr. Mole jumped burst group spectators, dashing place perfect fury, young Jack's voice ringing his ears he shouted-- "A wig! wig! My kingdom wig!" CHAPTER XIII. THE BRIGANDS' CAMP--A MOUNTAIN BIVOUAC--AN ALARM--THE SOLDIERS--A CHALLENGE--THE BRIGANDS' WIDOW--FATAL NEWS. We change scene. And find mountain pass, number rough-looking men grouped camp fire. A short distance group stands tall man, leaning moodily upon muzzle his musket, he watches zig-zag paths mountain side. Upon man one see whole safety party depends. He sentry. A prolonged silence suddenly broken sentinel looking grasping his musket nervously, he turned warning gesture camp. "What it?" exclaimed one party, jumping up. "Hush!" The sentry turned his finger his lips, motioned silence. At sign one men--evidently superior--the whole party sprang feet. A hurried examination musket-locks arms generally showed expected danger, waited word sentinel "up doing." The leader stepped sentry, drawn sword hand. "What it?" "The patrol." "Soldiers?" The sentry nodded. "The Carbonari?" "Yes." The leader grasped his sword nervously, made step forward though he would dashed ravine charge military alone unaided. But his intentions, he speedily altered his mind. "Perish them!" he muttered; "and curse spying!" "We could pick here," said one men--a huge, burly fellow, climbed projecting rock commanding extensive view. "All last man." And he spoke, he brought his gun his shoulder ominous gesture. "Hold, Toro!" ejaculated English voice. "Your hasty imprudence spoil us." "Bah!" said Toro, replying tongue. "You prudent, Hunston. Why destroy power?" "What one escapes?" "One not," retorted Italian savagely; "no, half one." "And good succeeded, say?" "Good!" reiterated Toro, passionately. "Are sworn foes? Are pursuit us? Good!--why, lessen number enemies number least?" "Yes, perhaps," replied Hunston. "And successful, would thoroughly alarm country, would whole army sent us, make end mere question time. Let one escape tell tale would bring spot, safest place mountains, hitherto undiscovered enemies." Toro grumbled. Yet much truth Hunston said he could urge nothing favour violent measures. The sentry, still watch fissure rocks, turned round motioned silence. "Not loud," he exclaimed, whisper; "they hear something; looking way." "Hah!" In fact, military near, could heard plainly enough giving words command. "Halt! Ground arms!" The rattle rifles heard distinctly. The officer could seen taking observations short telescope he carried suspended strap his side. He glanced place fixed little time upon fissures rocky passes, resting longer one sentry posted elsewhere. But although would seem aroused his suspicions, evident he could see nothing, for, minutes, he lowered his glass shut up. The reason was, sentry stood completely shadowed overhanging rocks, he invisible them, although could distinctly seen sentry. The scrutiny appeared satisfy officer. "Shoulder arms! Left wheel! March!" The measured tramp soldiers distinctly heard. Fainter fainter grew died away. The sentry watched silence several minutes he spoke. Presently he turned round his comrades nodded. "Safe," he said. "They turned crossroads; last man sight." "That is prime," said old friend Tomaso. "Then dinner." The sentry lost sight of--indeed, he man allow forgotten, meal long progress he reminded he thing appetite rough address. "Gluttons," he said party generally, "do think yourselves? Am I mount guard ever?" They laughed this. "Right, Ymeniz," said Toro; "turn turn fair. Matteo." "Present," returned one men, jumping saluting stiff military action, told he served army. "Relieve guard, let Ymeniz take place here." Matteo picked his musket marched rocky pass, late sentry joined feast. Now guard changed, without particular demonstration reluctance upon part new sentry himself, Tomaso made wry face. "Our comrade Toro gives his commands naturally though he leader." Toro flushed this. "And not?" he said, almost fiercely. "Why not?" echoed Tomaso, sneer. "Oh, I could give several reasons." "Give them." "Nay, one suffice." "Well." "Our chieftain gallant Mathias." "And he prison." "True; does not prove leader poor Mathias hands Philistines." "Bah!" replied Toro, impatiently. "Someone must command Mathias away." "Then others command his absence preference new comers." "Who they?" "You have not far look," returned Tomaso, drawing haughtily; "myself, instance." Toro burst loud derisive laugh. "You?" he said, contemptuously. "Yes, I." "Why, I led band gallant fellows years ago--a band thrice strength; aye, more, I led victory again--to victory fortune." "Your lucky star ascendant since deigned honour us company," said Tomaso. The covert sneer conveyed speech made peppery Italian fire up. "What mean that?" he demanded, fiercely. "I mean gallant followers must missed distinguished leader; pity could return lead fresh triumphs, greatly deplore loss." Toro boiled this. "Do want fix quarrel me?" he asked, voice suppressed passion. "No," replied Tomaso, insolently. "When I want quarrel, I go straight point; I do not beat bush. I want remind proper place fall back, Signor Italiano, learn respectful bearing." Stung quick this, Toro plucked his sword, would rushed upon other, several men interposed. "Come, come," said, "none that. We plenty enemies; cut throats, own, want spill blood." "Besides," said old man, "it profitless quarrelling leadership--we leader. Poor Mathias!" "Right," echoed several voices together, "right. Sit down; quarrelling." "Here," exclaimed old brigand, "let us drink Mathias." "And his speedy return," added another. "Aye, aye, his speedy release." Horn goblets handed round filled ruddy wine skin, old brigand produced his mysterious larder. "To Mathias!" "To Mathias!" A ringing cheer heard, goblets drained dregs. * * * * * "Who goes there?" "A friend." "The word." "Mathias." "Advance, friend, give countersign." This challenge replied to, woman appeared narrow entrance mountain pass. Slowly she walked through, her head drooping her eyes fixed upon ground. They recognised her now. It wife chieftain, bold Mathias. "I scarcely knew you," said sentry, apologetically. She looked smiled strangely vacant manner. The said nothing. Her manner impressed ugly feelings. Instinctively felt fresh calamity happened them. In fear trembling anticipated evil tidings she brought, although, course, could guess exact nature. "Did succeed!" demanded old man. She nodded gravely. "You saw Mathias?" "Yes." Her answer given vacant manner, staring fixedly midst them, she appeared see nothing. "Did tell brave captain eagerly look forward his release--how anxiously long moment he shall amongst us--at head?" It old brigand spoke. She gave strange look, could gather absolutely nothing, her eyes dropped ground. The heavy, unpleasant feeling deepened. Scarcely one courage address her again. An oppressive silence fell upon all. They looked silent, awkward expectation, all, bold desperadoes were, cowed silence her manner. "You succeeded seeing him?" said Hunston. "Yes," she said, quietly. "And bade good heart?--you told making plan his behalf--a plan could fail success? You said--" The woman looked up. "Nothing!" "What!" "Nothing," she slowly repeated, "nothing. I saw him, late speak words comfort." "Too late?" iterated Hunston, eagerly, "too late?" "Ah, late words comfort, menaces, thing." "Surely mean--" He could complete sentence, she helped out-- "I do," she said, hollow voice, nodding her head gravely, "I mean he, Mathias, brigand chief dead!" The brigands, one all, leaped feet, snatching carbines, throats issued deep cry revenge. Dead! The word thrilled one horror. The bold Mathias dead! Prepared her manner dire Calamity, came upon like thunderclap. The awful calm manner chieftain's widow impressed she thrown her hands wild despair given way noisiest demonstrations woe. After minutes, one ventured break awesome silence. "How he die?" The brigand's wife turned her questioner shudder. "Ask nothing yet. I able speak present; give time conquer weakness." "If I ask, I may seek vengeance upon his destroyer," said Tomaso, speaker. Her eyes sparkled, colour rushed her pale cheek word. "Vengeance--aye, vengeance. Well spoken, bold Tomaso; vengeance something live for, all; vengeance we will too. We will glut it; feast vengeance we will have." "We will, will!" shouted brigands, though one single voice. "These English Americans shall die." "They shall!" "We will exterminate them, root branch." "Aye, aye." "Firstly, Harkaways shall fall, then--" "They die." "Does Mathias owe his death Harkaway's band?" demanded Hunston. "Was Harkaway prime mover disasters?" "Curse him!" "Aye, curse him!" Toro stepped forward centre circle brigands formed. "If Harkaway dealt with," he said, "I undertake lead triumph within three days." Cheers greeted speech Tomaso stepped forward. "If want leader," said he, "we elect one; need man elect himself." "Stand back," said Toro angrily. "Fall back yourself," retorted Tomaso, "and obey superior." "My superior? Ha, ha! He live here," ejaculated Toro fiercely. The old brigand stepped disputants interfered. "Why quarrel dead man's shoes his widow still sight?" Tomaso fell back rebuke, Toro, less thin-skinned, stuck boldly his text. "If I offer lead enemy," he said, "it solely interest generally, mine alone." "Oho!" "Aye, I prove it." "Do so." "I will." "Hear him," said Tomaso derisively: "hear general benefactor speak us all." Toro turned upon speaker savagely. "I speak presently," he said significantly, tapping his sword hilt. "You will find ready answer way," retorted Tomaso boldly, also tapping his sword. "I doubt not; meanwhile, I offer leader, several reasons: firstly, I know Harkaways well, fit cope never met them." Tomaso laughed. "I doubt that," he said; "why, showing, never gained signal successes them." "No, I start would begin; I armed experience, lack." "True, true," exclaimed several brigands. "That sounds fairly enough," replied Tomaso, "but ever met signal discomfiture I, one, small confidence leadership. I do not speak uphold myself; let leader chosen--let one wit, Italian, foreigner. Why Greek lead Greeks?" "Hurrah!" A general cheer greeted speech. "Tomaso! Tomaso!" cried; "Tomaso leader!" Toro's face flushed blood red. "Hearken me," he exclaimed, voice hoarse passion; "Mathias great leader, I felt shame serve him, I command bold brave band this, one far stronger point numbers, I elected command I shall withdraw altogether. Have not, choice; determination; I accept orders man here." "Go, then," said Tomaso; "leave us. You came unbidden, may depart please." A general silence succeeded speech. Toro's aid despised. His huge body his muscular arm gained consideration lawless men, literally revered brute strength. "Wait, wait," said brigand, stepping forward. "Let us hasty. Some Toro, Tomaso." "Well?" "Say on." "Let us put vote, let disputants pledge abide decision." "Good." "What says Toro?" "Agreed." "And I," returned Tomaso, promptly. "Hands up, then, Toro." Half hands uplifted counted over. "Now Tomaso." Up went hands side, came tell off, discovered brigands equally divided choice. "We cannot two leaders," said brigand Ymeniz. "No, no." "Then must neither, matter stands." "Unless one gives way." "No," ejaculated Italian, fiercely, "unless Tomaso likes decide sword us shall lead." "I am agreed that," retorted Tomaso, promptly. "Let us fight it, may best man win." "Agreed." "Hurrah, hurrah!" A ring formed, preparations made deadly encounter. As agreed choice weapons, coin thrown up, Toro won. Tomaso would chosen pistols, he excellent shot, gave superiority; whereas, although altogether unskilled fence, Toro's superior weight size gave great advantage sword. However, nothing fight. The combatants stripped waist, received his weapon his second. They long, heavy swords, cut thrust, like heavy cavalry carry, could one result. Death! There half measures weapons. "Now, then," exclaimed Italian, impatiently, "why dallying? On guard." "I ready," cried Tomaso, gripping his sword firmly. The swords met clash sent forth shower sparks, men recoiled force shock. Recovering quickly, however, went work real savage style, chopped away vicious earnestness. Now Tomaso, clear, could hold his battle wherein mere brute force best it, feeling disadvantage respect, he dodged his adversary nimbly Harlequin himself. Being quick-sighted, he saw sort blow coming ere fairly dealt, he shaped his defence. If desperate stroke, he jumped reach. If light one, he turned upon edge his weapon. In way he worked upon Toro extent Italian's temper got mastery him. Tomaso attacking closely Italian looked like losing battle. Toro bleeding dozen small flesh wounds. Tomaso was, moment, almost unscathed. Presently he grew bold, incautiously trusting within reach, Toro lunged sharply merest shave he escaped spitted Italian's long sword like lark skewer. As sword pierced waistband his nether garments. Tomaso stumbled, nearly lost his balance took his time parry next stroke, put equal smartness vigour. One blow, might brought elephant, sent Tomaso his knees. The stroke made notch Greek's weapon half inch deep. Had he caught blow upon flat his sword, would shivered atoms beyond doubt. Toro saw his chance. Nor he slow avail it. Quick thought, another blow fell, his grasp flew Greek's blade. He lay prostrate mercy his adversary. "Beg life," cried Toro, planting his heavy foot firmly upon his adversary's chest. "Never," "Then die!" He raised his sword. But he paused. Was action brave man take life defenceless foe? Well, thought romantic notions troubled Toro; simply spectators. These spectators, he knew, would judge harshly. He thirsted Tomaso's blood. Yet he dared indulge his brutal passion. Therefore, making virtue necessity, he lowered his sword, spurning his beaten adversary his foot, bade rise. "Then take life unasked," he said coarsely, "and future learn know respect superiors." Toro's speech received cheers brigands. CHAPTER XIV. THE NEW CAPTAIN--HUNSTON'S TROUBLE--THE ARM AND ITS LEGEND--HOW EMMERSON'S VENGEANCE WORKS STEALTHILY ON. "What say, men, now?" demanded huge Italian, he wiped his sword. "Huzza Toro!" "Have I fairly earned right take lead here?" "Yes, yes." "I want unanimous," he persisted. "We are." Toro fixed his eyes upon one two disappointed supporters Tomaso, uttered word since discomfiture champion, said especially-- "If object leader, let come forward speak up." There one two murmuring voices. "Look," cried giant Toro, "men all, still denies power, let step forward, sword shall prove right." This final. After manner Toro dealt friend Tomaso, encouraged provoke quarrel. And so, his daring audacity brute strength, Toro Italian raised leadership Greek brigands. None dared dispute his sway moment. Some difficulty swallow bitter pill, alternative unpleasant got it. * * * * * And Harkaway's enemy Hunston? Why he fallen background late? His sole thoughts engrossed fearful sufferings he subject. That dreadful arm--the legacy vengeance murdered Emmerson. Where evil baffled his skill discover. Slowly yet surely horrible piece mechanism eating away wearer's life. "It seems almost though subtle poison slowly injected body arm," thought Hunston, "and yet I work without it." Never vengeance terrible dead Robert Emmerson. The wonder Hunston lived it. His constitution must iron. The arm removed, infinite trouble suffering; then, considerable time, Hunston began experience faint sense relief. The sufferings slowly diminished. This convinced Hunston he correct supposing poison concealed mechanical arm. He laid bare much he could without permanently damaging it, pored hours stretch. To good? None. Now limb work common artificer. It work hand rare cunning. A master spirit invented it, mystery far deep penetrated common bungler. Hunston last tortured that, disguising himself, he one day left mountains, sought advice surgeon. "The man planned arm," said surgeon Hunston submitted examination, "must devoted lifetime manufacture perfecting mechanical limb." Hunston smiled. He knew well little time wretched man Emmerson gave thing like industrial pursuits. "What this?" asked surgeon, pointing flat arm, engraved legend almost obscured dark stain. Hunston changed colour fidgeted about. "I do not know." "There something written." "Yes, yes, I believe, obscured stain--a stain--" He peered closer arm yet, looked serious, turning Hunston, he said-- "Why, blood-stain." "No, no!" replied Hunston, hurriedly; "impossible. It be." "Impossible not," said surgeon, "blood is, nothing blood. Yet I see that, spite stain, reading clear enough." "Scarcely," said Hunston. "It is, though, English, I say, too." "Yes." "Cannot read it?" "No." "Strange. Yet English." "Yes." "Well, I English friends I show it, and--" Hunston broke impatiently this. "English here!" he exclaimed. "Where live?" "At villa--" "What, Harkaway family, mean?" "Yes." "And would take there?" "Why not? Mr. Harkaway clever man. He surrounded also clever people; curious old gentleman there, too, old gentleman great learning, he might enabled throw light upon secret, even closest scrutiny penetrate." Hunston listened end, without exercise certain amount self-control. "How old gentleman called--this clever, learned old gentleman?" "You seem say sneer, sir," said surgeon; "but may rely upon he great _savant_--a man great accomplishments--and warrior has--" "Who lost two legs!" "Yes. You know him?" "Slightly; his name Mole." "It is." "And would take arm people stare gape at. No, sir; I foolish enough seek conceal affliction world, aid wonderful arm I hitherto successful." The doctor bowed. "So I beg keep secret." "Rely upon it." Hunston showed his old cunning speech. Yet his inquiries, his researches, availed nothing. The work dead Robert Emmerson remained before, inscrutable mystery. It remained silent executor creator's vengeance. Slowly, yet surely fulfilling blood-stained legend steel arm. CHAPTER XV. HUNSTON AGAIN AT WORK-THE DANCING GARDEN--MARIETTA AND HER GOSSIP-GREAT NEWS--THE ARREST--WHAT CHARGE?--MURDER. Hunston's infirmity told many ways. He sunk mere nonentity band. Now he pleased left peace his great suffering; yet sooner he recover health spirits little his old interest revived, his interest old jealousies. He bitterly resented Toro's assumption command. "Let blustering bully fool impose upon he will," he said again; "he never could take in. It shall task show render real service band." Their programme suited Hunston well. What could better accorded his humour devotion time, thought, energies persecution--perhaps entire destruction, Harkaway family? It gone avowedly avenge death Mathias. Little cared Hunston dead brigand chief. Indeed, presence his widow midst, occasional mention his name, Hunston would, probability, forgotten he ever existed. As was, he made his especial task hang parts town Harkaways likely met. And never he appear twice dress. One evening, strolling dancing garden, he chanced come upon smart young lady, whose appearance attracted his attention once. "I know her well," he said himself, "though I seen her puzzle moment." The merry antics one dancers caused her laugh, he recognised sound her voice immediately. "Marietta!" Surely he soon forgotten her. Was upon occasion her memorable exploits gardens Contessa Maraviglia he last seen her--that night poor Magog Brand met his fate? As soon he recognised her, he made his mind escort her. So first (to assure excellence his disguise) catching cursory glance his shadow mirror, he crossed garden, stepping her side, he addressed her. "Do join dance, signorina?" he said. The waiting maid reply cocked her chin haughtily moved away. "You proud, Marietta, to-night," said Hunston. She turned upon hearing her name mentioned. "I know you, sir." "But see I know you, Marietta, more, ask master Mr. Harkaway Mrs. Harkaway friend Saville, I dare say would say thing bad him." Marietta curtseyed confusion. "I do not remember seeing villa, signor," she said, "so pray excuse me." "No excuses, pretty Marietta; I constant visitor, yet I seen you, face seen easily forgotten." Marietta, like true daughter Eve, object sort thing. And she fell trap he set her little pains. That is, she grew gossipy communicative. "And Master Jack come sometimes?" asked sham Mr. Saville. She shook her head. "Never." "Mamma would object, course," he said lightly; "this wicked place her good, mild, innocent boy come to." Marietta laughed good deal hearing young Jack spoken thus. "Neither young gentlemen innocent," she said; "but yet do not come here." "Possibly taste sort thing," suggested Hunston. Marietta shrugged her shoulders. "They forbidden go alone." "Why?" "I do not know--some fancy ladies. They think brigands always lurking about, ready drop upon boys." "Ha, ha, ha!" laughed Hunston; "a good joke." "Is not? Although I must tell reason fear, I twice come across the--" "Across who?" "The brigands." "Impossible." "It true." "The miscreants. Did steal thing?" "Well, few--a kisses." "Hum!" said Hunston, "that excusable. It sort pilfering I would willingly indulge myself." "I dare say," answered Marietta saucily, "but I discovered use weapons self-defence." "What weapons?" "These." She held her ten pretty little claws. A tiny hand mounted on, too. Hunston surveyed eye connoisseur, looked admiration he wished convey quite extravagantly enough vain woman understand his meaning. "Exquisite," he said. "It would flattery even scratched models." She laughed. He resumed. "And never go forth fear brigands?" "Never." "Their lives must wretched, confined house." "Aye, go sea." "To sea?" "Yes, sailing boat; two boys always fishing, sailing, not." Hunston pricked his ears tidings. "Yes, water allowed full liberty, brigands cats, according Signor Harvey, two animals fear water most." "Ha, ha, ha!" laughed Hunston, "very good indeed, I never knew brigands feared water." "So Signor Harvey says," replied Marietta. "Indeed he says bar soap bowl water would frighten brigand whole armoury firearms." This true. Brigands may look picturesque seen distance. At close quarters are, put mildly, objectionable. If hold soap water absolute fear, Dick Harvey said, least look upon vanities effeminacies unworthy desperadoes. * * * * * "So, so," muttered Hunston, he walked away, "I shall secure yet. For boys I get father Harvey. Hah!" At precise moment heavy hand placed upon his shoulder. There professional touch it, felt could never forgotten. Hunston felt clutch England, recollection likely last long he lived. He forgot he was, every thing, instinctively he faltered inquiry-- "On charge?" "Murder!" He knew voice. He need look round; voice one easily forgotten. It old friend Pike, English detective. "Yes, Hunston," replied officer coolly. "You giving lot trouble, question time patience, I knew. Come along; prisoner." CHAPTER XVI. A GREAT DANGER--OFF AND AWAY!--POOR PIKE. Hunston quailed. He lost. So suddenly--so unexpectedly come, he utterly powerless help himself. Had he wearing mechanical arm, he might able tackle wiry officer Pike. Bitterly he curse his unlucky fate. Recovering himself, however, slight degree, he endeavoured shake detective's hold. "Quiet, now, quiet, Master Hunston," said Pike, "or I shall try means tranquilising will not find agree you." "Show warrant outrage," said Hunston. "Outrage! Hoity, toity! that is good word." "I shall call police assistance attempt molest me," said Hunston, putting lofty air. This tickled Pike mightily. "Call police, you?" he said. "Well, I shall not, I flatter I do not want much assistance walk man you--even lopsided." Hunston turned savagely upon detective allusion his crippled state made attempt using his one arm upon him. But Pike was--to put vulgarly--all there. He dexterously dodged blow, whirling round secured hold upon Hunston's collar--that peculiar grip specialty men force. Hunston struggled desperately get free. In vain. Do he would, he found trotted along save strangulation. Not physically painful. Hunston overweening sense his importance dignity, run like paltry pickpocket crowd, galling his vanity beyond description. What could he do? He powerless. The wondering people stared singular exhibition, parted ranks Pike his prisoner came along, never offered interfere. Now, brief painful business, Hunston's thoughts ran right ahead present dilemma. He endeavoured realise possible consequences it. The arrest was, he felt assured, illegal. What then? What could result proceeding? Would detain him? Could they?--that question. The British ambassador might influenced people rank position Harkaways. This granted, easy enough his excellency waive legal forms ceremonies there, get Hunston transferred safe keeping English authorities. At point Hunston could repress shudder. And why? He thought must necessarily follow. His fevered fancy flew ahead, he saw dock, faced stony-faced judge, put torture cross-examination laid bare innermost recesses his black heart spite himself. He saw yet. He shut his eyes he went heard tramp twelve jurors re-entering court midst profound awesome silence. He heard solemn formula; he heard hollow voice foreman give verdict-- "Guilty!" All he heard saw his mind's eye, brief unpleasant hustling he go hands ungenerous indefatigable officer Daniel Pike. And Hunston now, half cowed his captor, driven streets like lamb slaughter, sudden startling incident changed whole spirit scene, even twinkling eye. A musket, grasped strong hand barrel, swung heads, came awful crack upon poor Pike's head. Down he dropped like bullock butcher's pole-axe. And Hunston free. For seconds he could realise his release, sudden unexpected been. "Come along," said voice his ear; "away you, shall get trouble here." This aroused him. He recognised voice Tomaso brigand, brought his presence mind. Off he started good brisk run direction his preserver taken. And soon danger. But Tomaso fortunate. Following Hunston leisurely pace, he gone many yards, firm grip placed upon his shoulder. "Halt!" said voice. The brigand turned hastily, found firm clutch detective. "I caught last, villain!" exclaimed Pike detective, he twisted his hand collar garment Tomaso wore instead shirt. Then, astonished brigand time either remonstrate resist, Englishman exhibited particular form wrestling known "cross buttock," stretched full length ground. Another moment pair real Bow Street handcuffs snapped Tomaso's wrists. "Neatly done; do not think so?" said Pike. Tomaso's answer tremendous Greek oath. "You are swearing, I believe. Now bad habit times, foolish now, see do not hurt me, inasmuch I do not understand it," said Pike, who, brief, stern survey his captive, added-- "If cursed English, though, I do not know I might tempted punch ugly head." Tomaso remained silent, Pike, pausing seconds, helped his feet. "Now right, come back quietly me. But bracelets fit? I have got another pair pocket." "You better release me," observed Tomaso. "Now ridiculous, friend. Why I take trouble capturing you, I let run directly?" "It much disadvantage imprison me, Signor Englishman. An injured Greek always avenged way." "Just so; however, I will risk that" Pike's coolness added rage brigand, whose passion fairly boiled over. "May infernal gods forefathers worshipped--may fiend I--" "Serve," suggested Pike. "The fiend I would willingly serve, sell soul to, vengeance, visit his direst displeasure, may plagues Egypt blight you!" "Thank ye, that is pleasant speech; something like I used hear theatre. But, old friend, made one little blunder." "You see I blundered." "One little blunder, spoke selling soul. Lor' bless you, Old Scratch is not fool buy nowadays, whatever he may done years ago." Another angry exclamation Tomaso. "You see, old gentleman gained experience trader, he knows well enough he waits little time, he will get free-gratis nothing all." "You devil, Englishman." "And exactly angel. However, I devil, may consider regularly sold me. So come along; keep hands cloak, one notice little decorations wrists." "You devil, Signor Englishman; die this." "Pshaw! I have collared scores desperate villains, said something kind, yet I am." "You die," repeated Tomaso. "Some clay, course; proverb England; would like hear it?" Tomaso tossed his head lofty indifference. "The proverb," continued Pike, "is 'Threatened men live long.'" He took Tomaso arm, led on. "But stop," said he, "those pistols girdle heavy. I will carry you, knife well." CHAPTER XVII. THE DECOY--A THROW OF THE DICE--THE EXECUTION. Before Pike his captive gone far return journey, Harkaway Harvey, two three gendarmes, minute Jefferson, came up. "You caught then. Hurrah!" said Dick Harvey. "But Hunston," said Harkaway. "No, sir; he managed get clean away. But we will yet." An old goatherd, scrambled near place captor prisoner stood, might seen indulge contemptuous smile. We say might, fact much elated capture Tomaso presence old stranger hitherto remained unnoticed. Nor he seem court attention, remained behind bush, spot, however, he could hear passed. "Well, must take fellow back town, hand authorities," said Harvey. "And hunt Master Hunston," remarked old Jack. "I wish knew look him." "He took direction," remarked Pike. "True." "And, therefore, direction must look him." "Right again," remarked Dick Harvey. "But he associated desperate fellows, would well place gentleman hands authorities seek him. It good go action prisoners hands." As agreed point, walked back prisoner, pleasure seeing put cell which, apparently, way escape, even fire-place bricked since attempt Mathias gain freedom way. By time done late think starting day, friends retired hold council war. Pike, however, took part consultation. That astute detective formed his mind resolution that, possible, he would capture Hunston single-handed, thus covering glory, time keeping Harkaways Harvey danger. Pike knew difficult thing keep danger, heard thing brigands, would ones lead attack. Pike walked down, smoking reflecting difficulties surrounded his task. He thoroughly matured his plans sun went moon rose. Few people abroad. The audacity brigands recently displayed convinced people safer indoors out. As Pike walked quiet street, he noticed old man crouched corner, wrapped tattered cloak, apparently intending pass night there. "Hilloa, friend, you? Are one brigands?" Pike uttered words jocular manner, old man felt deeply offended. "Sir Englishman, insult me." "I apologise. I intention so." "A brigand! Signor, I here--houseless penniless old age accursed villains! May Sathanas fly away souls." "Well, old man, perchance avenged long." "It I pray for. They burnt hut, cut two fine olive trees, drove little flock goats." The old man covered his face, appeared sob violently. "When this?" asked Pike. "Scarce three hours since." "Was foreigner--one country?" "I know country of, besides Greeks, two men seemed leaders; one called Signor Toro, named Hunston." "How many all?" "Three Greeks besides two foreigners." "Do know thing haunts brigands, friend goatherd?" "Aye, well. But till I never dreamt betraying them, never molested me." "Lead den." "You, signer? Why, least five number, but--" "But Englishman! makes difference, friend goatherd, pray lead on. Here, take drink flask first." The old man accepted proffered drink, said-- "Well, signor, desperate dangerous undertaking; I know English almost thing, I show way. And comes fight, I shall elbow, signor." "True." Without mentioning his intentions, saying word his friends, detective passed his arm goatherd walked away. Little conversation passed. The detective full hopeful anxiety capture Hunston; goatherd, may presumed loss his goats afforded plenty food silent reflection. They passed place Tomaso captured, turned aside road dense wood covered side rocky hill. It appeared though old goatherd "out condition," athletes say; events, scramble rough path brought loud distressing cough. "Be quiet," said Pike; "you alarm them." "No fear that, signor; mile den villains." So scrambled climbed away, till length reached place Pike found necessary use hands well feet make progress. He put hands grasp boulder necessary climb, when, his intense astonishment, wrist grasped couple strong hands, another moment he forcibly dragged up. "The tables turned now, Mr. Pike," said voices "You remain prisoner till Tomaso released." It dark Pike could see speaker, he doubt Hunston. The impression confirmed instant goatherd, said jeering manner-- "Ha, ha, ha! Why do not capture him? You brave talk, yet nothing." Pike, sudden jerk, wrenched his captors, dealt mocking brigand--for he nothing more--a blow doubled among rocks. But detective could escape, he thrown himself, bound hand foot. Half-a-dozen Greek brigands raised bore away. How far he could tell, seemed, far he could guess, five six miles. At length reached little open glade forest least score brigands assembled. "You him, then?" said huge fellow, spoke Italian accent. "Yes." "Tie tree." It done. "Now listen," said Toro--for he given command. "If Tomaso liberty among us noon, shall die." "I set liberty." "You great deal towards it. Unfasten one his arms--his right arm." Pike's right arm released, and, obedience Toro's command, small table placed close him. On table pens, ink paper. "Now write friend Harkaway, tell unless Tomaso released noon, I told you, death doom." So Pike wrote-- "I hands brigands, unless Tomaso released noon, I shall killed. But I afraid die; hold captive fast." Having signed it, he held Toro, read it, called messenger, he entrusted delivery. Then brigands sat breakfast, Pike left his contemplations. These, may imagined, pleasant kind. Hour hour passed. The brigands sleeping, playing cards, enjoying way, one took notice prisoner. The sun rode high heavens, evidently approaching noon, messenger returned town letter. It addressed Pike, Toro opened it. It Harkaway, chief police, informing unfortunate detective Greek government declined make terms drive bargain brigands, ill usage Mr. Pike might suffer would effectually avenged. "You hear this?" said Toro. "I do." "Then say prayers remember, make peace Heaven, noon die." "Let executioner," said brigand stood by. "Not so," exclaimed another; "the task mine right." "Peace!" said Toro. "The dice shall decide his fate. The highest thrower shall pleasure shooting him." The brigands, obedience signal chief, gathered round him, short distance prisoner. Dice produced game began. "Double four," cried first thrower. "That man stands good chance executioner," thought Pike. "To fancy I, terror evil-doers England, sport dirty brigands. Why, I could well thrash half-a-dozen fair stand-up fight." At moment loud peal laughter greeted second dicer. "Ace--two." "My chance worthless," said man. "Worthless!" muttered Pike himself. "Aye, indeed worthless, compared English villains I hunted fought life death. I could die like man I die fair hand-to-hand fight man Birmingham Bill, first murderer I ever coped with; I will show Englishman die." "Double six!" shouted one brigands, he threw dice. The man smallest ugliest lot, seemed probable he would Pike's executioner. At events, he carefully loaded his carbine. "To shot villain that!" thought Pike. "It would better one shots fired burglar fellow call 'Whitechapel, Devil' taken effect; six times he fired, good ten minutes' tussle I could secure him." At length brigands thrown exception Toro. "Double six again!" As tie two, another throw. The little ugly brigand threw. "Two--three." Toro took dice, shook well box made his cast. "Five--four!" And Toro hailed winner. "Prisoner, I give two minutes prepare." "Brigand, I prepared. Such sins I committed, I repented of, worst; rest assured vengeance day overtake you. To Heaven I commend soul!" With much composure he practising inanimate target, Toro raised his gun, counted-- "One!" "Two!" "Three!" At word three, he pulled trigger. The report echoed rock rock, head body poor Pike fell forward, far ropes secured tree would permit. He dead, bullet penetrated brain. * * * * * That evening, Harkaway, Harvey, Jefferson returned unsuccessful attempt rouse authorities, found two men left heavy package house. On opening it, horrified find section hollow tree, nearly every portion wood crumbled away, leaving bark intact. And hollow body poor detective brief note. "The fate brigand hunters. Beware!--TORO." "Vengeance this, events," exclaimed Harkaway. "Poor Pike! We unworthy name Englishmen punish thy murderers." He wrote note mayor. "SIR,--In huge package accompanies note, find body Englishman, day murdered brigands; I call upon you, name Heaven, rout murderers dens, bring justice. Should show backwardness doing, I shall deem necessary appeal English ambassador. "Your obedient servant, "J. HARKAWAY." Having despatched couple messengers body letter, sat sorrowful hearts small appetites evening meal. CHAPTER XVIII. HUNSTON IN THE CAMP AGAIN--RETROSPECTION--A DEVILISH PLOT--DARK CLOUDS GATHER OVER THE HARKAWAYS. "Who goes there?" "A friend." "The word?" "Mathias." "Stand; advance step, I fire. Ha! I see now. I recognise voice, Hunston." "I thought not; precaution?" "Fear induced us change countersign. We believe mischief abroad, extra precautions needed." "Right, Ymeniz," said Hunston, scouting hours execution Pike, "although feared blindness prevents recognition friend comrade may mislead real character enemy, one dare penetrate thus far." The sentry laughed. "Fear nothing score, Hunston," he said. "Indeed I do." "My carefulness may turn even friends enemies, fear, carefulness--" "It much thing," suggested Hunston. "Right; likely make take foes friends." "I doubt it." "You cunning tongue, friend Hunston," said sentry, little bit nettled, "but I do not believe could prove satisfaction." "I might one other," returned Hunston, caustically; "but certainly both, two opposed." This dash subtle sentry, Hunston passed without remark. A steps he came group formed brigands, gathered around Pedro, brigand little assistance rescue Hunston, unlike Tomaso, managed escape. He recounting late adventures--from his episode tale--of Hunston. Hunston walked centre group. "Pedro," he said, "you rescued me, perhaps saved life; accept hand, eternal gratitude." Pedro stepped back. He winced instead taking proffered hand, his countenance fell. "Pardon Hunston," he said; "I am glad service you, able save comrade, but--" He paused. Hunston frowned. "But what?" "Do not grateful." The tone, less nature request, sounded little bit comical, made bystanders, Hunston included, smile. "What mean that, preserver? Why I grateful?" "Because I heard said gratitude brought bad luck anyone really befriended you." Hunston started. He thought Robert Emmerson. That arm inventor's work well, indeed. Not day passed Hunston realised truth legend inscribed mechanical arm. Not day passed, he saw fearfully legacy vengeance bequeathed murdered Protean Bob carried out. Dropping his glance confusion moment, he turned sharply upon brigand little reflection. Pedro could know nothing death Emmerson. Nay, probable name utterly unknown men. "You wish insult me, Pedro," he said, "and cancel obligation I you. But beware going far, may leave balance upon wrong side, I quick avenge insult to--" Pedro interrupted laugh. "What I say? I rendered great service--at least, say--" "And mean." "And mean, perhaps; yet already threatening me. When I said gratitude said bring bad luck anyone, I repeating idle saying--as I thought--but seems like truth, all." Hunston moving thoughtfully away, brigand's words stopped him. "Forgive me, Pedro," he said, turning round; "I bad, ungrateful man, I am utterly wanting decent feeling. You touch sore spot." So saying he walked on, leaving Pedro staring him. "That is queer lot," muttered brigand himself, "a queer lot. I think I would sooner murder priest conscience weighted deeds he will answer for." Pedro fool. His observations pretty well point. Hunston felt pangs remorse. Daily, hourly, fact, he looked back thought he was, he might his vicious propensities got upper hand critical turn his career. And demon remorse played havoc already. The mechanical arm responsible all. Its mysterious disorganisation direct his forced inactivity. What gives ugly thoughts power one bodily inactivity? Nothing. Robert Emmerson, vengeance terrible unceasing action. * * * * * Hunston sought widow Mathias. "I made good progress, Diana," he said, "for I learnt enough enemy make sure getting least power." The listener's eyes glistened words. "Are sure?" "Yes." "What propose do, then? Tell me." "Harkaway son--a mere youth." "I know it." "Well, boy dare-devil, bold fearless lad; nothing daunt him. He is, fact, his hated father first I knew him, years years ago." A faint half-suppressed sigh escaped he uttered this. "What boy?" "This boy companion called Harry Girdwood." "Well." "Well, two boys trapped, gone carefully--very carefully, mark you." "That done, course." "It can--by you." Diana stared this. "By me?" "Yes." "How?" "Listen. They pay certain respect us--hold us fear, fact--and boys, regular rovers, like parents friends, permission cruise little yacht." "How learn this?" "From Marietta, servant Harkaways." "Hah!" "Now, care, boys might lured, perhaps, away part coast know, let touch shore sight hearing friends--" "I see, I see," ejaculated widow Mathias. "I entrap them, I believe. But tell first, object securing two boys?" "The object!" ejaculated Hunston. "Why, surely clear enough. Let us get hold them, make terms like father friends. We shall dictate conditions, Harkaway choice accept them." "I see, I see," cried Diana, excitedly. "Leave rest me; I will undertake get power." "How?" "No matter how; done share business. Be mine task secure rest." "When?" "To-morrow." "Good!" said Hunston, gleefully, "good! I feel presentiment luck. I am superstitious, I feel certain shall succeed--as certain boys already power." "They shall be," returned woman, solemnly, "they shall be. I swear it!" CHAPTER XIX. JACK AND HARRY GIRDWOOD AFLOAT--THE SQUALL--THE SHIPWRECKED BOY--DEEDS OF HEROISM--THEIR REWARD--A DEADLY PERIL. "Down sail, Jack; shall sprightly," said Harry. Young Jack laughed. The thought danger actually made merry, proved he every inch Harkaway--a thorough chip old block. "There is fear, old fellow," he said. A sudden gust wind caught sail, caused boat give lurch moment boys sent flying. They got hard knocks. But neither afraid little rough usage, scrambled feet, laughing boisterously, great fun barked shins bruised arms. "I told so, Jack," said Harry Girdwood. "No harm done," retorted Jack, rubbing damaged part grinning. "No, do not let us foolish; might get trouble." Young Jack roared this. "Soho-ho!" he cried. "Shipped another passenger, Harry, you?" "What mean?" "Why, you have got Captain Funk aboard." "Not I," returned Harry, "only get foolish scrape, will not let us come sail again, jaunt left us, may well keep quiet." "There is something that," said young Jack, So saying, he set reefing sail possible despatch. Now barely accomplished violent gust wind drove little craft along furious rate. It time. A moment sail would shredded, or, still worse, boat would capsized certainty. Harry Girdwood lowered oars pulled sharply along fury gale, young Jack baled little water shipped first heavy lurch, youthful mariners fully prepared violent treatment, steered time. In way contrived elude violence gale present, least. But danger means overcome. They got worst trouble yet, little anticipated serious danger. The gale come strange suddenness, truth could hardly realize extent danger. It great. There was, perhaps, special providence ignorance real peril, coolness alone gave chance present emergency. They brave boys both--never braver--yet disparagement say great probability losing _sang froid_ known critical position actually was. As happened, best thing circumstances. They kept boat wind, vigorous rowing, contrived drive along rate literally tremendous. And scudded ten miles, wind dropped little, pace began tell upon both. "Keep her shore, Jack," cried Harry Girdwood. "Right." The wind rain half blinded young Jack, although he said "Right," he steered decidedly wrong. He could see going. "Look out!" Harry Girdwood spoke time young Jack take heed warning, minute later shot past sharp, jagged rocks, would inevitably dashed lucky tug rudder last moment. Now roar wind waters begun lull little, loud cry help heard. And then, first time, perceived boat launched boy thirty yards along beach, carried sea huge receding wave, become unmanageable. They could see half eye boy skill handling boat. "Help, help!" cried strange lad, waving his hand distress towards boat. "All right," shouted young Jack. "We are there." Harry Girdwood pulled vigorously towards venturesome youth. A strokes brought within twenty feet imperilled youth, he would got away safety his folly imprudence. "Sit still," shouted young Jack. "Sit still." "He will overboard," ejaculated Harry, glancing his shoulder. The words latter proved prophetic A cry young Jack--a piercing shriek boat. When Harry Girdwood glanced his shoulder again, he saw boat, keel upwards, floating away. The unfortunate youth, late occupant, nowhere seen. "He is gone!" "He has," cried young Jack, starting up, "and that is unlucky, he cannot swim. Pull on, pull hard. Pull mercy's sake." And young Jack stood boat, tearing his jacket waistcoat. "What after?" "I am him." "Jack, Jack, you will never live heavy sea." "Never fear, old boy, I will try." "You shall not, I say. You--" "Here goes," cried young Jack. And Harry Girdwood could interfere, he went, head first, boiling waves. Harry Girdwood held his breath sheer fright. He shipped his oars peered boat's side. Where he? Would he never come up? Oh, Heaven! fearful time seemed intrepid boy water. It seemed age. In reality minute, more, young Jack struck surface. He struck one hand--the grasped something. "Harry." "Yes, Jack." "I have got him." "Hold tight." "I mean to," responded young Jack, great coolness, things considered. And Harry could see Jack's left hand twined black flowing hair half senseless boy. The latter sooner reached air gulped breath two greedily, consciousness came partly back, he threw his arms his preserver struggled desperately. "Leave go," cried young Jack. "Let go, shall go together." But easy reason drowning man. Young Jack found desperate strait indeed. The frantic efforts rescued boy impeded his movements, entirely baffling heroic Jack's best efforts. Harry Girdwood saw all, his terror increased every moment. Well might. The mad struggles stranger imperilled both. "Dive, Jack, dive," cried Harry Girdwood, frantically; "dive him, you." Jack heard him. Twisting like eel embrace boy he would save, he dived down, dragging stranger him. In space seconds he reappeared upon surface, observing his former tactics. Striking his right arm, his left hand he grasped stranger's long black hair. "Catch hold him," gasped young Jack; "never mind me." Harry Girdwood leant boat's side caught stranger collar. "There; hold like that," said young Jack. The weight coming upon one side boat, however, threatened capsize it, act greatest precaution. Young Jack, however, struck swam round boat, his weight, clinging upon side boat, served steady Harry Girdwood completed rescue stranger. "Bravo!" cried young Jack. "It tough job," said Harry. "And narrow squeak us." "Right; let us look poor fellow. He is alive." "Yes." "I am glad that; would precious hard work, mention risk run, let slip his cable spite us." "Well, his fault he is alive now." "Alive." quoth young Jack, "by George! He looks dead alive is." "Do not fear him, Jack; he is good twenty dead men far, getting on?" "Hearty. Rather damp outside, nothing more." "And inside?" "Damp too. Why, I shipped bellyful salt water last drop down; enough salt barrel junk." Harry turned his attention stranger. "He keeps insensible long time," he said young Jack; "it begins look serious." "Move scat," said young Jack, "and let us lay flat upon his back bottom boat. I always heard proper thing do." No sooner said done. Presently rewarded pains detecting faint breathing. "How white his neck is," said Harry Girdwood. "And small delicate his hands," said young Jack. "One would almost take woman." "He would pass well one he wore petticoats." "I am almost inclined think that--" "Ha! He is coming round." The youth opened his eyes stared him. He looked half scared first one other. "You better now," said young Jack, taking his hand. He stared. Jack spoken English his anxiety. He put sentiment best Greek he could muster. "Yes, yes," replied stranger, "better, better," he appeared grow confused; "but this? Have I ill?" "Yes." "Ah!" "Not very; well now. Do not remember--" The rocking boat furnished missing link chain memory, rescued boy showed, ray intelligence his bright face, come back him. A smile grateful acknowledgment services shot his countenance. Then suddenly his expression changed. "Where going?" he demanded, extraordinary eagerness. "Ashore." "Oh, no, no, no!" he exclaimed; "not ashore here." "Why not?" "You must go ashore here," said youth, eagerly, "not worlds." "Why?" Jack questioning stranger Harry Girdwood shot boat favourable creek. Harry jumped out. "Come along," he said cheerfully. "Safe shore." "And precious glad it," added young Jack. The stranger looked upon anxious expectation, finding alone, he turned eagerly his young preservers. "Put again," he said; "put sea, I tell you." "Why?" "You disarmed me; saved life shown tenderness care--aye, brotherly love. Oh," he added earnestly, "pray go now; once, free." "Well," quoth young Jack, long whistle, "this rum go." Before another word could spoken, heard whistle, sounded like echo young Jack's note; answer came another direction, half-a-dozen men sprang forward one could see where, pounced upon two bold boys, Jack Harry Girdwood. "Bravo, Theodora!" cried familiar voice English, "you play part decoy perfection. We got last." Young Jack started. He turned pale haggard, looking moment Harry. "Do know voice?" "I do," replied Harry Girdwood. "We sold, undone. It villain Hunston." * * * * * It little young Jack Harry Girdwood entrapped, strange scene took place. Evening coming on. Brigand sentinels posted path haunt could approached, one perched high flat rock, overlooked everything, without seen except sharpest eyes. Hunston, visiting outposts seeing everything safe night, climbed spot, seated large stone. He felt feverish, elevation he might feel something breeze, thing unknown bivouac, closely surrounded thick bushes. Strange dreads doubts filled Hunston's mind, dread future, dread lingering illness his arm, daily grew worse, dread death, he felt convinced must end, doubts whether eventually his enemy Harkaway would triumph. For Hunston's hatred Harkaway knew abatement; living dying, fierce, unquenchable thirst vengeance would fill his soul. But troubled his health. The shoulder mechanical arm attached painful, could scarcely bear pressure clothing he wore; blood his veins, flowing part system, seemed return his heart heated almost boiling point, heat stimulate exertion. On contrary, he felt languid scarcely able duties devolved upon Toro's lieutenant. Nor his brain clear former days. Ideas he plenty, seemed jostle confuse endeavours settle connected train thought. Emmerson's vengeance working. As he sat there, sentinel remained motionless, leaning his carbine peering edge precipice. Presently Diana, widow Mathias, came rock, Hunston rose greet her. "Your husband certain extent avenged," said he. "How?" "Harkaway's boy power," "That something, events. That girl Theodora, niece Tomaso, done her work well. Vengeance commenced." "Yes, but--" "But what?" "There hitch proceedings. The girl softhearted, begged hard lives." "She fool! By Heaven, I half inclined deed dagger." "In case Toro would probably you." "What, he turned craven?" "No; he sweet Theodora, her sake inclined spare them." Hunston knew well enough false, as, unless certain conditions promptly complied with, Toro would certainly kill without slightest hesitation compunction. But he tell Diana. "But," he continued, "what idea vengeance?" "I would wring hearts mine wrung. I would blinding tears dim brightness eyes besides mine. I would stern judge Death pass decree divorce upon others besides Mathias. When Harkaway widower, his wife widow, I shall consider vengeance partly accomplished." "Humph! woman tolerably moderate. I shall satisfied till Harkaways Harveys destroyed root branch-till accursed detective, Nabley, his American friend Jefferson, negroes, wooden-legged ass Mole, till every one party swept away path. Harkaway taught hate, I swear eternal powers earth, heaven, hell, he shall see I profited lesson." Diana silent moments; then, something like sneer, said-- "You brave man--in words, Signor Hunston." "My acts speak themselves." "And little said time past. But listen; I sworn deep deadly revenge." "Well." "This evening I depart." "Good." "When I return again, may expect hear Harkaway dead his wife." The excited woman glided away, Hunston, smoking cigarette, followed her. "Good?" chuckled Hunston himself, "I could better ally woman; she go I dare show myself, find opportunities carrying her plans unsuspected. Beware, Harkaway! though I waited years revenge, within grasp." CHAPTER XX. THE HARKAWAYS LEARN ALL--MR. MOLE EXPLAINS AND GETS INTO TROUBLE IN CONSEQUENCE. Words cannot describe trouble Harkaway family loss young Jack his stout-hearted comrade, Harry Girdwood. At first indignation great, first impulse use violent means effect recovery boys. But first person oppose Jack Harkaway himself. "If attack force," he said, "it would imprudent upon every hand. In first place would advantage us, course, mountain skirmish." "I do not know would get best it," said Harvey. "Nor I," said Jefferson. "We nothing present far I see," said Harkaway. "Only wait." "To end?" "Their object must plunder--money--ransom." "Supposing demand sum?" "I shall pay soon ever I rake up. If I possess world," said Jack Harkaway, seriously, "then I shall borrow friends make up." The poor fellow turned away hide his emotion. "What guarantee would give boys ransom?" "None. But I send money first. They would send boys first." "They might doubt you." "Why, yes. But Hunston Toro them, know Jack Harkaway's word his bond, matter he dealing, let veriest scum face earth." "Which are." "Which are, say." "Very good," said Jefferson. "Now I do not want play part wet blanket, dash hopes ground half formed, I wish guard running away upon false track." "In way?" "All hopes ransoming boys rest upon fact Hunston Toro brigands." "Yes." "Well," added Jefferson, "how know Hunston Toro really band? You suppose that." "I answer positively that," said voice door. They turned. There stood Nabley, detective. "Nabley!" "Nabley here!" "Himself," said indefatigable officer, coming forward. "Hunston brigands, much them, fact." "That know," said Harkaway, related death Pike, supposed abduction young Jack. "I ill," said Nabley. "I fainted street, and, falling, severely injured head. But know Hunston finds doings?" "No." "Well, one household." "Explain," said Harkaway. "What mean?" asked Harvey. "I cannot talk much; Mr. Mole tell perhaps better. Here, Mr. Mole." Mr. Mole stepped forward, looking little sheepish. "Mr. Mole!" "Mr. Mole!" exclaimed dozen voices chorus. "Yes, friends," said old gentleman, stepping forward his well-known modesty, "it even so; much-wronged Mole." "Tell us occurred," said Harkaway. "I dancing garden, seated species small summer house, taking glass of--I mean cup tea--ahem!--when I fell asleep--I dozed, fact." "You would," said Harvey. "I have often noticed doze glass of--I mean cup tea." Mole glared speaker. "The heat day quite overcame me." "It would," said Dick, compassionate manner. "When I woke up, I heard two persons conversing close green arbour I sat." "Yes." "Two familiar voices." "Ha!" exclaimed Harkaway, eagerly. "Now guess," said Mole, "who two familiar voices belonged to?" "Cannot." "Out it." "One voices," said Mr. Mole, "was Hunston's, was--" "Toro's?" "No." "No! Whose then?" "Marietta's." "Marietta--what, maid here?" "Yes." "Impossible." "Was it, egad? I thought so, I easily mistaken." "Unless dreamt." "Bah!" exclaimed Mr. Mole, ineffable contempt; "fiddlesticks!" "But suppose she league Hunston?" demanded Emily great eagerness. "No." "What then?" "He bamboozling her, twisting her round his finger, one might say. He got casual chat, persuading her he private friend yours, he pumped pumped her boys, went, forth." "And she say thing could serve his vile purpose?" asked Mrs. Harkaway. "Plenty help them, miscreants, I suppose." "The girl must downright idiot get conversation strange man taken place, danger she knows ran." "Not far short it," said Jefferson. "He spoke particularly boys venturing mountains, permitted sail boat, and--" Harkaway broke exclamation startled all. "That explains all," he said. "All, all, I see now." "Do you? Explain." "They put sea taken boys, perhaps stealth, perhaps violence." "Likely enough." "Poor boys, poor boys!" "And take place?" demanded Jefferson; "in one public promenades, say?" "Mr. Jefferson," replied old Mole saucily, "you want nose filed. I said dancing garden." "Oh, de dancing garden, it, Massa Ikey?" said voice his ear, caused palpitate nervously. It Mrs. Mole. When he spoken dancing garden, he noticed his better half's presence. "Yes, dear," he said timidly, trying look dignified company. "And you--doing place dancing garding, Mister Mole, sar?" demanded his dusky rib, voice sounded dangerous. "I went, dear, study character," said Mr. Mole timidly.... "What?" thundered Mrs. Mole. He trembled, faltered something almost inaudibly. "Studyin' character," said lady great contempt; "losing character, silly old pump--" "My dear," remonstrated old gentleman. "Do not 'my dear' me," said Mrs. Mole; "you are gwine silly old cokernut, bald-headed old coon." "Mrs. Mole!" "You go dat dancin' garding see dem gals jump dance make fools ob demselves, ignorant critters." "No thing, I tell you," said Mole, indignantly. "Oh, yes, is," said his better half, "and you's bushel indelicate dan dey is, silly old possum." This started company generally noisy fit laughter, poor Mole forced beat retreat, followed his irate partner. "Poor Mole," said Jefferson, laughing heartily, "it unlucky admission him. Chloe give sorely this, I am afraid." * * * * * They went deeply question ransoming boys, convinced really fallen hands brigands. But would, say would, could come back one result. They must wait. Patience difficult circumstances, help it. "Wait till to-morrow," said Jefferson; "it hard job, I know, I feel certain boys brigands, to-morrow morning bring message them." "But nothing done meanwhile?" said Emily. "No." "Nothing." "Stay; may get papers printed circulated everywhere, offering heavy reward recovery boys." "To end?" "It harm, may good. At rate, show brigands ready pay piper boys' sake." "That is true," said Jefferson. "Let us it," said Harkaway, pacing impatiently; "at rate, thing better remaining inactive." CHAPTER XXI. A HOUSE OF MOURNING--THE LETTER FROM THE ENEMY--A STRANGE CORRESPONDENCE--THE INCIDENT AT THE OPEN WINDOW--HUNSTON'S REVENGE--DESPAIR. It Jefferson predicted. The notices printed circulated everywhere well-chosen energetic agents. Early next morning, letter found fastened garden gate. It brought Harkaway, already busy. He tore eagerly open, found following written disguised handwriting English-- "TO Mr. JOHN HARKAWAY: "If would save lives son _protégé_, his companion, way bring sum five hundred pounds sterling stone cross old well two of the clock afternoon. Those two boys keeping watch. Come along, value happiness safety." "Not likely," said Jack Harkaway. Instead complying shallow request, he wrote answer terms: "TO HUNSTON AND HIS FELLOW-VILLAINS: "Send lads back here. Within half-an-hour return, money shall sent will. This I promise, swear upon honour. None knows better may implicitly relied upon. "HARKAWAY." This letter he sent trusty messenger spot appointed meeting place, waited impatiently result. It long coming. Before two of the clock, Marietta discovered another letter tied garden gate, came unable decide. Be may, soon discovered highest importance present state affairs. It brief startling, ran follows-- "We bandy words you. We offer conditions. You refuse. Well good. The consequences upon head. If money paid four to-day, six boys lose ear each." "The villains!" cried poor Harkaway. "Oh, villains!" But he powerless help them. He knew well enough that, he would, he could hope get boys back without paying, paying nose too. Nor indeed he desire try achieve this. The question was, would deliver prisoners, received five hundred pounds? Perhaps. Perhaps not. If not, would much peril already. Nay, more. He guessed shrewdly enough received handsome sum five hundred pounds, would think drained dry, nearly possible arrive at, might make short work young Jack Harry Girdwood. What done? He could say. He would gladly risked he possessed world chance his boys back. Aye, his boys, Harry Girdwood second Harkaway's affection young Jack. But he wish reward miscreants ill-treating unfortunate lads. At length he came conclusion he would persist his resolve boys back he parted money all. Accordingly he wrote another note brigands. This he dispatched means former note. "Release two lads. Restore us, ransom king shall yours. Fix upon sum, however great, provided within means pay it, shall ask twice. Moreover, I shall nothing molest interfere way. Play false, harm hair boys' heads, beware. You may know Jack Harkaway man make enemy of." The answer long coming. An ugly scrawl upon dirty piece paper, small parcel. "We despise threats, laugh scorn. That may know little trifled with, send ears proof kept word. By hour to-morrow two boys die, unless pay sum fixed upon us, manner amount." Jack Harkaway turned faint sick. He dared open parcel accompanied letter. He sent Jefferson Harvey, unable trust speak, he placed letter latter's hands. "Read, read," he said, horror-stricken look. Harvey glanced letter, his countenance fell he passed Jefferson. "What done?" "I do not know," replied Jefferson; "I loss. This horrible." "What say, Dick?" Harvey hung his head. "Speak, Dick. Tell me, old, friend, I ought do," said Harkaway, imploringly. "I bewildered--dazed--at wits' end. What ought I do?" "Pay money." Accordingly money, gold, placed bag spot indicated first note addressed brigands Jack Harkaway. This done, awaited result. It soon came. Too soon latter's peace mind. As family friends seated moody silence sorrow around dinner-table, strong sense oppression upon everyone conversed whispers. "The heat really overpowering," said Mrs. Harkaway. "Shall I open window?" "If please." He hastened comply her request, instant something shot past room. It fell clatter upon table, cannoned dish Jack Harkaway, striking rather sharp blow chest. "What is that?" "Hullo!" "A stone." "Yes, stone paper wrapped round it." "So is." "A letter, I think," suggested Dick. "If so," said Harkaway, smiling sadly, "it evidently meant me." "You striking proof that," said Dick. Harkaway undid paper scanned through. His countenance fell he read on. His pale face grew pallid, rising his seat, he ran, rather staggered, window. "Gone!" "What matter?" demanded Dick, jumping up. "See man threw letter in," exclaimed Harkaway. "Come me--come, come immediately!" And somewhat wild exhortation, he tottered room, followed Dick. Everybody arose table confusion. Dismay, alarm, depicted every face. "What be?" ejaculated Mrs. Harkaway. "Oh, Mr. Jefferson, go see, bring news." "I will. Calm yourself, dear Mrs. Harkaway; likely good news thus agitates poor Jack." Away he went. "I fear reverse," said Emily, shaking her head. Jefferson overtook Harkaway Dick Harvey gardens, active search going forward man, individual either sex, could thrown stone strange letter. "Let see letter, Jack." The latter placed his hand, then, Jefferson's horror dismay, he found contained following words-- "TO HATED HARKAWAY. "I years years patience, turn come last. As eyes glance lines, boy vainly supplicating mercy. Before reach signature foot, accursed brat dead--mark that--dead! No power earth save him. Had sent money demanded his ransom promptly, could saved him. May knowledge wring heart wrung mine bygone years. "HUNSTON." CHAPTER XXII. A HOUSE OF MOURNING--HARVEY'S RESOLVE--A TIME OF TROUBLE. "Horrible!" cried Jefferson; "horrible!" Dismay terror every face. The dreadful news paralysed movements, rendered momentarily helpless. Dick Harvey first break silence. He sprang his feet, made grounds, motioning others follow him. "Let us try catch postman," he exclaimed; "if get hold him, may learn something worth knowing." "Bravo!" responded Jefferson; "a capital idea." They flying grounds immediately. But result may guessed advance. Not sign bearer alarming letter. They gave search faintest vestige hope left, crestfallen disappointed, returned house. "Come," said Dick bold American; "we must move; must stirring." "What for?" "For several reasons," replied Dick, "but firstly purpose giving Jack something do. It never let man his condition brood." They sought poor Harkaway again, led hold consultation. "Jack," said Harvey, brusquely, "you must give way despondency. I say positively, must not. You certainly undermine health." "Do fear me, Dick," returned Harkaway, "I shall better little quiet." "Indeed you will not. Besides, boys." Harkaway's lips quivered, big lump rose his throat. He swallowed considerable difficulty, silently wrung Dick's hand. "Do not, do not, old friend," he faltered, broken-hearted voice. "I cannot bear mention names. Poor boys! poor boys!" "But must," insisted Harvey. "I do not mean leave lurch." "What mean?" "What I say. We must give search." "Ah, Dick, would persuade me, cannot persuade yourself." "You wrong," replied Harvey. "I deepest conviction point." "To effect?" "That live--both live." Jack Harkaway looked positively frightened reply. "Dick, Dick," he exclaimed, mournfully, "what saying, old friend?" "What I mean. They yet live," returned Harvey boldly. "No, no." "But I say, yes, yes." "I rather say murdered long received last message." "Come, come, Jack," he said; "rouse yourself, man. Whatever make believe true?" "The letter." Dick laughed this. "That first thing raise doubts," replied Dick. "Why, known Hunston his life, never found thing notorious liar." "True; but--" "He told lies boy--lies youth--lies man. His life one long lie, yet choose make wretched us upon strength vagabond's word. Bah!" Harkaway hung his head sighed. "That all, Dick," he said; "I direst presentiment upon me--" "Presentiment!" ejaculated Dick, interrupting him. "Well, Jack, I quarrel presentiments, since I urged I say presentiments--only presentiments hopeful description." "Dick," said Harkaway, looking straight face, "you trying deceive me." "I swear I not," retorted Harvey, warmth. "And shall soon see whether I earnest." "What mean?" "I mean I going fetch boys." "What wildness talking, Dick? What this?" "Simply to-morrow daybreak I shall start search." "Whither?" "To mountains." Harkaway looked frightened this. "Not trust brigands' clutches?" "I mean beard tigers lair," echoed Dick firmly; "not word, Jack," he added, he saw Harkaway interrupt him, "not word; worthy Richard Harvey go, his spirit another skin go." "You never going trust disguise." "I am." "Why, Dick, old friend, unhappy man Protean Bob himself, Hunston would penetrate disguise; eye hate--" "Nonsense. If I Protean Bob, Hunston would glad recognise me." "Perhaps." "Now, Jack, must listen me, give advice. My determination taken; nothing shake it. Hilda family generally must suppose I gone port arrange departure, since appear thoroughly bent upon leaving here." "But never believe word it." "That I help, events I leave to-morrow, daybreak, may shade one victims aid throw dust eyes Hunston Italian villain Toro." "Amen," said Harkaway, seriously. * * * * * Surely enough, daybreak, someone set forth villa, although behind scenes give shrewd guess was, early wanderer looked unlike Dick could well imagine. Was indeed Dick? CHAPTER XXII. THE SILK DRESS--MURDER! The morning interview Hunston widow Mathias, woman missing camp. No one doubted she gone her errand vengeance, Hunston told Toro one two others her threats Harkaways; question she so? No one knew. The sentinels night long guarded known path leading bivouac questioned, neither seen her depart. Toro rather annoyed this; he great objection her slaughtering whole Harkaway family, although he certainly would prefer perform task himself. But he could help thinking secret path might admit foes, well permit exit friends. However, must leave Toro his reflections, follow brigand's widow. It one two morning she quitted bivouac without observed, walked slowly towards town Harkaways located. There occasion hurry. At hour morning she could hope gain admittance house her foes located. A day must pass, evening come again, thing could done. Diana's brain whirl. Deep-seated, poignant grief loss one she loved passion her impetuous nature capable of, made thought hope revenge grow stronger stronger. Vengeance! aye, terrible one her soul craved. Let deadly blow stricken, matter even she fell hands authorities? What matter even her life pronounced forfeit law? life little charm her. As sun rose, she sat little way road tried form connected plan carrying her purpose. But no! her brain confused deep thought, brief interval she resolved act upon plan whatever, simply course events might dictate. At hour she thought inhabitants town would begin stir, Diana walked place. She knew residence Harkaways well, scarcely glanced she passed proceeded little house far it, where, according inscription door, one might obtain food, drink lodging. Entering place, Diana made slender meal, then, telling ancient dame kept house she fatigued, demanded shown she could repose hour two. The old woman ushered her small, meanly-furnished apartment front house. "Do disturb me. I rest till noon later," said Diana. "You shall interrupted," response, Diana left alone. She tried sleep, she might stronger cooler business she hand; excitement she laboured effectually chased away drowsiness. A little noon woman house looked in, finding her lodger awake, entered conversation, commencing suggesting refreshment. Diana shook her head. "Ah, food plain humble," said old woman. "I cannot give dainties people yonder eat." She jerked her thumb direction Harkaway residence. "What people they?" asked Diana, assumed indifference she far feeling. "Some English." "Do they, then, eat drink best?" "The best; oh, rich." "What want here?" "They come destroy brigands; droll?" "Ha! succeeded?" "No; careful, brigands destroy them. They careless." Diana afraid exhibit much interest doings Harkaways, lest she arouse suspicion. So she simply nodded, listened anxiously garrulous old woman would say next. "So careless; anyone might get house side door," said ancient dame. "Well, fault robbed." "True. But would little credit robber; think brigands afraid enter town, do not take many precautions." Diana treasured every word this. Presently old woman, finding her guest conversationally inclined, went again, Diana left alone. The sun set, darkness began gather rapidly she went out, going little way street, returned, sought side door Harkaway's house. She turned handle softly entered. There one kitchen she found herself, subdued noise knives forks another apartment convinced her dinner meal. Diana, soon she ascertained fact, glided like spectre stairs, noiselessly examined various bedchambers. At length she decided hiding herself one seemed better furnished others. "This must it," she thought. And she right. It apartment Mrs. Harkaway. On dressing-table folded paper. Diana opened it, found milliner's bill Mrs. Harkaway. "For making pearl-grey silk dress, etc., etc." To hide herself Diana's next move. Clutching her sharp dagger firmly her hand, vengeful woman concealed herself behind tapestry waited. Nor she long wait. A light foot heard without. The door opened, second afterwards, graceful female form seated mirror, back towards Diana. And female voice said-- "This pearl-grey silk suits complexion far better I thought would. But fits badly. These Greek milliners compared London Paris." Then wearer pearl-grey silk heaved deep sigh, Diana softly moved curtain aside little get view person spoken. The face visible, figure generally, Diana slightest doubt Mrs. Harkaway. "I want new jewellery sadly," continued "pearl-grey silk;" "but yet, all, would scarcely safe wear here, brigands neighbourhood. But soon done for." The widow glided her hiding-place wearer silk dress continued-- "We one villain safe enough, another, Mathias, smothered chimney--ha, ha, ha, ha--oh!" The laugh ended deep groan, never came slightest sound lips moment merry. Diana struck hard surely second blow needed, first pierced human heart. "That laugh insult memory dead husband," she said. "Let none dare scoff Mathias." Like shadow, she glided away, leaving wearer pearl-grey silk sitting motionless mirror. Dead! The silk dress soaked her heart's blood. A minutes later, one entered Mrs. Harkaway's apartment, arose fearful cry-- "Help! murder!" CHAPTER XXIII. YOUNG JACK IN TROUBLE--THE COUNCIL--DOOM OF THE BOYS--A SOLDIER'S GRAVE AT DAYBREAK. Young Jack Harry Girdwood, friends supposed grievously ill-treated, found dragged rough brutal hands considerable distance shore unfortunately landed. The boy young Jack rescued, decoyed ruin, disappeared once. "Jack," said Harry Girdwood, recovered first shock, "we done for." "No mistake that," returned young Jack, gloomily. "Well, well, fault ours; consolation." "A precious poor consolation, since are." "Yes." Here interrupted captors. "Move on!" The voice Hunston's, sufficed young Jack show signs opposition. Vain obstacle. The ruffians glad slightest pretext brutality. "We quite comfortable are," said young Jack. "Insolent brat!" said Hunston contemptuously. "You shall birched well that." The colour mounted boy's face spite himself. "You threaten safety, fellow," said young Harkaway, turning facing old enemy, "since many backers protect you." Hunston grew livid. "You wretched spawn hated race," he ejaculated his teeth, "do dare speak me?" "There much daring required," retorted Jack, boldly. The words barely uttered Hunston dealt boy buffet nearly sent earth; young Jack pretty prompt returning it. This kind debt Harkaways long acquitting. Quick lightning recovering himself, he turned leapt upon Hunston, taking unexpectedly, he toppled fell upon him, clutching throat. "Now I will show lay dirty ringers Harkaway," exclaimed boy, glaring other's face. "Let go, or--" "My father trounced he age" cried boy excitedly, "and I will finish you--" But he allowed complete his threat. Rough muscular hands dragged off. Else Hunston fared badly. It momentary, sooner brigands perceived comrade danger seized hold young prisoner dragged off. Hunston sprang his feet, knife hand rushed upon boy, others interfered placed boy man. "Come, Hunston," said one men, "let alone." "But he struck me." "You provoked it." "What then? Shall I take blow he?" "You wrong strike child--a child unarmed." Hunston hung his head way putting it. "No matter; he shall die this." "Perhaps so; meanwhile, possibility ransom. The interests band allowed suffer you." Hunston silent. He sheathed his knife, his silent resolves less murderous unuttered. "Lead way, Simon," said brigand appeared chief spokesman. Simon stepped onward, behind young Jack Harry forced march. They walking captivity, could help themselves; wisely obeyed, give captors fresh excuse barbarity. The road Simon led gloomy narrow defile wound precipitously among hills. Sometimes rocks overhung road, sky barely visible, heaven altogether obscured, walk tunnels solid rock--too solid apparently worked hand man. On walked upon gloomy track, silence broken echo footfalls. Any thing desolate boys never beheld. A dull settled feeling loneliness despair fell upon two boy prisoners. After journeying way two miles came unexpectedly (to them--for course Simon guide knew he leading party) upon circular opening among hills, beneath appeared table land dark earth peat. "A swamp," said Harry Girdwood. "It looks like bog," said young Jack, "but yet I see something moving." "It water." "A lake." "Yes." "How black--how dismal looks." It did, indeed. Silent gloomy, like table metal, spread darkling waters strange lake. Wild desolate extreme. On every side enclosed towering heights, bare, treeless solemn. Both boys plainly impressed dull solemnity scene. "What look like?" said young Jack, low voice his companion. "I do not know--Lerna, famous marsh, near Argos." "No; Hercules killed Hydra, was not it?" "Yes." "I like think like that," he said, glancing around brigands them. "And might emulate example Hercules." "Ah, yes." "But enemies hydra-headed." The glanced eagerly he spoke. "It question; I almost sooner run good deal risk marched quietly off." Now present juncture signal topmost hills, upon trumpet note blown answer one brigands, dark, dusky forms appeared upon every side. Men sprang rocky hills round dark waters lake, promptly kilted savages responded summons chieftain, Rob Roy Macgregor Campbell. Whatever wild fancies two boy prisoners might minds, startling phenomenon effectually drove away. And fortunate was, too, them. Hunston called halt. The men nothing loth. The road traversed steep rugged, perhaps told less upon two boy prisoners upon party. The brigands sat refreshed. They made hearty meal cold meat coarse bread herbs, drank wine skins swarthy faces flushed purple; whilst feasted made merry, captives constrained look on--in envy perhaps--but share banquet. Hunger fell upon them. But boys guessed sufferings would give pleasure captors, kept troubles particular themselves. "Tighten belt," said Harry Girdwood; "squeeze stomach, Jack, do not let wolves see peckish." "Not me." Taking hint, Jack drew reef. The two young comrades were, reality, much improved movement; thought were, imagination goes great way. But hunger intruder whose importunities denying length time, fell that, spite brave manful efforts keeping other's pluck spirit, he gnawed vitals way reduced stamina, spirits. "This prison," said Harry Girdwood gloomily; "I feared would be." "It rather like Lethe anything else," said young Jack, pointing silent water below. "If remain long, shall forget gone before, may sure. This place drive us wits spot could imagine." "Rather Styx Lethe," said Harry; "banish hope enter here." It indeed spot evoke gloomy reflections, boys frame mind indulge such. This place, found, fixed upon camp brigands, felt imperative change headquarters, since positive proof old stronghold known enemies. Here danger surprise, men commanded every outlet, must rare chance take surprise. Within couple hours arrival two boy prisoners captors, whole band sauntered twos threes, vast host formed fairly amazed young Jack his companion. "Let us fix sum them," said Toro, "so parents friends may release wish." This approved one his hearers. There single dissentient voice. This Hunston's. "If attempt temporise," he said, "you beaten, sure." "Why?" "Beaten whom?" "Harkaway." "Bah!" "Such experience him," returned Hunston. "Nonsense; should not make sure money can?" "Why not?" said Hunston; "if can, I doubt." "Harkaway affectionate parent, I know well," said Ymeniz; "I heard dozen different sources. Once let know his son boy danger, he pay money release." "Well." said Toro, "let us say five hundred pounds." "Five hundred?" "Yes." "Not enough." "How much five hundred pounds?" demanded Ymeniz. "Twelve thousand, five hundred francs," replied Toro. "Very good, good; fair sum." "Is not?" "How shall claim it?" This question put assembled council generally, answered eagerly Hunston. "Let that?" "Very good, Hunston; task." "But remember old friend Tomaso still power cursed English." Toro paused, band arose unanimous cry-- "Tomaso must rescued avenged!" Hunston addressed business considerable interest. It necessary go correspondence took place, dilate upon ingenious manner letters delivered Hunston his emissaries. With his wonted shrewdness, he watched result his last threatening letter himself, making careful observations, he descended appointed spot fetched letter containing money. The five hundred pounds there, five Bank England notes one hundred each. "Five hundred pounds," he said, his vicious eyes glistening he touched crisp new notes, "five hundred pounds! Heaven, sum!" He looked him. He alone. Not soul sight. "Why I share it?" he said; "why mine?" Why indeed? Because he feared his lawless companions. Nothing more. "I will take hundred, one hundred," he muttered, half aloud, "and shall serve double purpose. The four hundred shall remain mine, one hundred theirs, But seeing get nothing Harkaway, easily worked upon, I shall achieve I want one stroke; noble notion." Back he went, began comedy Hunston went like veteran actor, comedy destined tragic finale. "Toro," said Hunston Italian, "to I may speak leader brave fellows; also you, comrades general, I may talk without fear motives way misconstrued." "Speak on." "Here reply cold-blooded Englishman Harkaway demand ransom, witness I exact unreasonable sum." "No, no." "What says he?" "He sends this," returned Hunston, holding single hundred pound note: "one hundred pounds--two thousand, five hundred francs--in word, one-fifth sum demanded, letter." A murmur indignation followed. "What letter say?" demanded. "He defies us; he offers sum, says boys released sunrise, he come fetch them." "Let come." "So say I; shall done boys meanwhile?" A momentary silence followed; came deep stern words-- "Let die." This speaker Toro. The Italian's words eagerly caught up. "Aye, let die; when?" "When will," said Hunston; "I care not, lid them. We see clearly counting upon Harkaway people ransom set us, however reasonable demands may be." "True." "Then, I say, let die to-day." "Impossible," said one brigands, stepping forth. "Why?" "Because traitor, Lirico, die daybreak; cannot two executions near other. Let die together." "Lirico," said Hunston, "and he die? I have not heard he offended." "A hateful thing," reply his informant; "Lirico offended foundation rule band." "How?" "He kept booty he gained, law member band shall conceal his booty, part fragment same, prejudice his comrades fellows shall die death traitor." Hunston silent. But anybody watching closely then, would noticed he changed colour. It unpleasant topic tackle English ruffian upon, taken place. "Why silent, comrade?" said old brigand named Boulgaris, staring Hunston full face; "do approve?" "Of what?" "Of law." "I--of course." "Of course do," said Boulgaris boldly; "why, would first approve. Who could approve law you, honest Hunston?" "Who, indeed?" Hunston winced cool scrutiny Greek. Did he know aught taken place? The idea utterly absurd. He (Hunston) taken much care he observed vulgar pryer like Boulgaris find corner spy upon his movements. Still gave qualm. "Quite right," said Hunston, boldly; "quite right just; man play false his fellows deserves die death." "Hear, hear! Let die." "And two boys shall die him?" asked Boulgaris. "They shall, daybreak." This put assembled throng, agreed all, suddenly single dissentient voice heard. "They shall die." The brigands looked up, boy appeared upon scene, boy lured luckless lads present unlucky pitch. "Theodora." "Aye, Theodora," responded boy--or rather girl--for girl was, long since discovered, although male attire. "And shall die, Theodora?" asked Hunston. "Ask rather die?" she said sadly. "What done merit death?" "Hullo, hullo!" ejaculated Toro. "Why, whatever meaning change tone? I thought you, like others, eager revenge." "Why?" "Why? Need I already remind ample vengeance have?" "No," returned Theodora, calmly. "But boys innocent harm." "Then lure destruction?" The woman sighed. "Ah, indeed?" "Yes, why?" "I wicked, cruel, base, deceptive," she replied; "words cannot paint wickedness. But I punished badness peril I never yet known; really running danger I thought affect better lure destined victims doom, I rescued grave them, boys--brave, brave boys--whom I sought destroy. Now," she added, turning bodily assembled brigands, "can ask I changed tone?" A dozen voices heard once, uttered different sentiments. "These prisoners mine right," said Theodora, "for I taken them, I brought here; dispose them." Some brigands agreed this; majority, overruled Toro Hunston, denied her jurisdiction altogether matter. The girl made passionate appeal assembled brigands. But vain. They resolved. It put vote, result easily foreseen. Death. Death majority voices ten one. "Death gibbet," exclaimed Hunston, triumphantly. "Aye, aye." "Nay," cried girl, superhuman energy, "these two poor boys shown better men present. See bear fate. Be men, then, must die, let die like soldiers." An animated discussion ensued this, finally agreed hapless boys die next morning traitor Lirico. CHAPTER XXIV. QUALMS--THE EVE OF THE END--A SAD VIGIL Hunston close his eyes throughout night. The words Boulgaris rang his ear like knell. Lirico die concealing part spoil he made. What four hundred pounds he, Hunston, kept back sum fixed upon ransom two boys, Harkaway deposited spot agreed upon? He knew desperate men he cast his lot far well suppose moment could hope chance discover his secret. Would they? The bare possibility made shudder. His hand nervously sought hidden notes, concealed his chest, faintest rustle crisp new paper caused his cheek pale. Once he dozed off, barely his eyes closed ere he troubled dreams caused toss moan great bodily pain, he awoke, he, dared try sleep again, he arose went look prisoners. The two unfortunate boys awake, talking disconsolate author troubles, disguised girl lost saving. "Hullo, madam," exclaimed Hunston, brutally, "what here, talking condemned brats." "I seeking comfort them," replied girl; "to prepare butchers." "Butchers? Humph!" "I mean persuaded you." "No matter; better leave themselves." "At whose command?" demanded woman, drawing herself proudly. "At mine," returned Hunston, fast losing his temper. "What, dare!" ejaculated girl, flashing eyes. "Dare!" laughed Hunston. "Will go away leave boys alone, must I carry away?" The girl's colour forsook her cheek, she drew nearer Hunston, latter, startled her expression, drew back. "These unhappy boys doomed die daybreak," she said, "but stay moment longer molest annoy them, I summon men tell would insult murder them." "It false." "I know it," replied woman, fiercely, "but suppose I would hesitate that? And would life worth?--what, I ask? Why, would wait explanation; presence would sufficient; would tear asunder. Begone, craven blackheart. Go." Hunston muttered something indistinctly, he bent his head storm fierce woman's wrath slunk away. She turned boys. "My poor fellows," she said, tenderly, her manner changing magic, "my unfortunate, brave lads, I you?" "You earned gratitude," returned Harry Girdwood, "by whipping gave cur." "Indeed have," chimed young Jack, warmth. "How like beaten hound he looked," said woman. "But I ever hope forgiven you?" "We nothing forgive." "Aye, have; saved life I take yours." "Not you." "I indirectly." "Perhaps; rate innocent because." The girl's distress painful witness. She conceived great affection two boys, her youthful preservers, she could tell far she guilty. She dare avow she started upon risky trip sea intention simulating peril afterwards became real, decoying two boys she done. No; she dare avow this. She soon repented her share black business. Soon--aye, soon late. Too late! The thought wrung her heart, she bent her head wept. "This painful," said young Jack. "It is, Jack," said his comrade, broken voice. "I do not like see boy crying." They still ignorant friend's real sex. * * * * * "What that?" "What?" "Do not hear?" "I do; sounds like heavy instrument beating earth close hand." "Yes, like digging." The three started word. No sooner uttered meaning struck three, sent chill hearts. Digging fatal hour, short time daybreak, could one significance. Grave-making; two hapless boys quailed awful sound, accuse cowardice? No. Assuredly not. Who amongst bravest could listen sound unmoved? To callous thing would shown mere senseless logs, nothing more. "You know is?" she said, faint voice. "We do," responded Harry Girdwood. "And you?" This young Jack. "Yes." The reply given grave voice, befitting solemn occasion. Yet voices never trembled, never faltered. She understood well, her expression showed clearly words admiration she felt courage. "I glad know worst," she said, low impressive tone, "for unpleasant task telling left me. Have thing say before--" "No." "All I would say," remarked young Jack, "that since mean assassinating us, I hope work cleanly, put us torture." "At worst," added his companion, "we shall give satisfaction seeing us beg pray mercy." "It would useless." "We know it." "And shall give chance saying two Englishmen showed white feather." "Bravely spoken," said girl, "but night growing old, listen I say." And she made communication considerably startled them. At first listened though dream, could believe reality she said, sorry believe truth. The nature communication appear later on. "And now," she said solemnly, "the time short. I must insist upon sleeping. Rest, I watch side. A friendly voice least shall call last dreadful trial all." CHAPTER XXV. THE TRIPLE EXECUTION--A SOLDIER'S GRAVE--TORO'S LUCK. Morning dawned. The eastern sky tinged light rising sun bugle call summoned firing party. The party question composed six men commanded Hunston. He insisted upon post, one none brigands envied him--so he might gloat his victims last hour. The two boys aroused difficulty, strange though may appear, sleeping soundly fatal moment approached. "Come," said girl, hollow voice. "Lirico already ground." "We must not behindhand then." "No," added Harry Girdwood; "they must see Englishmen face death." And then, led girl had, her sorrow, brought dire pass, came spot tragedy take place. Lirico, traitor, already pinioned, he stood his eyes bandaged upon edge grave shortly receive his lifeless body. Upon either side newly-dug trench grave. One young Jack. The his stout-hearted comrade. They needed telling now; went his part horrible ceremony though previously rehearsed. Not word spoken. The signs emotion boys exhibited silently wrung other's hands taking places graves. The girl passed unhappy victims shook hand one other. "Courage," she said, low firm voice, "courage, brave hearts." "Bandage eyes," said Hunston. "No; let us look upon fate," said young Jack. "The old Harkaway brag last," said Hunston, sneer. "You do not like look Harkaway face, assassin!" retorted boy. "Fool!" exclaimed Hunston, "since want it, shall it. Fire middle first. They opportunity seeing real man die eyes. It may give relish share follow." The word given. "Ready! Present! Fire!" The six rifles flashed simultaneously. Then, wounded Lirico struck, he bounded air fell back grave--stone dead! Hunston stood smiling grimly, even men turned sick butchery forced enact. He, fiend-like satisfaction, noticed sickly pallor two boys' faces, gladdened his black heart. "They are not quite happy now," he muttered. "Now suffer. Oh, Harkaway too. It would make drunk joy." The girl turned young Jack. "Courage," she whispered, "courage; bold." And turning firing party, she said-- "Come, delay. It needless prolong sufferings poor boys feel already." "Silence, begone!" exclaimed Hunston fiercely. "You right speak men." "I every right," returned woman, boldly. "Silence yourself, I say, know place!" Her voice manner half-awed Hunston, fell back pace two. "My poor comrades," she went on, addressing firing party, "this work taste. I will load you." So saying, she set work reload rifles, piled now. And she observed greatest care task. "Not shot must miss," she said men firing party, earnestly. "Every bullet must billet. We murder, even torture, unhappy boys." Hunston smiled sardonically. "How tender-hearted become," he said, sneer contempt. "Silence!" said girl, turning fiercely upon him, he actually quailed her indignant gaze. "Silence, I tell you, bully--butcher--villain--silence!" Hunston would retorted this, prudence bade silent. For girl great favourite men, he feared might take cudgels her way might unpleasant him. "So, young Harkaway," he said, jeeringly, "you wish see go you. It prolongs pleasure, I cannot complain. This one next." He pointed his sword Harry Girdwood. The latter looked deadly pale resolute. "Ready! Present! Fire!" Young Jack turned half round, saw his brave comrade clap his hand his breast, totter fall. A cry rose his lips. But he stifled ere Hunston small gratification. Hunston looked round young Jack, he positively bit his lips sheer vexation find he unable make boy betray least sign fear. "You keep well, boy," said Hunston, "but I know well ready sink ground fear, nevertheless." "Liar!" Hunston flushed purple. But he kept his rage. "As going die, boy, I may let birching impertinence merits. You old brag father." Jack silent. "All his deceit; his sham falseness--" The boy said nothing. "All his craven-hearted, black-hearted villany." But young Jack saw other's game clearly enough. He held his peace. He knew well enough real way enrage ruffian appear unmoved his taunts. So Hunston exhausted his expletives give word firing party, young Jack spoke. "One moment." Hunston made men sign ground arms. The boy beg mercy. Here, then, one chance wreaking his spite upon lad. Now he able feast his ears unhappy boy's piteous appeals, he well judged that, he began plead pity, his fortitude would go. "Before fire," said young Jack, pale resolute, his comrade Harry shown himself, "one word." "Go on." "I speak one brink grave," said boy, "and words may prophetic. Before many weeks over, shall kneel sue mercy father, denied you. You grovel dirt, crawl cringe abject misery; hopeless, bitterness despair think moment, curse hour ever molested one race, anyone interested." "Ha, ha, ha!" laughed Hunston, boisterous forced manner; "quite sermon. Preaching new quality Harkaways. It unfortunate cut early youth. You would soon bloom odd mixture Puritan bully." But he could provoke his victim. Having said he say, young Jack coolly folded his arms waited end tragedy, apparently hearing Hunston saying. * * * * * "Make ready! Present! Fire!" As word spoken, volley fired. The unhappy boy--the last three victims--threw his arms, fell back new-made grave yawning receive him. Poor young Jack! The body even quiver fallen grave. Apparently death instantaneous. "Fill graves cover carrion," said Hunston; "and let us get away make merry." The girl stepped interposed herself. "Begone leave rest me," "To you?" "Aye." "What for?" "It agreed," said one men. "Let us pray now," said girl. "Surely, destroyed bodies, wish harm." She waited reply, falling upon her knees, soon lost holy meditation, her hands clasped fervently, her head bent upon her breast. The men doffed hats reverently glided noiselessly away. Hunston feared shock superstitious susceptibilities, he followed silence. * * * * * For several hours she left her meditations. And when, hours later day, Hunston returned spot, three graves filled in. Over two unhappy lads pious hands raised rough wooden cross. "The first taste vengeance," muttered Hunston. "May others soon follow," said voice his elbow. He started. It Toro. "This turn luck," said Italian, exultingly. "I hope so." "I feel so. The rest hated race soon follow, least good fortune." CHAPTER XXVI. THE BRIGAND'S RECRUIT--HUNSTON'S PERIL--DELICATE GROUND. "Who it?" "Where?" "Below; crevasse. Look again." "I see; Ymeniz." "It is, is." The speakers two brigands plying lawless trade; passing along mountain ridge, short time execution, suddenly espied body man lying flat upon his back. Upon his breast something white, could quite distinguish. The form features, however, particular difficulty recognising. It comrade Ymeniz, could see well. "He fallen there," said one other. "It looks so." Now, strange relate, although said other, misgivings. The body lay strange attitude. However, soon proceeded solve problem, set doubts rest. Passing lower ridge circuitous path well known both, reached bottom crevasse. "He dead--murdered!" "Hah!" "And here, powers evil!" exclaimed brigand, "here confession murderer." "A confession!" exclaimed brigand. "Yes. Take it," said other, lifting paper blood-stained breast slain Ymeniz, "take read yourself." "Nay, know I scholar; read me." In sonorous voice brigand read following document-- "I, Jack Harkaway, proclaim war knife murderers boys. The villains Hunston Toro tell I never threatened vain. One number shall die daily I exterminated root branch. No amount precaution upon part avert doom. You claimed ransom five hundred pounds son. I paid sum demanded, played false; therefore, die. To last man shall perish. You shall learn look forward fate fear trembling; day day survivors, anticipating turn, shall learn curse hour led murder two innocent boys. Beware!" The two brigands looked half scared. "What that, think?" The looked nervously around replying. "It grave." "Very." "Poor Ymeniz! he stabbed back." "No; death wound heart." "Then he taken surprise." "Evidently." The two men made way despatch camp, carrying paper them. The sensation caused indescribable Boulgaris read aloud assembled brigands. "Death Englishman Harkaway!" exclaimed one brigands, impetuously. The cry caught eagerly all--save one. This one Hunston. It he hated Harkaway less intensely his comrades he remained silent. It simply his fierce denunciation brigands, Harkaway told money. Lirico barely cold his grave offence which, beside Hunston's, mere paltry pilfering. The secret great danger now. If believe Harkaway, his (Hunston's) position indeed critical. What he do? What would better cast doubt derision upon Harkaway's dark menaces. "The man charlatan, humbug," he said, curling his lip; "and his purpose accomplished could he know it, he not, I glad say. He would laugh rarely could he know alarm taken message." But would let pass unchallenged. "It joke, Hunston," said Boulgaris, seriously. "How know?" demanded Hunston, quickly. "The death Ymeniz proof enough. That joke." "True!" "Moreover, I one feel sure Englishman Harkaway speaks truly." "How?" "In saying he gave ransom." "In full?" "In full." "Why, where, then, think is?" demanded Hunston, assumption boldness, yet trembling he waited reply. Boulgaris answered single word-- "Stolen." A murmur ran round assembled throng. "What!" cried one brigands, stepping forward; "is possible thieves traitors amongst us?" "Never!" "Death traitors, say I!" "And I." "And I." And cry went round mouth mouth. Hunston trembled his life. "Who stolen money?" demanded one men, fiercely. "Who he charged fetch money old well, spot appointed--who comrade fetched money?" "Why," exclaimed Toro, turning Hunston, "then was--" He paused. Hunston turned heartsick every eye directed towards him. "Never!" exclaimed Hunston, fiercely. This critical moment latter. For awhile his life hung upon slender thread. Hunston, begin with, favourite. But he lucky villain. At moment matters looking unpleasant, attention called another direction. "Do hear that? The sentry giving alarm." They accustomed danger, qui vive ere alarm fairly sounded. Pistols, knives, blunderbusses called requisition. And ready give intruder warm reception. Toro climbed crag peered over. Then turning men, he motioned silence. "Hush! He comes way. Back!" And then, sign him, every man glided quickly, silently off, concealed behind rock, bush, wherever favourable place discovered. Then stumbling noise heard, man crept gap hobbled scene. He strange, wild-looking fellow, long fair hair eyebrows almost light albino's. His cheeks fair, much sunburnt, almost destitute beard. He progressed difficulty, leant heavily upon staff cut roughly tree, green bark slovenly-stripped branches recently cut, too. He apparently young man, he progressed much difficulty, natural inference fatigue perhaps illness it. He dressed tattered outlandish costume. He carried long knife stuck his waistband, he arms beyond this. His arms bare elbow, left one bleeding flesh wound look many hours' old. Evidently he milksop, although wound pretty severe, care he taken tie loosely strip white rag. Perhaps he lost blood began feel it, for, he drew open, he dropped heavily upon rocky seat gave sigh grunt relief. "I am sorry come anchor." He spoke English. But he thought rest peace, he destined disappointed. Barely he stretched his legs, he startled sound his side, glancing up, he found huge, black-muzzled fellow towering covering long-barrelled horse pistol. "Hullo!" Out came his long knife instanter. "Move speak, I pull trigger," said brigand. "Thank nothing," said stranger. "Who you?" demanded brigand. "Just I ask you," returned stranger, lightly. "Whence come you?" "Precisely question I going put." The brigand's colour came he grew vicious. "If wise, you will try fool me," he said. "If wit," retorted new-comer, "you will come pestering questions; I am humour, I put out, I am dangerous. Good-morning." The brigand, finding he could get nothing eccentric stranger, fell back pace two, latter thought he molested further. He mistaken. Nor he long making discovery. The withdrawal brigand signal regular mob lawless men make appearance. Every nook cranny opening guarded armed men; now, cool stranger glanced up-wards, he found dozen rifles, pistols blunderbusses pointed him. Still he appear disconcerted. He glanced coolness remarkable, muttered-- "Dear, dear, attentive dear boys are." Before he could speak them, however, stepped hiding places, firearms still making target, advanced close upon him. When he saw object manoeuvre, he jumped plucked his knife. "So, so," he cried, "sold, eh? Come on, you." "What he say?" demanded one Greeks, turning Toro. "He challenges us fight him." "Why, fellow's mad Englishman." "Yes," said Hunston, "an Englishman. That makes feel he match mob Greeks, I do not know madness." Suddenly stranger appeared liven up. "What, police, then?" he ejaculated. "Police!" said Hunston, contemptuously turning round speaker. "What mean that?" "Why, I took police pursuit me." "What doing?" "Am I among friends?" "We brigands, speak freely." "Well, then, I unlucky wretch forced bolt away his master his living--and nothing." "What call nothing?" said Toro. "A trifling peccadillo, sir; nothing more, I assure you--merely pounds paltry bit jewellery belonging Englishwoman name Harkaway." They pricked ears name. "Hullo, hullo!" exclaimed Toro; "what this? Stand forward, man. Do know Harkaway?" "I do--to sorrow," replied man; "he master." The brigands pricked ears this. "Harkaway's servant, you?" said Hunston, eagerly. "I was, sir." "And may object coming here?" "To join you." "Do know--" "Who are? Yes, course; least I guess it--I am uncommon good guessing." And he chuckled again. "The fellow's idiot," said Hunston. "Do bring information us?" This question put Italian bully brigand, stranger turned elaborate bow. "What want?" "To get hold Harkaway himself," cried Toro. "Then I help this." "You can--then money shall yours," said Toro. "I hope so; why, I have got already them." "You have!--much?" "A pretty lump. Look." It bag money composed pieces copper, silver gold. It good round sum, looked considerably was. "Is all?" "I nicknacks," added stranger, producing bundle tied his pocket-handkerchief. They tore open bundle eagerly found contain various articles plate, silver candlestick, jewels. "Those," he said, pointing latter, "belonged Mrs. Harkaway, I believe she set store them--they wedding presents." "So much better," exclaimed Toro, exultingly. "So say I," added Hunston. "Is fair amount fellow bring his entrance fee?" demanded stranger. "What say you, comrades?" demanded Toro bystanders. "You best judges. Shall admit man brother comrade?" "We will," shouted brigands. "Agreed hands?" said Italian chief. "Agreed." It answered single voice. "Good," said Toro; "do you, Boulgaris, prescribe oath." The oath, administered Greek, understood novice, he subscribed cheerfully. "You swear devote life destruction enemies," said Hunston. "I do," responded new brigand, fervour. "Enough. What name?" "Geoffrey Martin." "Geoffrey Martin," repeated Toro; "the name ring I like. Now understand, end Harkaways draws near; one already paid forfeit." "Who?" cried stranger. "Two!" said voice. The brigands turned beheld Diana, widow Mathias. "Two already fallen, I struck wife hated Harkaway heart dagger," cried fierce woman. And she recounted (as done previous chapter) she gained admittance Harkaway mansion, concealed herself Mrs. Harkaway's chamber, dealt her fatal blow. To brigands' new recruit listened calmly enough. When, air triumph, Diana concluded her narration, brigands cheered loudly. "Another hated foes dead. Three cheers brave Diana!" "Certainly," said Geoffrey Martin politely. And his voice heard general shout. "Now, gentlemen," said he, silence restored, "allow correct one slight error statement good valorous lady." "What that?" demanded Toro. "Her narrative quite correct, little exception--it Mrs. Harkaway killed." Diana turned pale, uttering wail disappointment, sat down. Hunston, venting fearful imprecations, said-- "Then I hope trust may wife confounded Harvey." "It not, tell truth, I rather glad it, for, know I almost fallen love her?" "Cheek!" muttered Hunston. "Well, it, then?" "You must know I waiting dinner table, Mrs. Harkaway expressed wish her fan, she forgotten, might brought. "I going call female servants, Harkaway went he gone minute, heard scream out-- "Help! Murder!" Away rushed Harvey long American fellow, Jefferson, Mrs. Harkaway fainted. But minutes three came back news Mrs. Harkaway's maid--Marietta name--had killed. "No fault yours, madam, girl dressing herself Mrs. Harkaway's clothes, doubt she looked much lady her mistress." "What then?" demanded Diana. "The police took matter hand, searching everywhere murderer." "Let search," said Diana, scornful laugh. There silence time; Diana asked-- "Did hear anything Tomaso?" "Yes. He condemned die." "When?" demanded Toro. "The date kept secret, may less chance rescuing him." Toro growled oath departed. CHAPTER XXVII. THE RECRUIT WORKS BRAVELY--HARKAWAY's VENGEANCE--"HE NEVER FORGETS A DEBT." The brigands soon found made invaluable acquisition new recruit. The day following his admission honorable fraternity, he brought addition his already handsome booty. This shape lady's reticule, containing rich prize money, jewels. "I came across late mistress," said Geoffery Martin explanation; "she ventured town her new maid, I fleeced royally. I leave stiver; moreover I secured this." So saying, he spread newly-printed placard, which, translated, ran nearly possible wise-- "FIVE THOUSAND FRANCS REWARD "Will paid police private person, secure, give information may lead capture of, one Geoffrey Martin, lately valet service Mr. John Harkaway." Then followed description his person, walk, mode speech. "The said Geoffrey Martin absconded large sum money, besides property great value, duty every man aid bringing justice." He chose good moment bringing paper in. There large muster brigands camp. "Five thousand francs reward," he said his newly-made comrades generally; "you turn Harkaways, make small fortune." "You will find good men true here," said Hunston. Geoffrey Martin turned upon latter. "All?" There hidden significance his tone thrilled Hunston. "I glad safe, friend; way, name? I have not heard yet." "My name Hunston, I am ashamed it." "No, course would not be; Hunston?" he added reflectively. "Did know name?" "Yes." "Indeed. Heard master speak me, I suppose?" "Yes; Harkaway his friend Harvey." "Harvey," cried Hunston contemptuously; "a paltry, frivolous fool." "Yes; was not he? You hear speak you." "There never love lost us," said Hunston moodily; "we hated cordially boyhood." "Known long?" said Martin. "We school together, college together," said Hunston. "College--phew! must swell." "Well," he said haughtily, "and that?" "Oh, nothing; I thinking." "What thinking?" "Why, I half chance getting life, would never found here." "What mean? Are ashamed comrades?" "No, no, me," said Martin; "but I I you. You are swell, it is awful drop you. I am poor devil--a nobody, it is rise life join honorable company; give us hand." And then, he could say yea nay, new recruit seized Hunston hand wrung real affected warmth. Hunston strode moodily away, hanging his head. This singular individual, Geoffrey Martin, appeared greatly interested fate unfortunate boys, young Jack Harry Girdwood, he got Boulgaris take spot crosses erected graves pious hand Theodora, girl unwittingly lured fatal trap. "So buried them?" said Geoffrey Martin. "Yes, poor boys," said Boulgaris. "Poor boys," echoed Martin surprise, "poor boys." "Yes, I see reason butchering two children, little more." The new brigand eyed speaker rather curiously. "Have pity spare Harkaway's boy?" "And not?" said Boulgaris. "True, Harkaway's enemy, I hate him; I would like get upper hand him; do not want fight boys. Besides, Harkaway good sort enemy; bold, daring fellow, sneak." "No, he is not," said Geoffrey Martin, warmth. "I sure he would never murder boy boy's father wronged him." "True." "Besides, something Hunston I do not like. We bad enough conscience, brutal butchery will, perhaps ruin band." "Why?" "Well, loved before; brutal deed make us execrated whole country. The government scarcely dare molest us; satisfied keeping show something. But Harkaway rich powerful, I told; English money English influence force government pursue us, what? Why, murdering two helpless children, done us wrong; fell trap saving life one us." Geoffrey Martin opened his eyes astonishment. "Is true?" "Yes. Did not know story?" "No." "It daughter one old comrades, boys saved sailing. Poor girl! If prayers tears could move men's hearts, saved boys." Geoffrey Martin coughed blew his nose loudly. "Ahem!" he said, staring Boulgaris. "You soft-hearted fellow brigand." "Not exactly either," replied Boulgaris, grinning. "I feel incensed deed brutality, exposing band risks dangers sole purpose gratifying revenge." "Theirs; mean Hunston's?" "No; Toro interested also it." "Toro, Toro," muttered Martin; "why, name sounds, familiar me. Of course. They knew Toro Italy, I remember. He one band Harkaway his friend Harvey exterminated." "It true, then, band?" said Boulgaris, his eyes flashing eagerly. "Of course." "You see, then, that, dread arousing enmity man Harkaway." "He awkward customer, that is fact it; I heard, brave Boulgaris, Harkaway says he revenge, he never fails. Now, let us return." Back went together, neared brigands' camp, perceived signs great commotion. "What matter now?" asked Boulgaris. "Come us," replied first man, "and I show you." They silently followed. Down one slopes narrow pass, within five minutes' run brigands' stronghold, came upon number men gathered around long figure stretched upon ground covered cloak. The brigand brought silently drew back cloak, showed figure corpse one comrades guard there. "Look, another men killed. His death, like first, sudden." A sure, swift hand pinned body long dagger. It pierced his heart, point blade actually protruded near his shoulder-blade. "Look there," cried one brigands, "Where?" "At handle." Fastened haft dagger slip paper, upon words-- "_Remember Harkaway never forgets injury._" CHAPTER XXVIII. THE VILLA AGAIN--A MESSAGE FROM THE ENEMY'S CAMP--HOW A SNARE WAS LAID. Harvey carried his project execution, went off, leaving Mrs. Harvey Mrs. Harkaway impression he going vessel, making preparations generally departure. They one anxious gone place, evermore associated minds mishaps last days. When Harvey absent forty-eight hours, grew anxious. But morning third day, Nabley detective came message Dick. He met appointment brought news. There something Nabley's face made Harkaway anxious see alone. "Now tell me, Nabley," he said, eagerly, "tell all. How Harvey? What he say boys? What he doing? Has he plan action decided?" "Gently, Mr. Harkaway, gently," said detective; "you overpower me." "Oh, Nabley, I say--" "There, there! do not impatient. I will give fast ever I can." "I do not want all," interrupted Jack Harkaway, passionately. "How boys? Answer that. Are safe? No, no! I read face." And he dropped heavily chair, looking picture misery despair. Nabley scarcely word say himself. The sight brave Harkaway utterly collapsed he could endure. Jack rallied little turned Nabley. "Well, quick, tell news." And then, Nabley still stammered, he went on-- "I know; save breath. I knew it; poor boys! poor Harry poor brave boy Jack." "Dirk Harvey bids keep courage up," said Nabley; "not downcast. It quite time enough upon luck find worst true. The boys may yet live." "No, no," cried Jack; "I fear poor boys more." "Let us hope still live, meanwhile, Mr. Harvey treated brigands though worst true." "How?" Nabley made significant gesture his right arm though stabbing violently unseen enemy. "What, brave Dick seeking taking revenge?" exclaimed Jack. "Yes. Two Greek brigands fallen his hand. The rest follow, sure that; and, moreover, never suspect whose hand dealt blow." "Not suspect!" "No, his game continue picking single file. He meets one alone, Harvey makes sure his strong right arm." "Oh, brave Harvey," said Jack. "Yes," said Nabley, "it revenge. An eye eye, tooth tooth; I one like see whole gang food kites wolves." "You suffered losing old comrade," said Harkaway; "judge, then, keenly feel loss friend, must I feel boy--my flesh blood." "Yes," said Nabley; "I suffered, I yet bitter revenge poor pal's murderers. He brave true friend. Poor Pike! he foully assassinated." "Yes, Nabley; he cowardly shot villain Toro. But brigands know taking revenge them?" "Yes; told black white. A paper fixed carrion carcase tells another proof Harkaway's vengeance." Jack's face flushed crimson words. "Well done, Dick; well done, brave old boy," he muttered; "well done!". "And he tells rare state camp. It thrown lot greatest consternation. Hunston grown unpopular. It needs little upon Harvey's part make sure him." "That is brave." "Now he is growing ambitious. One time longer satisfies him, he scheme bagging half-a-dozen brigands once." "How?" "You know spot boys christened fig-tree grove." "I do." "He pretends intercepted letter (when he "stole" money jewels I took way keeping appearances), informs one party--a Mr. Hardy, Harpy, he pretended--would passing fig-tree grove evening, money, journey importance. As Hardy Harpy dangerous person, brigands, Harvey's advice, send six best men business." Harkaway's eyes twinkled this. "Now," said Nabley, "we must bait trap well. I will bait." "You?" "Yes." "But dangerous post?" "I prefer it," said Nabley, quietly; "besides, although alone, I shall staunch valuable friends me." "You speak paradoxes, Mr. Nabley." The detective's reply draw his two hands his coat-pockets, hand six-shooter. "Here twelve lives," said detective, "and I have six here," tapping his breast. "You are regular arsenal," said Harkaway, smiling. "But supposing, raise hands, close upon ransack pockets." "I need withdraw hands use them. I fire pockets." They must made something intention, cut side seams coat exceedingly roomy. "Well, well," said Harkaway, jumping up, "when get work?" "Now." "Now?" "There preparations make, Let Mr. Jefferson sent for. Both get arms ready, follow me." "Good. What arms?" "Short axe, case close work, rifle each. You will match six Greeks. Besides," he added, significant smile, "I shall idle." "Well, well; away you," cried Jack; "I eagerness work. I shall quite another man I brush beasts." "Right, sir," cried detective; "they find powerful foe you." "Yes, Nabley," cried Jack, "my arm nerved fight, shall go hard me, I revenge Greek devils murder poor boys." The door opened Jefferson entered. "The man!" exclaimed Harkaway. "What, Nabley!" said Jefferson. "What news Harvey?" "Mr. Harkaway tell all," answered detective; "my time's up. Follow quickly can." "Off you," said Harkaway, growing quite excited prospect brush enemy. "The fig-tree grove," said Nabley. "Understood." And went detective. "Jefferson," said Jack, "I seeking foes, fear I render good account actions, brigands I feel strength giant." CHAPTER XXIX. WHEREIN MR. MOLE PHILOSOPHISES AND HAS AN ADVENTURE--THE SCENT OF BATTLE--MOLE THE TERROR OF THE BRIGANDS--ISAAC THE ANNIHILATOR--MOLE'S PRISONER. It must supposed Isaac Mole idle time. He heard bold doings his friends Harkaway, Harvey Jefferson, speak valuable aid Nabley detective, and, figuratively speaking, his soul panted glory. "I feel I could conquer single hand half-a-dozen brigands," said Mole himself; "but still I prefer come across sleeping brigand. But ah, me!" he sighed deeply, "brigands rarely caught asleep weasels." Poor old Mole's desire distinguish matter great. The plain truth poor Isaac times badly henpecked. On occasions he would assume his dignified deportment point his wooden legs. "There proofs, Mrs. Mole," he would say, "that Isaac Mole never shunned foe his life." "Yah, yah!" his spouse would gracefully smile reply, "dat fault ob yours, Ikey Mole; de ignorant critters took legs often lost legs before." "Lost before?" "Yes." "Before amputated, mean?" "Yes." "Why, Mrs. Mole," he would draw his full height, "you surely indulging strong waters." "No, sar; no, Ikey Mole, dis gal, sar. You lose legs continual head too, sar, strong waters--sperrits, sar, sperrits." Poor Mole, he match her, could turn consolation he ever thought drown dull care. The bottle. Mrs. Mole one day surprised sly tipple grounds villa, he knew his sorrow. Suddenly popping round corner, Chloe emptied contents pail his luckless head. "Thar, teetottler! banderhoper, good templar! Take leetle tiddy drop water rum; makes lubly grog well mixed, yah, yah!" And amiable partner his joys sorrows bore her empty pail, leaving her husband dry shiver. "Philosophy, dear Mole," said worthy Isaac himself, "philosophy physic; think Socrates ease--ugh! It is precious damp--too much water. I must extra drop keep cold out." And went inexhaustible bottle again. "Ha! Massa Ikey!" said terrible voice close hand, "you want water mix it, you?" Mole clutched his bottle, jumped up, rushed wildly house, his loving spouse another pail water. * * * * * From time Mole scarcely dared suck his bottle within half mile house. One afternoon, dined early, Mole went walk suburbs town, selecting favourable spot, he reclined gracefully dropped gentle slumber. How long he slept he never knew hour. All he knew he dreamt he hero gallant adventures, wherein Greek brigands fell his sword like corn reaper's sickle; yea, phantom miscreants succumbed onslaught Don Quixote. Now, he slept, man crawled thicket upon fours looked eagerly him. The singular part incident that, although sleeping Mole within six feet spot, he perceive him. Mole partly hidden thickly-grown bushes. The man dragged painfully on; he badly hurt. One his legs broken, he carried less three pistol bullets his body; short, little less marvellous he able crawl all. The history miserable wretch soon told. He shot unerring aim Nabley detective, feeling badly hurt, he sought safety flight yet time. Dragging his wounded body thickly-grown copse, he lain hidden sight, baffling keenest search; he presently lost consciousness. Loss blood anguish rendered hapless wretch powerless help himself, knowing well little mercy he expect Englishmen come upon him, lain fear trembling every sound hunger added his torments. He nearly blinded blow he received face, his hope able crawl along he came his comrades, would help regain stronghold mountains. "Oh!" he groaned, "a blight upon hand struck down. Oh!" And violence his pains made give deep groan. Mole moved. Then opened his eyes; waking, his glance fell upon ghastly looking object, pale bloody, dragging along. Coming towards him. Mole gasped. This real, he knew once; doubt that. It one Greek brigands, seen asleep, doubt, him. Poor Mole. Cold beads perspiration stood upon his brow. A channel sweat trickled small his back. His wig stood his scalp terror. What he do? Alas! would soon him. The ghastly object crawled on. A minute wretched man would him. Now, poor old Mole occasions called pot-valiant. He sought his black bottle Dutch courage; he could raise his bloodless lips, wounded man perceived him, he gave cry terror. "Keep off!" cried Mole, his teeth rattling like box dominoes. The wounded man, half blind he frightened little sense remained him, took black bottle another revolver Nabley carried; wholesome dread terrible weapon, he cowered down, hiding his face ground. "Do not violent," exclaimed wretched Mole. "Mercy, mercy!" implored brigand. "Have pity me," said Mole, abject terror. "Do please me," whined brigand, "only mercy's sake do not fire poor wretch I am." "Think helpless condition," said Mole. "I done death," said brigand. "I two wooden legs," gasped Mole. "Do me," cried brigand, despair, "only give water--a drop mercy's sake." And he prostrated abject submission half dead Mole. Now latter could well misunderstand attitude; yet he could scarcely believe evidence his senses. "What is his game?" thought Mole; "he trying artful dodge on; he is going jump give one myself--not Isaac. By jingo! What topper I could give he lays there, a--" He stopped short. "My eye! hole he got his head already." And degrees, spite his fears, he forced see piteous object dangerous. As Mole rose look brigand, latter made still signs submission, he could longer misunderstand. It difficult say feeling filled Mole completely, surprise satisfaction. "Oh, oh," cried Mole; "I feel heart tells I great courage. Yes, I capture desperate brigand brave hands." Here slice luck. "I will drive home," said crafty Isaac himself, "and see Chloe dare cheek she done late. I rather flatter I shall take Harkaway Jefferson themselves." First, though, he meant one suck black bottle. But again, his intense surprise, sight bottle, wounded man cowered shrank back terror. "Mercy, mercy, great captain," he implored; "as strong, merciful." "What he mean?" muttered astonished Mole. "Do not fire again," cried wounded man feebly; "I never hurt one friends. I responsible two boys' death. It done without will, I do not war boys women; ah, I suffer." "Do not fire! Why, what--ah, I see it; he takes bottle pistol. "March then," he said terrible voice; "on you, I will fire." "Do not, do not! mercy!" "March then, I will blow atoms," he presented black bottle again. The Greek held his hands supplication moved on. "Go on!" thundered Mole. "I will slave, abject slave," groaned brigand; "but oh, great warrior, captain, spare life." "I will eat alive," hissed cannibal Mole his ear, "if do not walk faster." "I will, I will." "Faster still, die." "Pity, pity." "Bah!" said fierce Isaac, contemptuously, "why I pity killing score fellows hand? Answer that." The silent. In way, valiant Mole drove miserable wretch villa. When, long wearisome journey, got within stone's throw grounds house, Mr. Mole suddenly startled hear loud, shrill cry alarm, appear Mrs. Mole herself? "Whateber hab there, Ikey?" she demanded. "A prisoner, dear," responded Mole. "A what?" she exclaimed; "whose prisoner?" "Mine." "Yourn?" "Pardon me, dear--yours, yourn. Yes, prisoner," he added modestly; "I captured him." "Where?" "In wood." "What there, Ikey?" "I hunt. I came across them--five, little warm work went forward. The four," he added significantly, "I left backs, pretty decent sign handiwork upon them." Chloe gasped. "You are drefful man," said Chloe; "and I will run Massa Harkaway." And she dashed garden, crying Harkaway Jefferson, goodness knows besides. They ever upon _qui vive_ danger, came rush. "Why, Mr. Mole," exclaimed Jefferson, "you indeed got prize." "However manage it?" asked Harkaway, whit less startled. Mole coughed. "I felt something required me," he answered, touching dignity modesty combined, "and I went hunt myself, I fell foul Greek vampires." "A few," echoed Jefferson, elevating his eyebrows; "a few, said." "Yes," replied Mr. Mole, "only five." "Not more?" said Jefferson, laughing; "then must felt rather bad inside." "Never, sir," said Mole, getting dignified; "but I left enemy rather unhappy, inside outside." "Indeed!" "This survivor five; question closely." Mole carefully ascertained wounded Greek did not speak solitary word English. "Ask him, I say, I his comrades; I larded them--how I peppered them, made cry peccavi. Damme, Jefferson, old boy, seen action; gad, sir, I am like old war-horse first sniff powder. Down went, first one, other. Hang me! I did not play skittles with' them, I humour, Harkaway, cannot miss. I would cheek corner pin make royal every go. What think that, Harkaway?" Old Jack smiled. "I am proficient enough skittles appreciate feat," he answered. "And tackled lot single-handed?" "Yes." "How many?" "Ten." "I thought said five." "Ten, sir, ten all; five came first, many moments backs; came another five them, heavily armed. I never forget; hang it! I could not forget job easily. Five second lot fell first fire; I toppled three more, one--" What Mr. Mole might his ardour tempted draw upon his glowing fancy, impossible say, he reached point his fanciful narration, came Nabley. "Hullo!" he said, he caught sight wounded brigand; "here is missing man." "This," cried rest people present one voice. "Yes, man I shot first fire; he must crawled away hide; why, Mr. Mole running to?" The imaginative old gentleman suddenly vanished scene. He relish presence witness this. "This Mr. Mole's prisoner," said Jefferson, laughing; "you see he brought one, all." "I bring something better even prisoners," said detective. "What that?" "Good news." "Speak; it?" "The brigands given Hunston." Harkaway started words. "That news, indeed," he said; "and justice demands villain shall speedily hang." CHAPTER XXX THE FIG-TREE GROVE--A DOUBLE AMBUSCADE--THE LEECH-FISHER--HOW THE TRAP WAS BAITED, AND HOW IT TOOK--SOMETHING LIKE THE OLD FORM--TRIUMPHANT MARCH OF HARKAWAY AND CO. Within hour--nay, less--of foregoing conversation might seen aged man wending his weary way along high road Athens towards mountains. Thickly-grown fig trees leant road, well-garnished branches formed roof foliage ray sunlight could penetrate. He seemed aged man. His steps tottered. It strange he seek aid stout staff, walking stick least. But no, he preferred keep his hands his coat pockets. Now coat he wore full-skirted frock, much resembling shape garment worn grandfathers, fathers, George Third king, huge pockets skirts lappets. And big pockets old wanderer's arms buried elbows. Perhaps he felt somewhat chilly. There gentle breeze blowing trees. As he went along, he shot sly glances time time him, almost he expecting someone; he got nearly third distance fig-tree grove faintest signs life him, there, apparently overcome fatigue his walk, he dropped upon moss-grown bank rest. He looked leafy canopy overhead, sniffed sweet odours floated along gentlest zephyrs. "Not bad quarters," he muttered (it English he spoke); "not bad. There one thing required make happiest day life; one thing, is, success present undertaking--" He paused. "Hark!" What it? He heard faint rustling foliage hard by. This part country reported infested thieves, regular hunting grounds brigands. A faint smile lurked round corners old man's mouth, twinkle his eye. "At last," he muttered himself, "at last!" Just noise branches pushed aside dry twigs crushed; forth stepped stalwart peasant, rags tatters, placed himself, hat hand, old man. "Hullo!" exclaimed latter, "why, come from?" And yet his surprise looked assumed real. "Charity!" replied beggar. "Charity!" echoed old man, fumbling his pockets, "by means; take this, honest fellow." So saying, he dropped piece money his open palm. "Gold! Yes, golden piece, saints calendar." The beggar's eyes glistened greedily piece. "Heaven bless you!" he exclaimed; "may live ever." "Do not wish that," responded old man; "that blessing." "Not riches?" said mendicant "No." "You easily satisfied then." And came forth beggar strange sound. Was signal? It almost appeared result preconcerted arrangement, sound his laughter echoed leafy grove, crashing branches general breaking dried twigs undergrowth, swarmed group men numbering perhaps ten dozen. A villanous-looking mob too. They surrounded old man attack him, first man already profited old man's charity warned off. "There need violence here," said he, hurriedly, speaking native language; "he give us he got without much dirtying knife him." The old man laughed. A dry, cynical laugh too, almost calculated make one believe he understood said. "Who people?" he asked first beggar. "Poor men worthy pious charity, like myself," reply. "Then shall it," replied old man; "more expect." He looked around rather anxiously, expecting people arrive. Now glance observed one men, difficult matter excite suspicion minds. "He expects someone," said foremost man party; "he spy." "See he is looking him," observed another. "What shall do?" "Kill once." "Yes, kill him." "On him." And speaker first act upon his counsel. He stepped forward catch old man coat, latter, retreating couple paces, appeared startled. "Keep distance, masters," he said; "keep distance, I dangerous fellow." They laughed this. "Dangerous, are?" cried one them, "oh, oh! name?" "Why, call leech-fisher." "The leech-fisher!" "Yes." "What for?" "Because I trap bait all," They looked puzzled. "He is mad." "Daft he be." "Poor old fool. But let us get his money he any, without killing him." "Money!" echoed self-styled leech-fisher. "Here is plenty." And words he threw pile gold pieces upon ground, making lawless ruffians' eyes glisten greedily. "You do not seem yet understand parable leech-fisher," said singular old man. "You dense blockheads." "Ha, ha, ha! hear him," cried first beggar. "He quite treat." "What I meant I trap you. I set catch you; I bait; leech fishers bait, I own. So come on, merry men, unbelieving pagans." One men laid rough hand upon his shoulder, loud explosion. A flash smoke issued old man's square coat pocket, brigand staggered back. The rest party looked utterly amazed. What it? "An ambuscade," ejaculated one them. "No, no; came old man's coat skirt. See, smoking." There small round hole cloth, singed smelt gunpowder. "Death spy!" cried Greeks. Two brigands fell upon him, one side, lo! double explosion, loud cries pain, fell back dead. The rest brigands began recover state stupefaction sudden unexpected attack thrown them, accustomed rapid action upon emergencies present, prepared fall simultaneously upon ancient Tartar. "Oh, oh! What, think capture me, you?" he cried. In instant his feebleness dropped, lo! he appeared nimble man. Springing back six feet, he drew hands capacious pockets recently drew reader's attention, mystery revealed. Each held six-barrelled revolver. "How like music, ruffians?" cried strange man. "Oh, would I give poor friend Pike now!" Bang! Another shot, another _hors de combat._ The foremost brigands rolled over, stone dead. This warm work. But grown hot enough, suddenly appeared upon scene two men armed rifles revolvers. These two men crack shots, unluckily brigands, speedily gave proof skill. Two mountaineers bit dust could dream helping themselves. Not three minutes elapsed since firing first shot, already six men down. "Surrender!" said one new-comers, loud, authoritative voice. But instead responding, one Greeks drew pistol levelled towering figure Harkaway, course he one marksmen, he could pull trigger, bang went another chamber old man's revolver, pistol fell ground. The hand held helpless, arm shattered elbow. There truth something dreadful carnage. But neither Harkaway Jefferson thought thing this. Indeed, horrible may sound, killed brigand little compunction would slaughtered wolf. "Surrender!" cried Harkaway, second time. "Yield now, Heaven, shall die field." The Greeks looked around assistance. They five. The enemy three. As rule, ruffians deficient bulldog courage ferocity, desperate fighting surprised frightened them. "Yield, ruffians, better men yourselves." They paused. "To pause death," cried Jack Harkaway, loud voice. As last word spoken, went two rifles. "Nabley," cried American. "All right," answered disguised old man. "Look outside brigand left." "I will, his neighbour, too?" "If can." "I thinking murdered friend, Pike, I feel I take twenty vagabonds!" echoed detective, fiercely. "I will take big fellow, Jeff," said Harkaway. "You pot other." "Good." "Now, then, villains, I count three, look out," said detective, mild expletive. Not mild enough repetition here, way. "One, two--" The brigands, held hurried consultation, threw arms. Just nick time. Two seconds would chance. "Now," cried Harkaway, still gun ready use, "forward! march!" The brigands looked mischievous moment. So rifles. So revolver. These two weapons great persuaders. With slow, unwilling steps five men marched onward captivity. "I will see wounded," said detective. Four brigands killed outright. Others writhing ground using bad language. "Two four make six," muttered Mr. Nabley; "six four ten. Why, I could sworn eleven. Yes, certainly another. Where deuce could he got to?" The diligent search, is, diligent search possible circumstances, failed find faintest trace missing man. "That is one I gave smack face," said Nabley himself. "Well, I know I gave pretty warm besides that. He has not got far. He crawled somewhere die, I suppose. Well, well, I cannot deny little luxury." And then, dint threatening wounded instant death, he persuaded crawl rest. * * * * * And three adventurers marched town prisoners them, loud outcry. Cheers, bravos, huzzahs, every step way. "That is Englishman Harkaway," said one bystanders, marched onward towards prison, "and American Jefferson." "Dreadful men make enemies of. I heard Harkaway destroyed hundreds brigands pirates." "Yes, I heard so," answered other. "It evil moment villains brigands shot poor young Harkaways. They lose many life two." "Ah, will." "Who driving two wounded men him?" "That English secret police officer. He even dangerous others. He killed four men his hands skirmish. I believe old friend his murdered brigands, he sworn revenge." "It taking law hands vengeance." "All honour bravery." "Three cheers Harkaway!" CHAPTER XXXI. THE SECRET WORK GOES ON--WHO IS THE TRAITOR?--THE FALL OF A FAVOURITE--THE RECRUIT'S MUSINGS--A STRANGE REVELATION. It true. Hunston given brigands. They knew little Harkaway, little told he man make false assertion. They felt sure Hunston received money ransom boys he acknowledged, voted his doom. Under ordinary circumstances he would shot. As was, learnt terribly respect Harkaway gave his enemy preference taking law hands. Not day passed one brigands suffered hands enemy whose revenge unwisely provoked. Let go armed, support armed men within easy call watch, could avail them. They picked off, slowly, surely, quietly, mysteriously. And chief reason sought negotiate Harkaway party giving enemy Hunston. But still work went on. There one man whole band courage lay facts them. "We must move away part country," he said. "Once let us see matters turn comrades fallen hands English people, must gone." But waited fell. Several got taken prisoners, band presented thin appearance. The day trial approached brigands, Hunston one. And verdict universally foreseen. They condemned death murder two boys, Harry Girdwood young Jack. In five days executed. In court one person heard sentence greatest possible terror. This Theodora. Why affect her? It surely she could sympathy rogues murdering villains. Justice swift execution decrees here, condemned brigands doomed death within five days. "Five days!" Theodora repeated herself again, she left court. "Five days! So short. Well, I must duty come may. To-morrow may yet time--or next day." Still she sorely perplexed. "If I avow all, I shall incur undying enmity band," she reasoned; "and I keep silent, I shall murderess men--men I grown taught look upon brothers." She strange secret upon her mind troubled her sorely. In her dire perplexity she went camp, her best excite men effort behalf imperilled comrades. Pedro listened she say. Then he gave his opinion. "We clearly bound make effort save friends," he said; "we let comrades perish without attempting save them." "No, no!" answered brigands, one voice. But perhaps demonstrative last recruit joined brigands--the Englishman, known amongst his new comrades Geoffrey, discharged servant Harkaway. "When shall attempt made?" said Pedro; "that next question." "At once," said Toro. He looked around supporters; he looked vain. Toro longer good odour. His connection Hunston rendered exceedingly unpopular. He daring spirit break open murmurs, quietly he deposed; Pedro admitted leader. When question giving Hunston enemy first mooted, Toro violently opposed it; his one solitary voice lifted his old comrade. "The chance success," suggested Pedro, "is wait attack procession way execution. The prison well defended us hope success." "That is true," said Geoffrey; "and failure would ruin them." "Surely." It arranged consequently attempt made upon day appointed execution. The utmost secrecy kept plans. "Let word breathed resolves anywhere," said Pedro, "unless together council assembled, I fear traitor camp." "A traitor!" "Aye." "One more?" "One, least, would surprise occurred." "Nor either," said Geoffrey. Saying which, he glanced significantly his shoulder direction Toro. The latter, rejection his plan, stalked moodily away, walking buried bitter reflections. "Hah!" "If I could believe possible," exclaimed one brigands, "it would speedy end his rule here." Saying he drew his long dagger significantly. "Well, well," said Geoffrey, acted cautiously, satisfied unsettled minds regard Italian bravo, "let us seek traitor, found--." He left rest unsaid; knew well meant. The person quitting camp Lerna. So traitor could well carry news enemy time. "Let precaution neglected," said Pedro; "we must choose trusty sentinels. I will take watch gap myself." "Good." "Geoffrey." "Present, captain." Toro gave start reply, clearly gave death-knell his command. "Do mount guard cross roads below." "Leading fountain avenue, mean, captain?" "Yes." "Good." And shouldering his musket, he gave stiff salute marched off. "Perhaps would far look traitors," said Toro, Geoffrey disappeared, "did prejudices blind you." "Do allude Geoffrey?" asked Pedro, coldly. "Judge yourself." "Speak boldly." "I bold enough you," said Toro, passionately, "Speak presence would accuse." "I fear man here" cried Toro. "Nor man fear you." "Then thunder, he shall!" came his sword. At unmistakable demonstration several brigands made signs cutting in, Italian saw desperate game he venturing on. He saw time, brigands ready, one all, fall upon dagger sword. Gradually he fell back left them, seed sown. The words Geoffrey spoken done duty well. "So, so" muttered Geoffrey, he went; "Hunston done for, Toro shall soon follow. Thirty-two men 'dropped' dear boys--thirty-two. Gad! goodly number. They learn respect name Jack Harkaway miserable land--and rue day molested anyone us. Thirty-two--aye, rest shall follow, sure name is--Who goes there! Speak! By Heaven, stop! Nabley--just time, silence." CHAPTER XXXII. THEODORA'S ERRAND--FATAL NEWS--THE MYSTERY DEEPENS--HER RESOLVE--TO THE VILLA--INTERVIEW WITH HARKAWAY--THE VOICE FROM THE GRAVE--A HEART OF GOLD. Theodora made her way speed waterside prison, allusion previously made. The head gaoler prison daughter age Theodora. His wife nursed babes, Theodora looked upon her parents, girl her sister. To she will not appeal time trouble, she came tell her cares. She asked her foster sister, called her aside. "What now, Theodora dear?" asked gaoler's daughter, anxiously. "You look quite pale haggard." Theodora shook her head sadly. "I got involved matter I responsible." "But evil over?" "No." "As far concerned, it, dear?" "No; I say no. Are men executed murder two boys?" "And richly deserve it," exclaimed Mariana. "No, no. They deserve innocent of." "It fault theirs," retorted gaoler's daughter; "They guilty intention, least." "Well, well, Mariana. I base I could see suffer death, knowing I know--what know, fact." "But would betray me?" exclaimed gaoler's daughter, anxiously. "No, darling. The necessity danger you--to us, I may say--is entirely done away with." "What mean?" "The gallant men rescue comrades Thursday way execution." "What!" said Mariana; "Thursday!" "Yes." "Then do not know," she exclaimed, wild scared look. "Know what?" "That changed. They executed morning." Theodora gave cry terror staggered back. "No, no, Mariana," she said, wildly; "it impossible." "It true" "When made known?" "Just now." "Why altered?" "Because discovered attack meditated brigands upon way execution Thursday." "Impossible!" cried Theodora, starting up. "Why, agreed upon. I left two hours ago, came resolution." "It already known here. A messenger great Mr. Harkaway sought governor news, Mr. Harkaway all-powerful here, execution takes place to-morrow morning daybreak. It said he his spies camp brigands." Theodora clapped her hands her head, paced wildly down. "There way it, dear Mariana," she cried. "No way, way, one." "What that?" "I see Mr. Harkaway, tell all." "But ruin us all." "No. He overjoyed news I bring, I wish--all I ask repay words comfort I him." "I doubt it." "I know well," retorted Theodora. "I know his boys well believe father bad merciless suppose him. All his enmity would forgotten could he believe glad tidings I him." "Then knowledge risk lives." "No; I convinced well." "Theodora!" "Delay not. My duty points clearly that." And she could offer interfere her resolve, Theodora gone. She fled like deer. Nor she pause breath she villa. * * * * * "Mr. Harkaway see anyone," said servant. She eyed panting girl suspicion, Theodora leant support door, her left hand clasped her beating heart. The tragic events past weeks, murder Marietta Mrs. Harkaway's bedchamber, led distrust every body every thing. "I must see him," gasped Theodora. "Impossible," returned girl curtly; "call to-morrow afternoon." "Afternoon," returned Theodora. "After six morning late. It life death, I tell you. Go tell him." "Obstinate girl, I tell Mr. Harkaway serious business daybreak, gone rest, giving strictest orders he disturbed." "Call him," returned Theodora, forced calmness, "and he need go business daybreak." "Hah!" "Do hear?" The girl retreated backwards, never moving her eyes Theodora. "This hired assassin." she thought. "They cannot tackle master, knowing wary he is, hired girl deed." She thrust door, Theodora, sheer despair, burst in, cried top her voice Harkaway-- "Mr. Harkaway! Mr. Harkaway; come, come hear news poor boys, I say." At wild outcry middle his house, Jack stepped his room. "Keep back, sir; keep back," screamed servant "She is assassin." At words Harkaway slipped back his room, reappeared armed pair pistols. "Now, require, girl?" he demanded Theodora. "A words you." "Do not trust her," shrieked servant; "I saw knife her girdle. Do not trust her." Theodora smiled faintly. "I alone, unarmed," she said; "the great Mr. Harkaway, hero day here, surely afraid me." "I afraid one," returned Jack; "but I warn you, girl, treachery meditated, pistols carries man's life." "It affect me," returned Theodora, calmly. "I come bring news gladden heart, fear enmity." Her words her manner thrilled Harkaway strangely. He lowered pistols. He her shown room, followed her in. "Sit there, girl, tell all," he said, trying appear composed, he reality singularly moved. "I come, Mr. Harkaway," said Theodora, regained her calmness, "to bring welcome news ever gladdened ear--that ever sent balm comfort bruised heart." Jack turned pale; he thought he heard her speak his boys leaving his room. "Speak on," he said, his voice faltering. "Tell me, sir, could I say would restore happiness you--to wife--to friends home? What could I say lift veil mourning house hearts?--to restore former gaiety tomb-like place." Jack Harkaway listened one dream. "Girl," he said, voice almost inaudible, "you know say." "I perfectly cognisant all," she replied. "Then errand torture me?" "You wrong me." Harkaway looked her sternly face. And Theodora bore his glance without flinching. "Your manner tells me," he said, "that know better one alone could restore happiness here." "You right." And she gravely inclined her head she answered. "And know impossible," he said. "It not." "Not impossible!" ejaculated Harkaway. "Know say?" "Perfectly." "Girl, girl," cried Harkaway, passionately, "the grave give back dead." "It does--it has." Harkaway gasped breath. She speak on, ghastly pallor his countenance wild, haggard expression frightened her. "Girl, go on, tell me," he cried excitedly; "do play me." "Calm yourself, Mr. Harkaway, pray--" "Go on, go on." "You alarm me." "Speak, mercy's sake," implored Harkaway; "this suspense ten thousand times worse good bad news could bring me--are fooling me?" he added springing seizing his pistols. "No." "Speak then." "Your son Jack--" "Yes, yes; boy--my darling brave lad--what him?" The girl suddenly turned pale. "Hark," she said, "I think I hear footsteps outside; quick! window; I think watched," girl sank terror Jack's feet. Harkaway, one bound, sprang window, pistol hand, ready use. But false alarm; and, satisfied eavesdroppers, Harkaway returned his seat, girl resumed-- "Are able bear good news?" "Yes," he said, sickly smile; "the novelty would perhaps affect me--speak then--you said boy--" "Lives," answered girl. "Impossible," he faltered; "why, Harvey saw grave." "And I saw grave." "In grave!" echoed Harkaway; "and yet say live." "Yes." "Where they?" "Close hand; I wish ask return--" "All will--anything, everything--only bring back boys." "I ask save lives men unjustly accused murder, doomed die to-morrow." "Granted--why, granted unasked," said Harkaway. "Enough," said girl; "I see I may count upon you. Will come son his friend?" "Yes." He sprang greatest alacrity, sudden fancy crossed him, he seized girl shoulder. "You playing false?" said Jack. "Look face assured." He gazed long earnestly her, she bore his fixed look unflinchingly. "Yes, yes," he said, her; "you truthful--I sure that--but I will neglect precaution; head sorely perplexed told I scarcely know I asleep waking." He pressed his brow his open hands, looking carefully priming his revolvers, he started girl; issued grounds villa, he spoke his last words mistrust giving her his whole confidence. "You see, Theodora," he said, she told her name, "I do not hang back. I freely confide you." "You well." "I believe so--see confidence misplaced, shall repent it." "Your words would imply promise reward me; I seek none." "I willing believe it, still fixed resolve--" "Your fixed resolve could make take it," said girl, proudly. "I told object present mission; I other." Harkaway greatly surprised this, he stole sidelong glance her, surprise expression his face. Admiration strongly mixed it. "Tell going?" he asked presently, got clear town. "To prison water." "What for?" "They there." "But prison--how came there? In prison! Why, then, without knowing it, I probably twenty times within earshot both." "Yes." "How came there?--no half measures now. Surely time revealing all?" "And now, Mr. Harkaway, I tell walk on. The seeming mystery shall remain longer." So saying, Theodora began brief startling narrative follows--and may fairly entitled-- THE DEAD ALIVE. "Your dear son Jack his friend Harry Girdwood saved life I danger drowning sea. They brought safely ashore, fall hands remorseless companions, mountaineers. Ah, I see would call something less gentle sound. Well, planned thing. I decoy, alas! I thought little soon I repent share evil work." "Go on." "I will, end, even though learn loathe me. Well, price put heads." "Which I paid." "You paid one-fifth." "No, no; I paid all, demanded." "Hunston returned camp one hundred pounds, voted death two boys. Poor boys! brave boys. The bravest veteran battlefield never faced death heroic calmness two young heroes, sir." "Bless words, girl," exclaimed gratified Harkaway. "I proud dear boy." "I demanded release--I implored--I begged--I prayed abject terms. But felt weight hand often. They suffered much I powerless. I could obtain one small concession." "Say on, say on!" exclaimed Harkaway. "What that? I burn eagerness know dear boys." "I last sad honours noble dead. Three executed; one themselves, traitor called Lirico. By dissimulating Hunston--the viper! I tremble horror name--I obtained one concession--Lirico first suffer, boys follow." "Oh, Hunston! villain!" groaned Harkaway, "villain!" "The execution took place daybreak. I waited firing party. When wretched Lirico dealt upon, I passed round gave men drink spirit keg I specially provided. Then, feasted upon drugged spirit, I passed round reloaded muskets thought final butchery." "Well, well, torture me, girl. Quick, tell end." "Can guess?" "No, no. Quick, tell all." "In loading muskets I forgot bullets." "Ha, ha, ha!" laughed old Jack, half-hysterically. "I see now, brave girl." "The rest easy task. As men fired, fell back grave simulated death, I instructed overnight; understand I saw grave yet prove live." "I do. Girl, brave good; I know thank lives poor boys." "The night great trial, I exacted solemn promise would follow hiding place without least offer resistance." "I begin see. But contrive--" "To get secreted great prison?" "Yes." "You shall hear. My foster-sister daughter head gaoler. Her lover completely her mercy, he holds superior post prison. It condition upon I could spare brave boys' lives, forced yield." "And time might spared bitterest agony." She hung her head. "I know it, I dared speak sooner, I feared betray friends." "You may trust me," said Jack. "I know it, I saved boys." * * * * * They reached prison. "Sebastian," said Theodora, presenting Harkaway her foster-sister latter's lover, "this Mr. Harkaway." The Greek official bowed air constraint. "Theodora told all, sir?" "Yes, risked much save boys' lives." "Since I count upon forbearance," said Sebastian, "I say more. Follow presence boys." So saying, Sebastian led way stone-paved passages tower overhanging sea, cell two boys situated. At base tower jagged, sea-beaten rocks. Beside tower, half height tower, reckoning level sea, gravel terrace, covered waterproof canopy, form sort she would. And looking tower windows passed steep inner staircase, Harkaway inquired place was. "That used prison mortuary." "Those black, ugly outlines are--" "Bodies." "Ugh!" "They put black bags lieu winding sheets, placed rough wooden shells, lowered prison cemetery crane see right." "A poor look-out." But away dull thoughts. Here he threshold new joy--new life. "Your boys here," said Sebastian, pausing huge barred door. He undid fastenings, pushing open door, made way Harkaway pass in. "Enter, sir," he said. Harkaway's heart beat high. He pushed open door--entered. "Where they?" "There." A momentary pause. "There is one there," said Harkaway, tone indicative powerfully-suppressed emotion. Dire apprehensions evil stole Sebastian Theodora followed Harkaway cell. "Theodora," gasped Sebastian, staggering back, "they gone." "Where? How?" "They must escaped." "Liar!" yelled Harkaway, suddenly springing back drawing his six-shooter; "this plot. Thieves! murderers! You think fool me; shall pay penalty villainy. You injured father's grasp. Die, brigands!" CHAPTER XXXIII. YOUNG JACK AND HIS COMRADE HARRY GIRDWOOD--DEAD OR ALIVE--THE RIDDLE UNRAVELLED--THE PLAN IN CYPHER--A RELIC OF THE PAST--EUREKA!--THE CYPHER UNRAVELLED. Now young Jack. Once let us see bold young Harkaway Harry, his brave comrade. Too long absent them. Too long forced exigencies history leave, Harkaway family party generally, cruel impression two boys foully murdered, reader likewise. They lived. Aye, every word true Theodora said. Sebastian wit less truthful. When he opened door cell tower, he fully expected find two boys there. Where they? By jugglery contrived get formidable fortress place? This present chapter relate. To give clearly, however briefly, must go back day entrance gloomy prison home. Jack Harry alone. "This rum go, Jack," said Harry Girdwood. "What think it?" "Precious dull, old boy," grumbled young Harkaway. "Better grave mountain side." "It that," said young Jack. "But would not quite good sort thing meant permanent." "Growler, growler," said Harry Girdwood. "Why, I call famous diggings, hole meant us rest worms made meat us. Besides, must get away." "How?" "Escape." Young Jack looked word, his heart beat little quicker. But he said nothing. Frowning walls every side. The cell fully eighteen feet high, window close ceiling. "If want get this," said young Jack, "we must begin operations moment." "Good." "Do know, Harry, first step?" "No." "To get window." "But eighteen feet high." "Well, must reach it," said young Jack. Both boys expert gymnasts. The greasiest greasy poles vanquished either greatest ease. In stormiest weather could mount topmost parts rigging board ship. And consequence morning entrance prison found young Jack perched window, looking his comrade fellow-prisoner, giving graphic descriptions he saw there. "What is side, Jack?" "The sea, open sea, old fellow," cried Jack. "And below?" "The sea, again, old fellow." "To right?" "The sea, sea--the open sea, old fellow. Water, water, everywhere, drop drink. At least would awful _drop_ get it." "Can see thing right?" "Water only." "Is all?" "Yes--hallo!" Some thing fell. A roll thing white soft dropped Harry Girdwood's feet, he hastened pick up. Some thing white, said. Well, white, got considerably discoloured age dust, seemed indicate long shelf hiding place. Yes, hiding place. They opened bundle, found composed three slips cotton, upon written, red ink, curious things could make much of. Upon one pieces cotton certain cabalistic signs, figures, algebraical marks, geometrical figures. Upon another traced plan building. A third sectional view, drawn roughly, upon architectural principles, marked initial letters reference. "This rum go," said Harry Girdwood, laughing. Young Jack dropped his perch joined his fellow-prisoner _terra firma,_ together poured singular rags. Now young Harkaway soon lost patience, speaking contemptuously find, he proposed pitching grated window sea. "Not I," said Harry; "there is thing amuse puzzle out." "If like kill time way, Harry," answered young Jack, laughing, "no harm; there is plenty time kill dreadful dungeon." And puzzle precious treasure Harry did. The cloth upon cabalistic signs headed certain words, illegible, he managed construe. "Simple cypher, left hopes may yet serve unfortunate Englishman escape tender mercies hole." Below following figures signs-- 3. 15. 21. 14. 20.--6. 15. 21. 18.--19. 20. 15. 14. 5. 19.--21. 16.--6. 18. 15. 13.--7. 18. 15. 21. 14. 4.--20. 23. 15.--6. 15. 21. 18.--19. 9. 4. 5.--15. 6.--3. 8. 9.

So Harry Girdwood kept he knew matter himself. Upon day towards sundown, Sebastian came round bring food, Harry Girdwood said-- "We first Englishmen here, friend." Sebastian gave sharp glance, he answered-- "How know that?" "There mystery it," replied Harry Girdwood; "I saw words written pencil upon wall." "Where?" The eagerness his manner aroused curiosity boys. "Somewhere here," replied Harry, pretending seek marks upon wall. But course he found nothing. "It strange," he said, still looking about; "for I made sure hereabouts somewhere. I saw words made sure occupied Englishman once." "You right," replied Sebastian; "quite right. An Englishman named Terence Dougherty--" "That Englishman Irish," said young Jack. "Possibly; he priest. He confined long while. So long he went mad." "Mad, say?" "Yes, raving last; his madness appeared much method quite deceived head doctor." "How he deceive head doctor?" "By his apparent sanity. He mad March hare, he used rave discovered way prison." The two boys pricked ears speech. "What natural?" said Sebastian. "A prisoner always thinking he get away." "Of course." "And yet," said Sebastian, "the old priest sure he discovered way elude vigilance he chose put his plan execution; his dying words startled us." "How?" "He said doctor within twenty minutes drawing his last breath--'Doctor, think I mad. Not bit it, I tell I given life study prison breaking--getting particular cell--and, doctor, I got great commander death ordered another route. As is, I leave work benefit first Briton shall fall claws drop cell, then--mark well--he will profit work, unless he greater fool taken be, get away." "He mad," said young Harkaway. "Very." Harry Girdwood said nothing. * * * * * They alone. Young Jack full deep serious thought. Harry Girdwood arose suddenly his puzzle. "Eureka!" he cried; "I discovered it." "What?" demanded startled Jack. "The cypher. It alphabetical. Listen here." Young Jack approached. "It clear daylight," said Harry; "these figures correspond letters alphabet." _"'Count four stones ground. Two side chimney. Press underneath. See revealed it.'"_ "Hurrah!" cried young Jack. "Hurrah!" yelled Harry Girdwood; "but stop. Let us see thing it, may yet escape." CHAPTER XXXIV. WHAT THE CYPHER DID FOR THEM--THE END OF THE PASSAGE--NEARLY SAVED--BACK AGAIN--LOST--THE DEAD-HOUSE ON THE TERRACE. Four Stones up. Two across. "Do understand now, Harry?" The latter scratched his head looked about. "I understand well enough," he replied; "but one difficulty." "What?" "A tool." "Let us try hands first," said Jack. And saying, he set work try he suggested. "One, two, three, four, two up. Good! Now, Harry, lend hand here. Come." Harry Girdwood dropped one knee beside his companion together pressed stone indicated singular cypher. For moment felt effect, minute's effort found made impression. The discovery set aglow. "Once more." "Harder yet." "Of course; mind, Jack, jerking." "All right" "We must work without making noise; jerk might bring one stones clatter, would alarm guards. "Caution watchword." Soon satisfaction seeing stone revolve drop arms. Then saw beyond hole thus left open space. It pitch dark. Now, hole wall big enough one squeeze through, Harry Girdwood pushed eagerly, he perceived beyond sort tunnel small scale, roughly-hewn flight steps end it. "I see steps," said he. "Go on," said Jack, feverish eagerness. "I will; go door, Jack, listen." Jack stood eagerly watching dungeon door. Young Jack full eagerness. Harry disappeared, he could see hear him. "All right." The answer came hollow, echoing sound, indicated Harry Girdwood made considerable progress. This increased his eagerness greatly. * * * * * "Harry." No answer. He far young Jack's voice reach him. Quitting his post door, young Jack ran back hole wall, called eagerly his exploring comrade-- "Harry, Harry!" "Hullo!" "Come back, quick! I hear someone coming." "The deuce can." Back he scrambled fast narrow space would allow of, he soon cell again. "What it?" "I heard bell go iron door along passage outside. Sebastian coming." "Confound it! Look precious mess." The displacing stone left traces work. But seen danger, prepared provide it. Quick thought swept dirt, mortar, rubbish, threw hole. Then, joining hands, raised stone lifted place. At moment key turned massive half rusty lock. Sebastian entered cell, tray hand. He faintest suspicion thing wrong. "Will leave tray, Sebastian?" "Why?" "For us work appetites; none speak now." "Very good," returned man; "there harm that." "Of course not." Sebastian left room. "Thank goodness he is gone!" said young Jack, impatience see Harry next. Harry Girdwood watched door fairly closed, turned hole wall. "Come along. Follow me, Jack." "Trot on," said young Harkaway. "I am you." They scrambled hole, upon side, replaced stone. And done, cell wore original aspect. Their way lay rugged flight steps, roughly cut solid earth. The greatest care necessary avoid stumbling. At length Harry Girdwood came standstill. "Jack," he said, whisper, "Here." "Keep close now." "Right." "Nearer. Lend hand here. That is it. Now help raise stone here." "Are sure right?" "Certain." "Why?" "This exactly position stone lift away old Dougherty describes his plan." Young Jack said more, lent his aid, together shifted stone place. Then daylight peeped dark hiding-place. There something leaning opening. They pushed aside, stepping pile sacks, found covered she would overlooking sea. A place curious aspect, sign life All still gloomy-looking huge mausoleum. "I know place is," said Harry Girdwood. "What?" "It must dead-house terrace I see noted old Dougherty's plans." * * * * * While dead-house upon terrace, stirring scene enacted cell tower above, lately vacated. In fact, Jack Harkaway elder entered cell Sebastian found upon terrace. "Where now?" There several ugly-looking long boxes, whose shape uniform suggestive, standing upon tressels. Besides these, objects room she would beyond badly-filled sacks rested wall. They looked anxiously them. Nearly facing place made entrance door, tried without moment's loss time. Fast. Immovable. "The window, then," said Harry Girdwood. Back ran tip-toe window, pushing open casement, looked out. The sea. Between thirty forty feet below, lashing base prison. They turned simultaneously. "Ugh!" "No chance here." "This funny go." "Well, Jack," said Harry, ruefully, "I am glad find funny; part, I do not see joke." "Your friend, old Dougherty, did, doubt." "Do not hard poor old Dougherty," said Harry, laughingly. "It likely his plan complete, could find out." "Where it?" "In cell," said Harry; "I will go back get it." And putting aside sack, he pressed his way opening. Young Jack glanced around boxes tressels. An unpleasant feeling stole him. He relish left alone dead. He felt convinced ugly boxes contain bodies dead prisoners. "I am you, Harry," he said. After he pressed, long, narrow tunnel made old Dougherty passed. Sometimes fours; sometimes standing nearly upright. "A steps more, there," said Harry. "Hah!" "What now?" "Listen!" "I hear voices," said Harry, whisper. "This stone displace get back cell." "Then voices there?" "Yes." "By jingo!" exclaimed young Jack, "then must discovered absence already." "Of course." "How I like yell something! Would not startle little?" "Do not foolish, Jack," said his companion, uneasily. "You would ruin us." "They would never discover were. Shall I startle them?" "No. Our chance safety depends upon keeping snug." "All right." They could hear noisy tones anger, denoted something unusual occurred. "There several people there," said Harry, listening intently stone. "By Jove! I like give cheer." "Keep quiet," exclaimed Harry. "You ruin us." But, mere chance, he wrong there. Had young Jack really indulged his propensity devilment occasion, would saved many hours mental anguish bodily suffering, angry words uttered cell lately tenanted two boys spoken Jack Harkaway elder? Yes. Cruel fate playing sad trick. They actually fleeing father protector. The voice raised anger, whose echo came feebly hiding-place, his. Harkaway's. And thus loving hearts parted inches stone wall. The boys, one hand, taking confused sounds murmur enemy's voice. And moment Harkaway nearly distracted his hopes dashed rudely ground. And his anger, two lives sorely endangered. Sebastian Theodora menaced--aye, both. Harkaway could believe fooling him, he trapped view treachery. His rage, consequence, knew bounds. But must follow two brave boys. "Back go, shall captured," said Harry Girdwood. Young Jack led way back fast narrow space would permit. And soon dead-house again, groping here, presently came upon cupboard discovered number tools. "Luck last," ejaculated Harry. "Here, let us make sure two knives," said young Jack. They long-bladed weapons, something similar shape American bowie. They took one placed waist belts. They little thought singular yet immense service them. Now barely knives secreted startled sound heavy foot-falls upon stone-paved passage beyond dead-house door. "What shall now?" Young Jack stepped door, listened intently awhile. "There two people," he said his comrade, Harry, whisper. "Only two. Well, that is quite enough, I say." "Let us hide behind door," said young Jack, eagerly, "and fall upon them, make dash liberty." The steps drew nearer nearer. "Let us hide here," said Harry, pushing lid one long coffins shells. But even he so, boys started back looks horror. And why? The removal coffin lid revealed ghastly corpse, face showing last agonies dead man suffered, they, judge distorted face twisted mouth, must horrible indeed. They pushed back lid. "Ugh!" "Horrible, horrible!" gasped young Jack. The footsteps sounded nearer. They coming place, whoever was. The boys looked despair. At last moment young Jack's eye lighted upon empty sack upon ground, lying beside full ones previously alluded. "Let us get that." "Good." Harry Girdwood jumped proposition. Now sacks large, made coarse canvas, thick enough avoid falling folds, would reveal contents one glance. So, quick thought, young Jack held open Harry got in, Harry, holding sides hands, stood erect young Jack joined him. "This novel way jumping sack," said irrepressible Jack. "Hush!" "They come." A key heard grating rusty lock, boys inclined sacks look much like one pile possible, heavy door ground suddenly ajar, two ugly-looking, black-visaged men entered she would. CHAPTER XXXV. THE BLACK TRADE--A TRAFFIC IN DEATH--A PLACE OF HORROR--CAN IT BE TRUE?--TWO BOYS IN ONE SHROUD--A FIGHT WITH A SHARK--GIVING HIM THE SACK--DEEP-SEA FISHING ON A NOVEL PLAN. The two black-looking ruffians looked stealthily though good errand there. Then one listened door awhile. "You better lock door, Fleon," said one men. "What must not overlooked." "True." The boys heard door closed locked, sound seemed lock another hope them. "Now, Fleon, come here." "Well, now?" "We must come terms." "Of course, Barthes, need go far matter; terms simple enough." "You allowed forty-five francs burial, is, cost she will sheet." "No, forty only." "Well, forty; I sign register quality head gravedigger, go get money once. Besides, sacks." "You drive bargain like Jew. Keep sacks." "And drop bodies water?" "Of course." "Impossible." "Why?" "They would float." "No matter, sharks would soon take care floated." "Are agreed," cried Fleon, "for halves?" The made grumbling rejoinder, grumbling he closed proposition. "Very good, good," said Fleon, rubbing his hands. "Now let us cast up." "One, two, four, six, eight, eleven, thirteen," said Barthes. Now standing close pile sacks boys novel place concealment could hear every word, actually felt speakers brushing them. But dared speak. They even held breath. They heard, partly understood, yet could believe guessed aright. What could mean? Surely not-- No, no, no! The thought maddened boys. It horrible. Yet rest sacks contain? Besides, sacks she would these. Both boys heard conversation. Yet fearful notion felt he heard aright. They dared speak. And worst fears indeed correct. * * * * * "Hullo!" "What now?" "Thirteen." "Yes." "You wrong," said Fleon; "count again." The man obeyed. "Thirteen; I sure it." "Well, that is rum go," said Fleon. "I positive twelve." "There is baker's dozen now," said Barthes, his brutal laugh; "the merrier." "Right." "What staring at?" "I cannot make thirteenth one." "Well, I do not see that is thing weep over. Thirteen dinner awkward number, say; I dare say sharks will not object it; they are weak-minded superstitious. Ha, ha, ha!" But still Fleon could get last sack. "I have got it." "What, last sack came from?" "Yes." "Well, then, it, ease mind--not I care much, long land money." "Why, brought last one hospital fever-ward; I heard bell tolling midnight, I remember said another gone." "Why, course," said Barthes; "and see lazy beggars have not even taken trouble tie neck sack round." "That is easily done." Before boys could guess next take place, sack jerked over, rope twisted around neck sack, thus excluding nearly air. But young Jack already grown desperate, he held his knife his hand ready emergency. The jerk sent knife sack two inches, prodded Barthes hand. "Hullo!" He yelled drew back his hand "What now?" "I have cut myself." "Why, earth manage that?" "There is knife sticking sack. Let us open get out." "What for?" "It is pity throw thing sea." The boys shivered. This time could mistaking words. "Jack," whispered Harry Girdwood, "do hear?" "Yes; let us show ourselves, go back prison, or--" But he could complete his proposition, jerked sack feet. "Come, let us quick" "Good!" "Phew!" grunted Barthes; "it is precious heavy." "Heavy enough two," said Fleon. "Over it. Now, then, together word three." "One." "Two." "Three." They raised sack window ledge and-- "Oh, murder!" cried Barthes, his cheek blanching terror. "I felt something move sack." "So I," faltered Fleon. "It is alive," cried man Barthes, turning pale. "Over it, then; sharp." It poised instant, more, dizzy height. Then went. As fell, wild, despairing shriek went Heaven. A piteous cry. It cut short sharp flight air. A splash. Then still. * * * * * The two ruffians stood staring other, eyes half starting sockets. The perspiration stood big beads upon foreheads, shook like ague-stricken wretches. "Look over," said Fleon hoarse whisper. "What see?" "I see," responded other, constrained tone, "there is shark! I see his fin." "There is plenty neighbourhood." "No; he is alone, and, eye! feast he will have!" "I see him! He strikes bottom. He is got him, whether he is dead alive." CHAPTER XXXVI. A WATERY GRAVE--THE BED OF THE OCEAN--A BOLD STROKE FOR LIFE--THE RACE WITH A SHARK--A NARROW SQUEAK--HOW TO GIVE A SHARK THE SACK--THE BOAT--"FREE, FREE AS AIR!"--A STRANGE ENCOUNTER WITH A GENTLEMAN ON TWO WOODEN LEGS. Poor boys! Unhappy Jack. Luckless Harry Girdwood. The fall height water would render death almost certainty. Hand foot bound, could move. Yet stay. Could possible noble boys fall victims villainy ruffians? No. As reached bottom, two boys, momentarily deprived senses fall, partially restored shock. Instinctively knives go work. Young Jack rendered signal service. He held his knife tight grip even fell. And barely come contact bed ocean, young Jack stabbed upwards, and, single stroke, cut his way sack. At self-same instant his left hand grappled his friend trusty comrade Harry. To kick earth fiercely his feet Jack natural impulse, striking upwards, he made surface. Will he reach it? Doubtful. It seemed weary, weary way get. But water grows lighter less dense. Jack Harry see them. Both experienced swimmers divers, always keep eyes open water. And habit serves good stead, looking up, Jack perceives huge floating mass bearing upon water. Jack Harry Fleon's words, cruel jokes Barthes, still ringing ears, know, alas well means. A shark. With energy despair, boys strike out, diving lower. And moment fate seems sealed. They discover rapid movements stopped sack, got quite clear of, which, puffed, follows water progress air light. And this, miracle, saves them. The voracious monster deep strikes two boys, unwieldy body answering helm swiftness ordinary fish, shoots fairly ripped-up sack, gets huge maws entangled. A strange trap shark. A shark trapped cunning contrivance canvas sack, ripped one side. And fierce beast wallows novel trap, lashing water furiously fins, two boys gain surface water, marvelling escape. Together turn backs, gulp big draughts welcome air. Presently get breath again. "Jack, old boy, safe?" Harry's question. "For present, Harry, old chum. How feel?" "Saved, thank Heaven!" "God bless you, old man." Thus two boys, rescued complication perils, pass first moments getting gasp Heaven's fresh air. Each full thankfulness other's escape, moment thinks little himself. Suddenly young Jack reverts last danger. "Where he, monster?" he asks, great eagerness. "The shark?" "Yes." "Do not know." "Does not relish us." "Fancies shall not tender getting prison recently." Young Jack Harry jaws death, already joking. "Have got wind yet, Harry?" "Then follow me. I see sort archway prison wall, boat, I think." "Hah!" cried Harry, "I remember." And turning easily over, he shot prison wall. A strokes brought sight flight stone steps archway. And catch sight steps ahead, become conscious pursued another ravenous beasts Barthes Fleon talking cruel levity. "Quicker, Harry, quicker, old lad!" gasps young Jack. "Right; I see." Three vigorous strokes, Harry grasps chain fastened staple wall boat moored. He steps. Then grappling young Jack, he helps desperate jerk. Just time. Hardly landed hideous monster shoots past him. "Ugh! beast!" growled young Jack. And he shook his fist shark, latter, shooting past, turned round paddled leisurely back, making sure yet. But left long liberty enjoy shark's disappointment, startled great noise commotion going forward prison. Young Jack looked inquiringly his companion. "Our absence discovered?" "I suppose so. Let us make tracks soon can." With set work loosen boat. It took little time force padlock held chain staple, together accomplished it. Then, lowering sculls, pushed sea. "Free," murmured young Jack, exultantly; "free last." "Do not fast" Now took scull, long, deep strokes pulled safe part coast. Wind tide favour, shot water racing pace. "Pull round; here is place. Now it." "Both together," said Harry Girdwood, excitedly. Three long, vigorous strokes, boat ground far high dry upon shingle. They ran wildly. And villa sight, fact made increase speed. Ah, young hearts beat sight it. "Will not surprised?" "And pleased." "And shall not we? Ah, me! Hello! who is coming here? Why, blow me, Harry, see is?" "Of course; it is old King Mole." "Mr. Mole, Mr. Mole, Mr. Mole!" yelled out. "Here safe back!" The old gentleman staggered back sheer amazement. "Is possible?" he exclaimed. "Surely--yet, no; cannot be." "Cannot though?" And put doubt rest, seized hold hand nearly dragged his frail supports. CHAPTER XXXVII. RESTORED--GENERAL REJOICINGS--HOW MR. MOLE WAS CRUELLY MALIGNED--FATHER AND SON--THE DEATH KNELL AND THE REPRIEVE--"SOON WE WEIGH ANCHOR"--GOODBYE TO GREECE. "Mrs. Harkaway?" "Who is there?" "Me; obsequious humble command." "Good gracious!" And upon side door Mrs. Harkaway heard whisper-- "It is Mr. Mole. I declare he quite tipsy." "You right there, dear Mrs. Harkaway," responded gallant Isaac; "more tipsy--obfuscated, groggy--excuse slangy phrase--tight--not liquor, yet full spirits--figuratively speaking." "Whatever he talking about?" muttered Mrs. Harkaway. "About introducing young gentleman you," replied Mole, overheard every word, overjoyed recent events take umbrage thing now. "Excuse now, Mr. Mole," replied lady, "I--I dressing." "Humph!" Young Jack bursting impatience push aside rush his mother's arms. But Mr. Mole restrained him. "The young gentleman I would introduce, dear Mrs. Harkaway, brings us news young Jack." "Hah!" A cry joy, delight, anxiety, fear, hope, commingled, burst mother young hero. The door opened, Mrs. Harkaway stood upon threshold. She stared confusedly two boys. "Mother!" "Jack!" No more. In moment locked other's arms. "Oh, Jack, Jack!" exclaimed astonished mother. "Where been? Now come back, I may tell I feared I never see again." Jack's eyes filled tears. He kissed her tenderly held his hand Harry. "Here, mother dear," he said; "there sweet little cherub sits aloft keep watch life poor Jack--and Harry cherub." "Hush! Jack." "I shall not hush, Harry; know it is true. You cherub, know it. Why, mother, it is over, I here, I must tell I never had not Harry." "Bless you, Harry," said Mrs. Harkaway, squeezing his hand. Just then, Mr. Mole, felt tingling sensation nose, fearing he disgrace his manly reputation tear, retired, came stumping back news. "Here comes Jack--old Jack, I mean. Here is luck us." A well-known footstep heard, Jack Harkaway entered room. As his eye fell upon Harry Girdwood, he started back, colour forsook his cheek. Then he caught sight his boy, he gave cry delight he held open his arms. Young Jack flew "Come here, Harry," cried Harkaway; "here, boy--for second son me." And two boys soon locked his arms. For minutes word spoken. His heart full speech, whilst thus engaged--engrossed happiness--a deep sound heard. A dismal, moaning sound. A bell sounded like distant funeral knell. What it? Harkaway started mournful sound. "Hark!" he exclaimed. "Do hear that?" "Yes." "What it?" "An execution." "Where?" "At prison." "Of whom?" "The brigands." "The villains earned fates right well." "Yes, yes," exclaimed Jack Harkaway, hurriedly; "but execution must take place, though Tomaso shot yesterday." "Tomaso, brigand," cried young Jack, "then rest brigands." "Why? Because unjust, men condemned suffer death sentenced murdering you, boys." As word uttered, loud commotion, Theodora burst room. She gave cry seeing two boys, rushed joyfully Harry Girdwood. "Thank Heaven safe," she said hysterically; "but brave boy, hear? Do know bell sounds death-knell men who, bad wicked are, wrongfully condemned?" "I know." "Yes, girl," said Harkaway; "we know--but yet time save them. Come on, prison." They left precipitately, brief space time prison brigands respited. As young Jack said, earned full penalty law. But would upon consciences lawless ruffians suffer crime committed. "There one strange fact this," said governor prison Harkaway, "and is, one prisoners taken liberty respiting himself." "Which one?" "The Englishman Hunston." "What, Hunston escaped!" "Impossible." "Indeed not." "But how?--when? Why Hunston others?" "We give guess," said governor, "but good one. His gaoler disappeared him; rest difficult matter guess." It quite true. Hunston, Harkaway's old schoolfellow bitter foe, contrived elude justice. Both disappeared--prisoner gaoler him. "I am sorry that," said Harkaway, "for would good thing take care double-dyed traitor, matter, shall nothing fear now; enough place." "Are we, then, leave Greece, dad?" "Yes, preparations made, days, weigh anchor get away romantic Greece, precious scoundrels brigands." CHAPTER XXXVIII. THE LAST OF THE BRIGAND BAND--HUNSTON'S PERIL--HIS WANDERINGS--STARVATION IN THE MIDST OF PLENTY--ON THE LANDING STAGE AT NIGHT--AN ADVENTURE. And band? Where it? The fear-stricken remaining formidable host hid recesses mountains, lurking, like thieves miscreants were, retired nooks crannies. And lives grew wretched. Their famous recruit, Geoffrey, famous hand bringing plunder every day, disappeared. And disappeared booty he brought them. Altogether, therefore, Geoffrey much advantage first supposed. And disappearance Geoffrey, sham brigand, chronicle sudden return old friend, Dick Harvey, his beloved Harkaways. And Toro, giant brigand? He completely lost sight awhile. No one knew become him. Hunston's first care getting free prison get mountain fastnesses, search his old comrade, Toro. But he could discover least trace his old comrade. He skulked night fled sleep mountains day, shrinking echo his footfalls--starting his shadow. "My curses light upon Harkaways one all," speech ever upon his tongue; "they bane--my curse life." He resolved get away place. Yes; he would fly. But how? Here he well-nigh starving midst plenty, possessed sum money small fortune land, yet he dare change part it. This life grew unendurable, he resolved hazards change it. Yes; he would get away place once. Soon dusk, he ventured, well disguised, town water side, lolling about, he soon chanced hear something greatly interested him. A group French sailors smoking, gossiping upon subject caught his attention soon he heard name mentioned. Harkaway. "Yes; Mr. Harkaway friends going away tomorrow," said one sailors, appeared petty officer. "I shall come see ladies go board," said one sailors. "No, will not," laughed former speaker. "Why not?" "You are late." "They are board already, surely?" "Indeed, are." "They start early." "They weigh anchor daybreak, I hear." "Ah, well," said sailor, joining in; "they will miss Monsieur Harkaway here, he is rich Croesus." "Or Monte Christo," said another, laughingly. "Aye, he is," said another sailor. "I ladies went board, I lucky enough able render little service Madam Harkaway." "What it?" "It worth repeating," replied modest Gallic tar. "All I know is, Monsieur Harkaway made fuss he would insist upon going board drink health." "And went?" "Yes; swam good wine. And I came away, pockets full cigars money stand treat round." "What splendid fellow Monsieur Harkaway is." "Aye, he is." And amidst words praise Hunston slunk away, gnashing his teeth rage bitterness. "Hang him!" he muttered; "his old brag ostentation caught fools! I wonder his vessel is? If I could fire torpedo send young Jack boy gone to, I should not dull moment rest life." And ruffian chuckled maliciously. "Ah, I one them," he muttered, "when I precious boy Harry Girdwood shot like dogs were. Ah! grand. Those crumbs comfort." And rubbing his hands chuckling, he rambled on. He paused presently upon coming long, wooden landing stage, jutting long way sea. Arrived head jetty, he looked earnestly seaward, endeavour trace many ships offing could Harkaways' vessel. "Well, well," he murmured himself, "I do not care much, I do not see I could I knew it. I could send blessing straight it--hah, hah! But Harkaway's departure, I breathe freely. I get weeks quietly, dust he kicked blow over, I live quietly upon his money like gentleman, I decide upon next step." While he sat thus looking sea, his attention suddenly attracted shorewards. "Confusion!" he ejaculated, starting up; "there is someone coming along jetty." It true. Two sailors woman came sauntering along landing stage, chatting came. There barely room four abreast upon narrow wooden pier, consequently might recognize him, providing heard description him. "What ass I come here," muttered Hunston; "to drive corner." He looked round. They appear notice him. Not yet least. So he crouched down, lowered boat, moored one end piles. Beneath end jetty series crossbars beams, resting upon low range piles, indeed served main foundation whole structure. So Hunston clambered nimbly boat species scaffolding. Here he lay full length, listening approach three people. * * * * * "You better come ashore now, miss," said one sailors. "No, no," replied Mrs. Harkaway's new maid. "But you will never time go bed all." "Oh, yes, Mistaire Saileur, I get hour I like; I shall go board three of the clock," said wilful girl. "I shall get seasickness quite early enough, I know. Besides, I do not like water dark." "The moon directly." Jack Tiller right. The moon burst thick cloud, shot ray silvery light upon spot girl kneeling. It fell across living face flooring jetty. A face rendered ghastly white action moonlight, eyes upturned eagerness expectation. A startling sight. A weird ghastly object come suddenly strongest nerve. She started back, sprang her feet. Then, piercing shriek, she fled. The sailors looked aghast, staring explanations. "Let us her, Jack!" cried one; "she will overboard double quick she fouls agin blessed bulwarks. It is rotten tinder." Off ran, tried could bring girl back. But she scare she would hear it. She seen man hiding there. "Bah!" cried Jack Tiller, "why man hide away us?" "Yes, that is it, miss, why?" "I do not care, I know man. I knew face. I seen madame's book photographs." "The dooce did." "Who it?" "One brigands. The likeness taken prison." This made gallant tars laugh again. "That is natural bogey hereabouts," said Joe Basalt; "damme I believe half yarns brigands." "Nor I neither." And so, failing persuade girl go board then, went back jetty, dropped boat, and, unlocking it, rowed sea. CHAPTER XXXIX. A TRIP BY WATER--BOAT, AHOY!--A COMPACT FOR MONEY--THE STOWAWAY ON BOARD THE "WESTWARD HO!"--HIS VISION--IN THE HANDS OF THE PHILISTINES. Hunston overheard every word uttered. The full sense his danger flashed across him. He watched, he felt sure. "Not yet," said Hunston himself, "not yet. Sooner let get hold me, I would lay bones bottom sea." With intention he dropped water. But he even touch bottom, he got far under, he struck out, taking dozen strokes; water, he came surface. "That is another narrow squeak," he said himself, he took deep draught air. "The last time I swim Cuba, narrow squeak too." He rescued memorable occasion his enemy, Jack Harkaway himself. "Well, squares old account," he said, turning his back float. "He saved last time. He is time take risk." He began look anxiously him. There boat great distance rowed two men, Hunston thought signalling them. "Suppose wretched Greeks, recognise me?" He gave up. But he could hardly keep afloat now. What recognise him? Would give up? Perhaps. Well, worst could take his life his misdeeds, his life sore jeopardy now. So he resolved hail men boat. * * * * * "Boat ahoy!" "Hullo!" "Man overboard!" The signal sinking man caught quick ears two men boat, pulled towards double quick. Hunston caught hold side boat. "This arm. Catch armpit. There; thanks. I have hurt other." Barely rescued jaws death, yet his coolness presence mind come back him. In trice he lying bottom boat, panting waiting recover his breath renew his thanks service. "Why, mounseer, speak English," said one sailors. Hunston nodded. "I English." "So we." "I guessed much," retorted Hunston, "by way pulled help poor devil. It nearly me." "Just time. Well, that is one us, messmate." "Yes, you will find I am able reward something solid thanks." "Get along; mate do not save lives much 'ed." "I believe you," said Hunston, "but I villain I something handsome I could." "I tell what, mate, shall lug mate water." "When get chance," laughed other. "Jes' so." "How came there, though?" demanded former sailor, suddenly. "It is long story," said Hunston, taking breath, thinking good plausible "whacker"; "so I will tell without details." "Do." "There is rich powerful man place, lovely wife. Well, lady--" "Casts sheep's eyes you." "Ha, ha!" "Well, it," returned Hunston, laughingly. "It is fault mine. I am sure I never encouraged her. But her husband precious jealous, consequence he got sea boat gang murderers--" "The swabs!" "Marlinspikes grampuses!" cried other. "They going practise curious trick upon me. It institution neighbours masters, Turks, call bowstring." "D--n fiddling," ejaculated one sailors; "I would like  them awhile. I would bowstring  them show  them black eyes, good old English fisticuffs mean." "I do not think would care instructed that," said Hunston. "I would, I would--" "Let gentleman go on," said other. "Well, fact is, I got out, jumped overboard capsized boat struggling, them, I dare say, gone bottom." "Hurrah!" shouted one sailors. "Hurrah!" "I hope finished lot swabs." "I do not think that. But anyhow, I would give trifle I could get clear place." "I tell it" "You can?" "Yes." "That is jolly." "Easily done." And sailor suggested bringing aboard ship introducing skipper. Hunston listened shook his head. "What," exclaimed sailor, "will not do?" "No." "Why?" "I will tell you; blessed outcry would raised, skipper would forced give tried." "Well, would dare play false." "Not British man-of-war harbour; nothing short would prevent villains thing liked me. They would go mockery trial me, I condemned death beforehand." "The wampires." "Wuss wuss, wampires, Joe," said sailor, wagging his head gravely. "There one way get scrape," said Hunston. "Out then." "Why, earn forty pounds apiece stow away board hold, anywhere, sea," said fugitive. The two sailors looked hard other. "Cannot it." "No." "Why not?" "Unpossible." "I will tell not. Our skipper best commander afloat, on'y he will not nonsense. We dare not it, dare not." "Right, Joe." "Now, harkye, messmates," said Hunston. "I am man get man fail his duty; I would not insult mentioning it. But mark words, skipper would first man approve act." They shook heads. "Not he." "I know he would, say right; only, d'ye see, he would think his duty give fair trial. Well, would result that? Why, soon set sail, they would liked me, you would never hear world, whereas I concealed unknown skipper, he would glad afterwards good action done board his ship without his failed his duty." They listened this, listening lost. That night Hunston slept hold ship, two sailors contrived smuggle board greatest secrecy. It difficult task them, indeed sailors well earned money he gave them. Not soul board ship, exception two sailors, least idea his presence there. They contrived make snug hiding-place behind barrels sugar salt pork. And brought food turn turn about. And he chuckled day night way he defeated his enemies, escaped Greek justice. * * * * * For three days three nights he lay snug quiet. This prudent course. But long third night over, Hunston grown weary heartsick close confinement. He sharp attack blues. He got drink sailors drank heavily kill dull care, defeated end. He fell heavy sleep dreamt sorts terrible things. He thought without knowing he fallen power Harkaways again; flying he suddenly, he thought miles away imminent danger, fallen arms. And went his alarming dream, his worst enemies assembled judgment him. Jack Harkaway, Harvey, Jefferson, together, his judges, latter places suddenly taken three visitors world. These Harry Girdwood, young Jack, oh, horror! Robert Emmerson, his murdered friend. His three visitors. And three threatened put tortures unimaginable, he raved, stormed, wept turns; then, broken body spirit, he prostrated begged kill him, horrible phase his vision he groaned loudly he awoke, find perspiration pouring regular bath. He quivering like one suddenly stricken ague. Not inch his body free fearful palsy. "Oh, would I give light now!" he thought; "will never come?" Yes. What that? Merciful powers! his prayer seemed answered. He saw faint glimmering light Yes, coming way. What relief! He drew long, long sigh. The light stopped suddenly. Then shaded part hold he hiding. What could mean? Silence around him. He stretched forward ascertain light, he saw froze marrow his bones fright. The light reflected upon young, handsome face he knew well--so real, vivid, lifelike. The face, too, deathly hue grave upon it. It young Jack's face, looking Hunston's frightened eyes pale death. Hunston stared; his optics dilated appeared ready start sockets. He gasped, made effort articulate, his senses forsook him, he became unconscious. CHAPTER XL. HUNSTON'S PERIL--BLACK VISIONS--A DREAM OF VENGEANCE--AN UNKNOWN DANGER TO THE "WESTWARD HO!" An explanation foregoing scarcely necessary, believe. You bear mind, course, Hunston utterly ignorant miraculous escape his destined victims--young Jack Harry Girdwood. You must bear mind, too, although you, friend reader, may give shrewd guess truth, Hunston remotest notion he was. This said, may perhaps understand fearful effect waking vision upon guilty wretch. Bear mind he lurking close stifling hold, single ray sunlight penetrated, three whole days--three long nights. Unwelcome conscience tapped would deceived. A man guilt Hunston upon his mind could afford alone--nay, dark either. * * * * * When he recovered consciousness, his first sensations burning throat, opening his eyes, he found cared tenderly one sailors brought there. "Come, come, I say, mister," said honest tar, bit fright finding Hunston's condition, "this will not do, know." "I better now," murmured Hunston, faintly. "You little, precious little. You come deck now, chance skipper says job." "Yes, yes; I will," said Hunston, waking up. "He cannot kill us." "Nor eat me," said stowaway, sickly smile. "Not he." "Any thing better remaining longer here. I believe I die I did." "Then come once, sure name's Jack Tiller." "Tell me, friend," Hunston said; "whither bound?" "For Red Sea." "Pheugh! A long cruise?" "Well, yes." "And going yet, travel touch coast Australy." "The deuce!" "That is it, sir." "What is name vessel?" The sailor laughed. "What makes grin?" "Why, I wondering, messmate, never asked before." "My thoughts full getting away." "Ah, course." "What her name?" "The 'Westward Ho!' She formerly 'Seamew,' owner rechristened her." "What is his name?" "The skipper's? Why, captain John Willoughby." "The owner's?" "Mr. Jack Harkaway." Had thunderbolt dropped hold them, Hunston could astonished. "What?" His tone startled sailor. He saw it, he his utmost calm himself. "Who say?" "Who?" echoed sailor. "Why, Mr. Jack Harkaway? He is well known enough. Surely do not mean go say never heard him?" "I--I think I heard name," muttered Hunston. "Think! Well, I, unless you have shut solitary confinement last fifteen years. Blow tight, man had not heard Mr. Jack Harkaway, would living curiosity." "Jack Harkaway owner ship!" Hunston murmured, like one dream, relapsed silence more. No wonder he seen vision. No wonder spirit murdered boy, young Jack, hover vessel his destroyer hiding--in his father, mother, he held dear life journeying. The situation grew graver ever. It truly alarming plight, he thought over, desperate he become. "Jack Tiller," said he. "Your honour." "I will stay I am." "Oh, good," replied tar; "mum's word. I thought berth was not cheerful." Jack Tiller gave hoist his slacks, something sigh grunt, he wheeled round went deck. * * * * * "If I could see way this, I like better thing fire ship," said Hunston, himself; "fire watch close by, chuckling roasted. What glorious return would them. By powers, thing I could wipe once, all, all! Jack, Harvey, Emily, Yankee braggart--curse him!" And Hunston sat brooding black evil-smelling hold day day. The companion his solitude his dark thoughts, his vicious resolves vengeance. "It cursed ill-luck," he would say again, "to beholden Harkaway life. Why, even now, he saved again, saved spite himself. That is merry side question." Merry was, never made smile. One dreadful thought filled his poor mind. One fearful fancy took complete possession him, day night he brooding it. "Once let see clear landing," he would mutter himself, "once let see way straight get ashore safe place, I will make 'Westward Ho!' hot hold them. Too hot--ah, yes, precious deal hot hold them, I would; I would make blaze would never able extinguish." And he began devoting arrangements villainous purpose. What more, he got his plans mapped out, ready execution diabolical deed. Little happy passengers "Westward Ho!" dream fatal danger threatening them. They would enjoyed many sweet slumbers, could faintest inkling truth--if suspected near villain Hunston, following deadly purpose revenge, seemed increased year year ever since schooldays Jack Harkaway. CHAPTER XLI. YOUNG JACK'S CONFIDENCES--HOW TWO INNOCENT CONSPIRATORS REPENTED--A CHANCE SHOT STRIKES HOME. "Harry," said young Jack, walked deck arm arm, "I must tell something upon mind days past." Harry Girdwood turned round. Young Jack's serious manner impressed him. "What it, Jack?" "I know you will laugh," began Jack. "Do you, Jack?" returned Harry Girdwood, promptly; "that case, tell once. I like laugh, know." "Well, Harry, has not made laugh. I lolling half drowsily hatchway there, evening, I suppose I dropped asleep, I dreamt Hunston. I dreamt I going ugly scene again, thick dream, something woke me." "Yes." "What think was?" "Cannot say." "Hunston's voice, moaning, groaning pain apparently." Harry Girdwood opened his eyes wonder singular speech. "What talking about?" "Nonsense, rubbish; not? So I thought since. But know sort dream wake vivid effect vision strongly upon you, dream-drama appears continue you are awake?" "Yes." "Well, exactly happened me. I heard Hunston I awake." There something strangely impressive his manner he said this, caught Harry Girdwood's attention spite himself. "Fancy," he said, assumption indifference he far feeling; "fancy, dear Jack." "Of course," answered young Jack; "but strange." "Not exactly strange, either, every thing considered, gone through. Why, Jack, hardly believe I tell I scarcely sleep without dreaming Hunston. And wonderful that, taken place? It enough shake strongest nerves, startle bravest man ever lived." "You allude attempted execution ourselves?" said young Jack. "Yes; spite brave brigand girl's assurances, great danger stood upon brink grave firing party aiming us." "I felt good deal confidence her," said Jack, "but I could not help thinking accident her calculations might happen easily." "That is true. Supposing one bullets left in?" "Why, one us would food worms now, unless wolves bears rooted us graves made dinner us; I have not told vision yet, Harry." "Did dream again?" "No." "What you, then, tell? Out it. What else it?" "The moans I heard grew distinct I listened, I followed sounds--" "In sleep?" "No, awake. I followed sounds hold." "Well?" "They plainer heard there. I pushed way barrels boxes, nosed corners bull's eye lantern, suddenly I heard half-suppressed cry, violent gasp rather, someone suddenly found edge precipice, seen ghost." "Well, well." "Well, moment hand placed upon arm." "Yes." "I started back drew dirk, I found self attacking--" "Mole?" "No. Joe Basalt." Harry Girdwood burst laughing this. "So Joe Basalt hiding lark while?" "I did not say so," replied young Jack, thoughtfully. "Why, then, what, name that is wonderful, think could been?" "I do not know, Joe Basalt chaffed me. He swore I walking sleep; I come back upon old opinion since I thought job over." "You mean actually believe someone concealed hold?" "Is--or was. Now, watch Joe Basalt, Harry, see thing strange his manner." "I will, like, but--good-morning, Tiller." This Jack Tiller, came touching his forelock. "Good-morning, Master Jack--morning, Master Harry. We have got fishing party on, gentlemen, thought might like jine us." "Who is going?" "Me Sam Mason, Tommy Shipwright Bill Adams, Joe Basalt old Higgy--only lot among common folk," added he, grin. "And among superior class?" asked young Jack, laughingly. "Mr. Mole." "What, Mr. Mole! Why, earth he going for?" "That is exactly p'int it, young gentlemen," "How so?" "We are going a-fishing something new-fangled Mr. Mole inwented." The two boys looked grinned. "Larks on, Jack," said Harry Girdwood. "I am it, one." "And I too." "That is sort," cried Joe Basalt. "Mr. Harvey's going, too, Mr. Jefferson; I go Mr. Harkaway ask his consent." And Joe left singing-- "Avast!" cries Jack, "do suppose I are not man dooty knows? For liberty afore goes To ax skipper I propose." And well-disciplined sailor went Harkaway's cabin broached question. "All right, Basalt," said Harkaway; "only look sharp young gentlemen; know boys get mischief." "All right, honour; trust me." "I do, Joe Basalt," responded Harkaway; "I do, I know never straighter truer man ever trod deck are." "Come, I say, honour," remonstrated Joe Basalt, modestly, "draw mild." "No deceit you, I know it; nothing underhand Joe Basalt." A sudden thought flashed sailor's head, brought unpleasant reminder. With came flush his bronzed face. He touched his forelock respectfully Harkaway ran stairs. As he went he muttered himself-- "I felt like miserable swab!" he muttered; "a d--d, deceitful son sea-cook--that is are, Joe Basalt, I wish I would never nothing precious stowaway." CHAPTER XLII. SHARK-FISHING--BILLY LONGBOW'S YARNS--TELL THAT TO THE MARINES--A NOVEL BAIT--HOW MR. MOLE HAD THE LAUGH HIS OWN WAY. The fishing expedition consisted two boat-loads. To wit, pinnace cutter. In former Jefferson, Dick Harvey four sailors. In cutter young Jack, Harry Girdwood, Mr. Mole, Joe Basalt, Sam Mason, Jack Tiller. "Now Jack," said Mr. Mole, settling comfortably rudder lines; "and too, dear Harry, know, course, going shark-fishing. You understand is?" "I know shark is, mean that," answered young Jack. "Rather," said Harry, shudder old recollections "we white one us once." "A white shark!" said Mr. Mole, beaming upon boat's crew generally. "_Squalus Carcharias,_ worst family." "They are not got families, axing pardon, Mr. Mole, sir," said Joe Basalt, "for eats mothers fathers children likewise." "Why, Bill Longbow told yarn once, honour," said Sam Mason, "about white shark. I mean," he added, nodding Mr. Mole respectfully, "a squally cockylorium--a blessed rum name shark--as devoured his family dinner, supped Sunday school pleasure-trip steamboat, a-going wind meal his blessed self, his dexter fin stuck his swaller, he brought hisself ag'in." A general laugh greeted sally. So boisterous mirth, caught occupants boat. "That is Sam Mason one his Billy Longbow's yarns," cried sailor pinnace. "So white shark water," said Mr. Mole. "Rather unpleasant that." "It indeed unpleasant close quarters," said Harry Girdwood. "Very close?" demanded Mr. Mole. "Not than--" "Than squally cockylorium now, honour," cried Sam Mason, pointing behind Mole. The old gentleman looked quickly behind them, there, paddling stern, monstrous white shark. Mr. Mole slid his seat bottom boat wonderful celerity. "Do not like look him?" said young Jack. "Ho! I will tackle presently, I--I slipped down," said Mr. Mole. "So I see, sir." "And I mean show novel sport way shark-fishing," said old gentleman. "You?" "Yes." He brought large hamper him, he proceeded unpack, occupants boat looking great interest business. "Billy Longbow told yarn once," said irrepressible Sam Mason, "about wooden-legged nigger." Mr. Mole looked up. "What?" "A wooden-legged nigger," said Sam Mason, touching his forelock respectfully Mole. "No offence, honour, legs." "Oh, no." "Go on, Sam," said young Jack, laughing; "out Billy Longbow's yarn." "This nigger stumping along banks Nile one day, he meet blessed big crockydile hundred feet long." "Oh!" "Draw mild, Sam." "Well, that is Billy Longbow said--a hundred feet long." "Oh, damme!" cried Joe Basalt, "make ninety-nine, Sam, decency sake." "I will not give half foot," persisted Sam. "Well, Snowball sees Muster Crockydile near getting way, he says--'You jist wait bit, Massa Crock, I will gib yar suffin sniff at.' An' so, without ado, he unscrews one his wooden legs, walks animal's jaws." "Oh, oh, oh!" A general groan incredulity. "Absurd," said Mr. Mole, without looking his task watching, case shark show itself. "A fact, sir," said Sam Mason. "Well, he holds his wooden leg perpendicular greedy crock comes snap, wooden leg trifle he could get over; stuck propped his great ugly maws wide open; crawls Snowball, kind sorter modern Jonah, none worse it." "Bravo, Sam!" "Ho! quite true, it is Billy Longbow's version it," said modest Sam. "And all?" "Not quite. He squatted upon his stump, prodded crock eye wooden leg he caved in." "Oh, oh, oh! Sam, Sam!" cried chorus. By time laugh subsided, Mr. Mole ready his novel fishing-apparatus. Novel, indeed. He took soda water bottle, filled gunpowder tightly corked, cork twisted wire attached line. The end line small square box, furnished four handles, similar barrel organ. One handles pay line, another winding in. "And two?" demanded Harry Girdwood. "Simple enough," said Mr. Mole; "this box battery, line conductor goes cork powder. When I feel tug, turn two handle sends spark powder, friend _Squalus Carcharias_ gets good deal he time digest." "I begin see." "Really, great plan, Mr. Mole." "Now pork." "Pork!" "Yes." He provided large morsel fat flat strip, he proceeded tie round soda water bottle twine. When done, he put thirty feet his telegraphic line, hurled his novel bait sea. They looked eagerly direction, saw great sea-monster dive swiftly it. Then huge carcase clearly perceived limpid water turning over. Mole waited moment. The line tightened. "Now it." He gave two his handles several vicious twists. There shock, kind water spout far off. Mole chuckled quietly, wound his line. "Do think succeeded?" demanded young Jack, anxiously. "Do I think, I know? Of course has." They watched place eagerly, space minutes carcase huge white shark, completely rent asunder, rose surface water, floated about. "Damme!" ejaculated Joe Basalt, "if are not queerest fishing I ever come nigh." "And are not Mr. Mole best fisherman ever see?" "That he is." "Let us give cheer; hip, hip, hip!" "Hurrah!" And towed vanquished shark alongside "Westward Ho!" Isaac Mole became hero day. CHAPTER XLIII. MORE DEEDS OF DARING--HOW JEFFERSON SHOWED UP IN AN EMERGENCY--SINGLE COMBAT AND ITS RESULT--MR. MOLE TO THE FORE WITH A FRESH FEAT ON THE LONGBOW. "They have got bite cutter," said Parry. They had, seemed strong one. They got Tartar. A big fish hooked, dragging boat water furious rate. "We must go lend hand," said young Jack. They laid work, soon upon scene strife. Aye, strife correct expression. Strife was. A steam tug could dragged along better pace, made resistance hopeless. "Pull hard." "Aye, aye, sir!" "Lay it, lads," cried old Mole, excitedly; "look flying water." "Aye, aye, sir!" "I remember Billy Longbow once," began Mason. "Hang Billy Longbow now!" said Joe Basalt. "Yes, let us bag fish first then--" "Are not Mr. Mole got another his soda water bottles?" "Lots bait," replied Mr. Mole; "but tackle is not mark." "Now he is slackening." "Yes--he is getting blown." "Now he rises." So he did. As spoke, flight cutter checked, huge shark rose surface water air. A couple fowling pieces gave warm greeting, without appearing damage much. The pinnace pulled sharply round, young Jack, standing head boat, held harpoon ready use within reach. The moment soon found. The harpoon flew his grasp whizzing air, struck quarry. Tough his hide was, harpoon would denied admission. The shark snorted struck, dived down, down, line grew taut. Had single line hold voracious monster check, would little use, violent struggle, desperately sudden strain. But two lines worked well together now. Much shark objected company, he choice cruise within comparatively narrow limits his tether. "Beast!" said Dick Harvey, snapping pistol rose surface. "You take thundering lot killing." "This must settled," said Jefferson. "How?" "I will show you," returned Yankee, promptly. He drew his bowie, watching shark intently moment, he sprang boat's side sea. A cry horror arose one all. What could mean? Suicide--the maddest suicide ever man contemplated. Nothing could save now. Nothing. "Jefferson!" ejaculated Harvey. "Hush!" cried one sailors, suppressed excitement; "do not worrit. Let chance shark rate." It wanted bold fellow deed this, Jefferson bold fellow, bolder. He braggart; his self-confidence amazing, brought many many desperate strait. Would bring present affair? Doubtful--sadly doubtful, indeed. The wounded shark caught sight intrepid American, heedless hurts, dived him. The spectators held breaths. Jefferson rose surface instant, drew long breath, he plunged again. Barely he came shark snorting, puffing, blowing. There momentary pause then. Then huge tail lashed water foam rolled over, water surrounding crimsoned life blood. "That is another gone coon," said Sam Mason exultingly. As he spoke, Jefferson shot boat's side, half dozen eager hands dragged in. "Phew!" he said, shaking water his face head, "that beast cost knife cutlass." He sheathed shark ugly beast done with. The spectators gave cheer. "That is sharp work, Jack," said Harry Girdwood. "Sharp, indeed." "It wants quick hand sharp eye." "And got it, too, there," said Isaac Mole, enthusiastically; "the smartest performance I have seen many long day." Jefferson nodded smiled speaker. "Thank'ee, Mr. Mole," said he; "such praise indeed gratifying coming you, real hero day." Mr. Mole radiant smiles this. "Jefferson," said old gentleman, his condescending patronising manner, "you remind best days." The boat's crew generally laughed this. But Mr. Mole abashed. "Really, Mr. Mole," said Jefferson, "you flatter." "Not I," protested Mr. Mole; "I rarely remember neater thing myself." "Indeed!" "Truly." "Is possible?" "What magnanimity!" "Humility itself," ejaculated another. The exaggeration expressions wonderment well admiration upset Mr. Mole's moral equilibrium. He large swallow admiration, he pleased take his legitimate due. "The thing compare Mr. Jefferson's gallant deed adventure I tell of," said he, modestly. "I whaling expedition north----" "Whaling?" "You!" "Yes, yes, I, Jack. What surprising that?" "Nothing, sir," responded young Jack; "only I aware ever done thing line." "Now, expect know past career, dear boy?" "Of course, sir." "Whaling, I repeat. We chasing enormous spermaceti whale. I carrying harpoon tackle, got within range I let fly force. Now, perhaps I ought say it, many men could approach handling harpoon. I spitted animal clean middle." "Dear me!" "No sooner he feel struck he sounded. Out went line, hang I could pay fast enough, he jerked clean perch water." "Dreadful!" "Shocking!" Mr. Mole smiled grimly. "Not bad sounds, all," he said. "It startled bit, may suppose." "It would, course," said Dick, tipping wink Jefferson. "But I got back presence mind half crack, I hauled line I found whale's back. There I stuck like grim death, jobbing stabbing away one hand, I held hilt harpoon other. I dirk short sword me, quite long enough whale." "No doubt, doubt," exclaimed Dick. "In minutes I jobbed go him, he floated top water dead bloater, top, rather blown long water, excepted, much worse it." "Wonderful!" "Marvellous!" "A miracle!" Such mildest tributes admiration Mr. Mole's fanciful reminiscence drew forth. "You must shipped good lot water, honour," said Jack Tiller. "That I did." "More water honour ever took since." Mr. Mole half smelt lurking sarcasm this, honest tar's face showed signs slyness. The evidence dig Mr. Mole's well-known weakness strong waters found merry twinkling listeners' eyes. "I remember something happened Billy Longbow--" began Sam Mason. "Avast, Sam!" interrupted Jack Tiller; "Billy Longbow are not Mr. Mole yarn." CHAPTER XLIV. HUNSTON'S TRIALS IN THE HOLD OF THE "WESTWARD HO!"--THE SHINE WITH HIS PROTECTORS--A STRANGE REVELATION--TROUBLES. Hunston was, meanwhile, getting bad state mind. The mechanical arm resuming invidious advance--its mysterious yet none less terrible attack. "I feel I going hooks," he would mutter himself, grimly, time time. "I shall put old enemy Jack Harkaway trouble burying all. "Well, one good turn deserves another. I buried his brat, he shall bury me. Only he will not get much I his son." He little dreamt young Jack Harry Girdwood upon ship. He seen young Jack once, his fears excited obtained complete mastery his cooler judgment. He took his apparition. * * * * * Joe Basalt Jack Tiller felt unhappy. They long learnt repent slyness concealing stowaway board "Westward Ho!" Honest Joe Basalt rough-and-ready Jack Tiller consulted daily dilemma fallen. "Hark ye, Jack," said his pal Basalt, "we have bin an' made hasses getting chap aboard, dooty clear now." "What is that?" "To go make clean breast skipper." "But cove seemed particular avarse that." "Cos why? Are not he bin telling lies pint measure? He is humbugging us," persisted Basalt. "Let us go talk reasonable him, then," said Tiller, "for must come end. Damme, I do not feel I would an' done hanging job least." They went hold found Hunston. The appearance wretched stowaway time something dreadful. "We come conclusion, mister," said Joe Basalt, "that nothing let skipper know all." Hunston pricked his ears this. "Do what?" he exclaimed, violently. "Split upon me, would ye?" "That is rum word use," said Joe Basalt. "You precious feverish, see skipper let know told us picked water, he would help you--" "To halter," muttered castaway. "Did speak?" "No, Tiller, I: I saying he would not care see me, drop it." "We cannot" "Cannot," repeated Joe Basalt. "Then listen me," exclaimed Hunston, starting new energy; "if tell word anyone breach faith I shall resent it." "Resent! How?" "Easily." "Well, means threatening me. I may well tell I are not afeared man, gets round pulls strength again, I shall happy half hour quiet comfortable, pal, Jack Tiller, shall stand see fair play." And honest Joe rolled his shirt sleeves showing villain Hunston pair powerful brawny arms. "I do not mean that," said Hunston. "But I do." "And I," added Jack Tiller. "I mean say betray Harkaway party, I shall make point letting know kept snug long well paid it, may please master, perhaps, learn little passenger traffic upon account; what is better, sticking money make it." This staggered two sailors little. "You lying, black-hearted swab," ejaculated Tiller, he got his breath. "Would dare?" Hunston curled his lip contemptuously. "Dare!" "Why, sneaking, lying Judas," cried Basalt. "Lying!" echoed Hunston; "is true?" "No." "Not true I paid saving bringing here?" "Yes; but--" "But--but--but pickles. The tale I shall tell speak itself." "Then, damme, shall try now," ejaculated exasperated Joe Basalt, moving towards companion ladder. But he could get further, Hunston sprang him, knife hand. "Hold!" "Stand aside," cried Joe. "When sworn utter word; till then--not till then." The two sailors stared surprise outburst. "Well, Joe," exclaimed his comrade, "did ever see black-hearted villain?" "Not I. But put way you, swab, or, damme, I will make small biscuit you." So saying, he ran Hunston, knocked knife his hand. Hunston endeavoured close him. But temporary strength his fury invested vanished suddenly, he fell ground, dull, heavy load. They ran raise him. To dismay discovered he breathless--lifeless. "He is dead!" "Is he? Then, Lord Harry, must go fetch doctor, shall get awful mess. Stay here, Joe, awhile. I will go see doctor." "Stop bit," said Joe Basalt, feeling stowaway's chest. "He is dead yet. I feel something moving here. Yes, it is beating." "He is fainting, then." "Yes." "Quite enough, top. I will go let know, he go it." Up he ran. Joe Basalt used his best exertions bring swooning man round. * * * * * Tiller found Harkaway deck. "Might I half word honour?" "A dozen, like, Tiller," said old Jack, turning party daring fishermen, relating deeds daring sharks, quite elated narrations giving. Jack Tiller hummed ha'd, looked uneasy, he pulled his forelock spluttered out-- "Please, sir, I have gone like darned bad lot, honour." "Tiller!" "Yes, honour, I have. I have let berth board, stuck money--leastways, that is passenger says, though, Lord help me, I had not least idea thing; I. I took poor drowning wretch in, I put hold keep snug, and--" Here Harkaway interrupted cry wonder astonishment. "What, Tiller, mean say stowaway board 'Westward Ho?'" "Yes, honour," responded frightened mariner. "You done wrong, Jack Tiller," said Harkaway, "very wrong indeed." "I know I have, though Lord help I thought wronging man. The poor devil gratitude, offered money, I took it; I feel I robbing honour, that is all. But I will glad hand money, pal, Joe Basalt." "Joe!" "Yes." "Is he it?" "Yes, sir." "You surprise me." "Devil bit I wonder that, sir. We are thieving, dishonest lot, sir, little I thought it, sir." Old Jack smiled this. "Well, well," he said, moment's reflection, "we will go deeper question seen stowaway." "This way, sir," said worthy Tiller. Old Jack followed below. On reaching hold, he found Joe Basalt kneeling corner wretched stowaway, still deep swoon. "How he?" asked Tiller. "Any better yet?" "No." "Fainted again?" "Yes--hush! do not make row." "Here is governor, Joe," said Jack Tiller. Joe Basalt turned round start, hung his head abashed. "It is right, Joe," said Harkaway, "Do not worry it; wrong conceal me, that is all. And let us look patient. He ill, Jack Tiller tells me." "Yes, honour." "Turn lantern upon his face." The sailor opened his bull's-eye. As glare flashed upon half swooning man, he opened his eyes. The recognition mutual--yes, instantaneous. The stowaway glared fiercely upwards, uttered one word-- "Harkaway!" "Hunston!" CHAPTER XLV. GOOD FOR EVIL--AN UNEXPECTED STROKE OF LUCK FOR HUNSTON. Harkaway, noble generous, Hunston, villain boyhood manhood, together--face face! After changes trials vicissitudes. After acts villainy, treachery, cruelty upon part miserable wretch Hunston. After many acts daring upon part dashing hero, Jack Harkaway. Not word spoken moments. This strange encounter literally deprived power utterance. It unexpected them. Startling--appalling Hunston upon regaining consciousness, find face face man others he dreaded hated most. Need say why? No. The reader not, course, forgotten Hunston ignorant two boys' preservation. Little he dream two destined victims had, little less miracle, escaped his vengeance. Bitter, indeed, therefore, his feelings now, he fully believed young Jack his grave Greek mountains. Under ordinary circumstances he would felt tolerably easy, well he knew ugly customer Jack Harkaway tussle, he also aware Jack would take advantage enemy's powerless condition, matter deep wrongs inflicted. The murder Harkaway's boy, Hunston knew well, crime Harkaway would never look over. His fate sealed. So deeply he convinced he would laid violent hands upon he power. But crowning crime self-murder he powerless commit. "So, Hunston," said Harkaway, sternly, "we meet face face more." Hunston silent. What could he say? "What new villainy brought here?" said Harkaway. "What fresh act devilry contemplation got board vessel?" Hunston gave sickly scornful smile. "Do suppose I knew I was?" "Yes." Hunston stared. "Then I say is, have not improved wit wisdom increasing years. Why, merest chance brought here. I guilty gratitude rule, say." "True." "You have not satisfaction saying it," retorted Hunston, quickly; "I said you. But two men hid idea I was. Being hard pressed shore--where made hot hold me--I took water, I nearly sinking, I hailed boat. They took and--" "And returned compliment." "How?" "By taking in," said Harkaway. "They hid away service. I made tale good them. As time, I feel, nearly world, I do not want wrong." Harkaway listened astonishment. The wretch's allusion his approaching end thrilled Harkaway strangely. "Do feel ill?" he asked. Hunston smiled sardonically this. "Nearly over," his reply. "Laugh away--laugh away!" "Hush, miserable man, hush!" exclaimed Harkaway. "You known nearly life; knew schoolboy man." "Yes." "And one better reason know Jack Harkaway fight helpless enemies, still less he rejoice sufferings worst foe he ever had." Hunston looked up. A faint gleam hope appeared this. But no; impossible. Too well he knew his life forfeited. But he ruminating thus, Harkaway sent one men deck fetch doctor. In course two three minutes man returned, accompanied ship's surgeon. "A stowaway board 'Westward Ho!'" said doctor, he entered hold; "I sooner expected find one board man-of-war." "Examine him, please, doctor," said Harkaway anxiously, "and let us know he is." The doctor made reply, proceeded without fuss demonstration feel sick man's pulse. "Very low," he said; "in bad way. We must get place, enough choke black." He tended carefully he one best friends, instead bitterest, treacherous enemies; and, strange relate, Jack Harkaway appeared little concerned villain's welfare. "Do think danger?" he asked. "Immediate, mean, sir?" said doctor. "Yes." "Humph! I scarcely say. Not exactly immediate, perhaps, care taken." "You think he live?" "Unless fever set take unfavourable turn. He constitutionally strong." "I know that." The doctor looked Harkaway surprise. "You bit doctor, Mr. Harkaway?" Jack smiled. "A small bit," he answered; "only I known man nearly life." "Indeed!" The doctor's manner invited confidence, quite clear his curiosity awakened. Harkaway thought quickly quietly, he came conclusion he could better let doctor participate secret. "You surprised old acquaintance mine board ship, lurking skulking stowaway?" "Well," answered Doctor Anderson, constrained manner, "if I confess honest plain truth, I am." "It simple enough; man know he vessel, would last vessel world he would chosen refuge." "Refuge?" "Yes; refuge word. Now I worst man world half confidences. Tell me, good man keep secret, doctor?" "I am." "Then I may tell something rather startle you." "You will?" "Yes. That poor wretch charge worst enemy I have. It old schoolfellow, Hunston." "Hunston!" "Yes. You remember name, I perceive." "I do. But possible villain audacity venture here?" "No; he would do. He took water, hardly pressed his enemies." "Why, men knew was, would tear piecemeal." "Exactly; that is I wanted speak you, doctor. We must take every care let know." "Really, careful though he cherished friend." "Not quite," answered Harkaway; "only I do not care drop helpless enemy, even viper Hunston." "But he utterly bad lot." "True; I feel slightest compunction taking his life tussle, fair stand-up fight; I cannot do, taking man's life he helpless mercy." The doctor saw Harkaway wish discuss further, he contented obeying orders; Hunston got restored health ship his old schoolfellow, man he injured deeply. Care skill first description lavished upon him. But this, Hunston would probably languished died wretchedly upon coast Greece, unless accident thrown power authorities. In case, his destiny would speedily accomplished. His end--the scaffold. CHAPTER XLVI. HUNSTON'S PROGRESS--MISGIVINGS--THE WARNINGS FROM THE GRAVE. "Mr. Harkaway." "Doctor." "A word you, convenient, sir." "Certainly, doctor," returned old Jack. And walked deck together. "It concerning patient." "What him?" "There something concerning mechanical arm completely baffles me. It poisoned, I fear." "You astonish me," said Harkaway. While talking over, young Jack dropped cabin. Now, boy knew better anybody history mechanical arm. It forgotten reader death Robert Emmerson occurred board pirate vessel captivity young Jack Harkaway Harry Girdwood. Although many adventures gone since then, forgotten captivity Hunston Toro striven might main compass poor boy's destruction. It needless recall reader's recollection time wondrous work perfected Robert Emmerson, time his work indirect his death. The legend steel arm forgotten boys. * * * * * "This arm made notorious Protean Bob," said young Jack his father. "You remember Protean Bob?" "Yes." "He highly-skilled mechanician, appears, he gave thoroughly manufacture arm." "It certainly marvellous piece work," said Doctor Anderson. "The strangest part story is," said young Jack, "that inventor knows exact working it, concealed springs something deadly avenge inventor wearer arm ever prove wanting gratitude. And Hunston, know--" "Never troubled anyone gratitude." "No, indeed," said Doctor Anderson, reflectively; "the strangest part is, he never misses opportunity railing you." "Against me!" said Harkaway. "Ungrateful ruffian!" exclaimed Harvey, entered spoken. "He thinks he gets well, take his life, he still ignorant boys here, lives saved," said doctor. "I see, I see," said young Jack; "he does not know escaped death he fancied sure. He ought suffer that." "Hush!" said old Jack: "he punished enough already." "Not quite. I do not think he could punished enough," said Harry Girdwood. "Nor I." "Stop, stop," said Harkaway, seriously; "I suffered you, hands man, I forgive him, surely can." * * * * * Now, Hunston gained strength, his old evil passions returned full force. The nurses appointed attend his bedside, two sailors rescued watery grave, honest Joe Basalt his friend Jack Tiller. These two bluff tars appointed post reasons reader readily comprehend. They received long lesson old Jack doctor too. They forbidden mention certain matters, although Hunston would wheedle cross-examine skill Old Bailey lawyer, he quite failed get information them. "At rate," exclaimed patient, utter despair, "you do not mind telling whither bound." "Oh, yes, I do," returned Joe Basalt, duty time being. "Why?" "Cannot tell." "You do not think Harkaway means to--" "Mister Harkaway, please," interrupted Joe Basalt, surlily. "Well then, Mr. Harkaway," said Hunston, impatiently. "That is better." "You do not think he means hand authorities nearest port, you?" Joe mum. "Eh?" Not word. Hunston still remained ignorance presence boys--aye, even existence. * * * * * "Massa Jack," said Sunday youthful hero, one morning, "we often gib poor old Daddy Mole teasing, sir, frightening." Young Jack grinned. "We have." "Ought he get easier dan dat dam skunk, dat Hunston fellar?" "Yes, would not recommend joking Mr. Mole?" "No. I would let joke, Massa Jack; I would frighten his darned skin, dat's all." Harry Girdwood taken confidence, fine plot agreed upon. The difficulty sailor nurse. Joe Basalt guard again. They gave Joe Basalt good stiff tumbler grog--and sailor could resist that?--and oh, wickedness! grog hocussed. In plainer language, means drugged. Not long drinking healths bumper, old Joe felt drowsy, he fell asleep. The patient slept, would awakened probably two hours two negroes Sunday Monday set unearthly, moaning noise. The pitch low thrilling, pleasantest thing man hear conscience laden guilt wretched man Hunston's. The sick man time oblivious sounds going his special ear. But certain delay began tell. He moaned. Then moved. Then turned upon his back. "Hunston! Hunston! oh, Hunston!" Sunday groaned. "Awake." And two darkeys would groan together. A responsive moan Hunston heard. He opened his eyes, moaned groaned, awoke wakeful once. And he awoke! His startled eyes fell upon two awful awesome figures. The two boys, young Jack Harry Girdwood, standing hand hand, faces bearing ghastly pallor grave brows smeared blood. In darkened cabin flickering, phosphorescent light played upon them, hint perhaps borrowed practical joking chamber sham necromancer Greece. The two victims glared upon sick man, he could stare fearful silence. He stared. Then he closed his eyes rubbed them, opened again, assure real. But never moved. Never spoke. He essayed speak. But his tongue refused wag. It stuck roof his mouth. The perspiration stood upon his brow thick beads. Presently, sound came him, dull, hollow moan anguish, sounded like echo "yawning grave." A sound seemed contain pent-up agony whole lifetime suffering. But his tormentors merciless. They budge. "Away, horrible creatures!" gasped miserable wretch, tones scarcely louder whisper. "Away, hide yourselves!" And he strove drag coverlet his head. But fearful fascination forced spite look again. "I know unreal," he faltered. "I know mind wandering--that I fancy all--all. Begone! away!" As well might he invited shake hand embrace affectionately. No. There stuck glaring upon eyes full hideous menace. "What brings here?" he said again. "Why come torment now? Rest graves. Away, I say, away!" His manner grew violent he went speaking. "You mercy upon us," said young Jack; "and remember last upon earth." A groan Hunston response. "Beware!" said Harry Girdwood, sepulchral tones. "Beware, I say!" "Beware!" chimed others, one voice. "I warned time would come would beg mercy father," pursued young Jack. "I told grovel abject terror, plead vain--aye, vain." "Never!" retorted Hunston. "To-morrow show you." "What?" cried Hunston, feverish eagerness, he dreaded hear. "Your fate." "It false." "The rope ready--the noose run. You shall die dog's death." "And shall die hard," added Harry Girdwood. A groan, fearful preceded, burst guilty wretch. "But Harkaway merciful." "As were." "No, no, no; he full forgiveness, I know." "But crimes like yours." "He could pardon you, even he would." "Why not?" demanded Hunston, quickly. "Because crew would drag piecemeal. No, no, no, Hunston; fate sealed. The rope ready--the noose waiting you. In torment suffering shall die death rabid cur, death loathsome reptile, poisonous thing true humanity rid earth." He could hear more. With moan incalculable terror he dived bedclothes shut fearful vision. When he ventured forth again, gone. Vanished! They returned noiselessly come. * * * * * "Basalt." "Hullo!" The drugged sailor fought opiate administered opened his eyes. "There is one here, there, Basalt? Tell me." "What muttering now?" demanded Joe Basalt, his surliest tones. "Are alone?" "Of course." "I awful dream, good friend," said Hunston, still shiver. "Then keep yourself," retorted Joe. "I do not care value ship's biscuit dream--yours anybody else's--so stow gaff. Close peepers, let get winks, I can, always providing I am troubling honourable self." Not even honest old Joe's withering irony could affect patient, profoundly pleased he find supernatural visitors gone--melted, were, thin air. Hunston turned his side, muttering-- "If I giant strength Toro, I would soon take revenge upon ship contains--yes, deep deadly revenge." After moment, he muttered-- "I wonder brigand Toro alive dead, I shall ever his help destroy old hated enemy Harkaway." CHAPTER XLVII WHEREIN HUNSTON'S EVIL PROPENSITIES CATCH HIM IN A TRAP--DANGER--ANOTHER SHARK--MR. MOLE SUFFERS. "I horrible dreams, doctor," said Hunston next morning. "I do not much wonder dreams ugly ones," replied doctor, significantly. Hunston coughed. There mistaking doctor's meaning. The conversation hung fire moment. "I quite understand may dream many things would scarcely bear repetition." "That is case," angrily retorted patient. "Indeed." The end doctor treated patient feverish symptoms tricks night created, day wore on, he got calmer better. Time wore on. Days grew weeks. The mysterious ravages secret poisoning still baffled Doctor Anderson prevented complete restoration patient. "There is something extraordinary this," doctor would say Hunston, "something quite beyond me. If nineteenth century, I almost inclined believe spell cast upon you." Hunston winced. "Upon me?" "Yes; rather upon wonderful mechanical arm. I almost think wearer ban." The doctor's words thrilled listener strangely. Little he know Doctor Anderson well acquainted history mechanical arm, ill-fated inventor, Robert Emmerson. Little he think doctor's words meant produce exact effect had. The doctor's speech sank deeply Hunston's mind, he brooded day night. But although affect his health, certainly unwholesome effect upon his mind, result soon made manifest. * * * * * That afternoon two boys tutor deck. There scarcely breath wind ocean, sails hanging loosely spars vessel rose fell upon swelling waves. "What country sharks!" exclaimed Mr. Mole, seated low bulwarks weather quarter, enjoying little air was, carefully unloading his pocket pistol. "Beg pardon, Mr. Mole," said Harry, "but name _this particular country?"_ Mole frowned horribly. "You impudent boy." "No, sir, youth inquiring turn mind. What chief city country?" "I never answer absurd questions." Mr. Mole took another suck pistol (_i.e._ flask), his countenance relaxed. "It place sharks, though," he said; "only look great fellow here." Harry looked, young Jack. There monster deep moving slowly fro, occasionally coming nearly surface sinking apparently without effort almost sight. The fish greater size already killed. He came looked old Mole turned away, evidently thinking worthy tutor much old, lean tough his dainty stomach; he caught sight Jack Harry, he showed animation. Evidently his taste. "I mean try him," said Jack. "Do so, boy. I shall make sportsman yet, I see," observed Mole. "You certainly put us wrinkle two lately, sir." "Bah! father considered clever man pertains sporting, he comparison me?" Young Jack hear conclusion speech, he gone away get his fishing tackle, large hook attached chain. He quickly returned, baited hook ten pounds beef, gone little queer bottom tub. "Now, Mr. Sharkey, let us see digest that," exclaimed Jack, he dropped hook overboard. The shark looked closely, looked Jack, though he would much prefer fisher bait. "It use, Jack," said Harry; "he hungry." "Strikes unskilfulness angling, rather want appetite shark's part," remarked Mr. Mole. "Would like try, sir?" "Hem! well, I do not mind showing it," responded professor. Jack began haul line, coiling Mole's feet, rather his feet been. But sharkey, finding danger losing his dinner, made dart meat left water, discovering barb hook stuck his mouth, she darted great rate, sad relate, rope flew bulwark, got twisted round one Mr. Mole's stumps, worthy professor flew ocean For wooden-legged man swim well, even keep afloat treading water, somewhat difficult task Mr. Mole would found it, Harry Girdwood promptly followed advice given celebrated American-- "When see drowning man, throw rail him." Harry threw plank, Mr. Mole fortunate enough clutch it, thereby enabled keep afloat. But he exposed another danger. The shark irritated rusty iron his throat, rushing hither thither furious manner, snapping his jaws way made spectators thankful deck. And then, turning back, bit Mole. "Help, help!" shouted Mole. "Oh! brute taken leg off." The shark resumed natural position, held Mole's stump water, puzzled know it. "This fault," said young Jack, seizing cutlass, he leaped overboard. "Lower away boat," shouted Dick Harvey, come deck. He Jefferson also armed themselves, leap young Jack's assistance, Harkaway senior appeared. "Hold, let man risk his life," he said. "But--" "But excitement good, I want good fight keep spirits up." While speaking he thrown his coat shoes, cutlass hand, leaped rescue his son old Mole. By time, however, boat lowered pulling rapidly towards Mr. Mole, still clung his plank thirty yards stern vessel. Old Jack powerful strokes reached him. "Hold on, Mr. Mole; boat coming. You youngster, swim way once." "I am going fight fish, dad." "You not. Away once." During brief conversation shark sight. He rose surface, perceiving three enemies, seemed undecided attack first. And fish hesitating, Harkaway resolved open campaign. Accordingly he dived, intention coming beneath fish administering stab. Old Jack Tiller Joe Basalt moment engaged hauling Mr. Mole boat; half way gunwale, shark made snap away went professor's leg. "Mercy, help! The beast devouring inches," screamed Mole, he rolled headlong boat. Joe Basalt seeing young Jack still itching go shark, seized collar dragged in. They rested oars prepared give elder Harkaway assistance could. "I lay five three monster deep," said Harvey. "I accept wager terms," said Mole, discovered he unhurt, reviving. He took another swig pistol sat watch conflict. The shark, finding he one opponent deal with, turned towards Harkaway, dived again, getting time fairly beneath fish, thrust his cutlass hilt stomach. Startled sudden attack, smarting pain caused wound, shark leaped half water, fell loud splash close Jack. Everyone board time deck, watching unequal struggle. While shark twisting turning get adversary, Jack managed give second stab; rather hot work, though, Jack obliged dive frequently he little time recover his breath. He endeavouring so, shark made another rush him. Old Jack dived again, young Jack would his father's assistance Joe Basalt forcibly restrained him. A third stab made shark feel queer indeed. In fact, Harkaway thought fish done for, struck ship, he grasped rope permitted drawn up, shark recovered made another vicious dart him. Our hero, had, his time, vanquished many foes, felt hardly inclined let shark get best him. He dropped rope sank beneath waves head brute emerged therefrom. Then like shot; keen cutlass tore way vitals fish. Then fin lopped off, seconds afterwards huge carcase seen floating waves. Harkaway seized rope fastened round head tail his vanquished foe, hauled deck. "Bravo, old man," exclaimed Harvey, shaking his schoolfellow hand. "You well." "Though certainly long time it," observed Mole. "I could have--" "You could paid three sovs. time," replied Harvey, "so dust." Mole made reply. Jefferson added his congratulations. "Pshaw!" said Jack. "Mr. Mole all." "How?" "Why, he poisoned poor shark his wooden legs. It is enough make fish disgusted life." A loud laugh followed. "Meanwhile," said Mole, "will some-one good enough give lift?" The professor hoisted deck, changed clothes, great shark-killer shipped two new wooden pins, he grew quite bounceable ever. Especially death last shark still jocularly attributed him. CHAPTER XLVIII OLD JOE PLOTS WITH HUNSTON--WHAT CAME OF THE PLOT. The Harkaway family guests assembled dinner, shark-fishing, conversation turned upon old enemy. "I wish fairly rid him," said Mrs. Harkaway, "for he board, I feel misfortune hanging us." Jack smiled. "Have dreams, Emily?" he asked, slily, "Do not learn mock, sir," retorted lady, mock asperity, "You influenced dreams now." Jack looked serious. "That is true." "And owe wretched man nothing--" "But hate." "We that," said Jefferson; "but he miserable wretch, afford let cheaply, without paying old scores." "What wish do, then?" demanded Harkaway. "I willing abide decision may come to." "Well," said Mr. Mole, "I propose he shall put ashore." "When?" There rub. They many weary miles away sight land. "Put ashore first time come within reach land," suggested Harvey. "We will," said Harkaway, "if general wish." "It is." It put vote found everybody, without single exception, desirous seeing back Hunston. Who wonder? None. "Well, well," said old Jack, "that agreed upon. And now, Emily, dear, I hope mind rest." "Almost." "What! does not satisfy yet?" "For present; I shall satisfied he really place altogether, he regular nightmare me." "You fanciful, dear," said old Jack. "Perhaps; times made light presentiments," said Emily. As words spoken, saloon door opened enter Joe Basalt. Now old Joe wore face long fiddle, addressing Harkaway he requested words private. "Presently, Joe," said Harkaway. The old tar twisted his hat round waited. "What, will not presently you?" "I would sooner once," said Joe. "Well, it," said Harkaway. "Before everyone, honour?" Joe demanded. "Yes." He looked shyly him, cast furtive glance ladies he ventured speak out. "I want break honour gently possible, I want know honour thinks me?" Old Jack stared. "Why, really, Joe--" "I think Joe wants know think he is handsome," suggested Dick Harvey. "Do admire cut his figurehead?" chimed young Jack. But Joe Basalt evidently much upset preoccupied something his mind heed chaff. "No, honour," he said, fiercely, "what I want know is--do consider d--d mutineering swab?" "Joe, Joe," exclaimed Harkaway, laughing spite himself, "moderate language; remember ladies present." Joe reddened roots his hair. "I ax pardon, every mother's son them," he said, tugging his forelock; "but feelin's carries away." "Tell us is, then," said Jefferson, "and perhaps offer advice." "Well, then, sir, I have insulted." "I see, I see," said Jefferson; "you row one messmates." "And punched his head?" suggested young Jack. "Serve right, too, Joe," said Harry Girdwood. "No, no, young gentlemen," said Joe, "I are not done that, else I quite happy--that is it--because I wanted his honour's permission." "What?" "To give good licking," urged Joe Basalt; "you see, I could not well without, it is stowaway." The interest whole company redoubled this. "He is his tricks again," said Joe. "I thought so." "And d--d dirty tricks are, too. The swab cannot nothing fair square board. He allers cruises nasty, sly, piratical way." "What it? Tell us once." "Yes, sir, I will. Why, see, fact is, he a-sounding trying crew satisfied honour." A low murmur went mouth mouth around table. "He is never trying undermine you, old fidelity!" ejaculated Harkaway. Joe nodded. "That is it, honour." "Villain!" "And what is more, he is trying Jack Tiller." "He has?" Harkaway's brow darkened, expression his face grew ominous. "How Jack Tiller meet his advances?" asked Harvey. "Why, Jack are not got command himself, he--" Joe paused. "So what?" "Why, Jack gave one himself; he are not damaged much," Joe hastened add apologetically, "for Jack Tiller knows his dooty better that, honour. No, he is put one his toplights mourning." This sent two boys ecstasies. "And see, honour, he opened fire me, I could hardly believe possible, he put plainer, I staggered I know do, I thought I would come let know." Harkaway, looking up, caught his wife's glance fixed upon him. "You see, does not scoff secret apprehensions," she said, quietly. "No, no. This shall seen once," he answered, rising his seat. "Come me, Dick, you, Jefferson." They left cabin, followed old Joe Basalt. Now, got deck, Jack Harkaway led way part alone, likely disturbed. "Now, Joe," said he, "I thinking matter over. I know spoken truth, without word exaggeration. But must catch villain his snare." "How, honour?" "I will tell you. You must go back traitor, must play part willing listener." "A what?" "A willing listener. You must let think ready join his villainy, see?" "I do, honour, damme I like it." "You like instance, Joe, good us all. This man worst villain alive. I forgiven wrongs would think possible forgive; safety concerned, must done." Joe scratched his head, looked troubled. "If that is orders, honour, I have nothing obey." "Right, Joe." * * * * * Having primed Joe Basalt his lesson, marched Hunston's cabin, Joe entered, Harkaway, Dick Harvey, Jefferson took position near could overhear going within. "Well, shipmate," said Basalt, "how goes it?" Hunston lying his side, holding damp towel his damaged eye. He turned round, grunted ungracious words. "I have brought news," said Joe, repeating his lesson; "there regular shine deck." Hunston turned quickly round this. "What is wrong?" he asked, anxiously. "You have not saying thing, I am sure mistaken, as--" "As Jack Tiller was." "Yes." And Hunston fondled blackened eye, mentally cursing Tiller his hard, horny fist. "Not I," said Joe Basalt, "not I. There is row aloft, I told you. Three men put irons, I got trouble well." "What for?" "Nothing," answered Joe Basalt, surly imitation anger. "That is it, nothing, are not stirrups neither?" "They are!" exclaimed Hunston. "Rather." "And say?" "Say!" exclaimed Basalt. "Why, they would lief draw cutlass his weasand, they would smash ship's biscuit." Hunston's pale face grew crimson words. "That is good," he said; "they are men spirit." "That are." "And rest crew; say it?" "Why, it; man. So good thing offer, I will undertake say they will volunteer man." "Good." "And leave Harkaway folks lurch here, deserve, mean beasts." "Mean, indeed," echoed Hunston, secretly chuckling. "Why, they are worse mean." "So you would say knew palaver they have made here, pretending it is charity like, when, course, know--" "That it is goodness, hot-headed comrade." "Do not speak Jack Tiller, friend," said Joe, working his part capitally time; "he sees fool he made himself." "Did he say so?" "Yes." "Why he go so?" "He quite misunderstood meaning." "The deuce he did. Why, however could be? I pretty explicit." "He thought sell him. In fact, he made sure overheard us grumbling together skipper, a-trying tell Mr. Harkaway it." "Did he say so?" "Yes." "Then undeceive immediately." "I done so." "As this," added Hunston, pointing his discoloured eye cheek, "I think nothing it. All I will ask he shall much Harkaway." "That he will," said Joe, sham heartiness. "And soon shall ship ours?" Hunston glanced anxiously towards door. "There is fear," said Joe, answering his look; "they busy for'ard, talking poor devils irons." "Brutes!" "Aye, are. But shall get free floating prison, cos that is seems a-coming to?" "I will tell you," answered Hunston, sinking his voice, "we will serve Harkaway party he served messmates." "How?" "Put irons." Joe Basalt gave start this. "And would go?" "Chuck overboard, all, everyone them, except women." "I hardly like that," said Joe. "Then shall _my task_," exclaimed Hunston, warming he unfolded his diabolical scheme. "I like part myself. I swore finish off," he added, Joe, "and I shall keep oath all, I begin think. I will throw overboard--Harkaway, Jefferson, Harvey, all." He looked suddenly door. Three big forms stood upon threshold cabin. The three whose names Hunston uttered. Harkaway, Jefferson, Dick Harvey. "I thought I heard call us," said latter. Hunston's colour fled his cheek. He looked one other. Then he glanced Joe Basalt. Harkaway first break silence. "Hunston." The sound echoed dismally, though uttered bare-walled cavern. "Yes," he faltered, struggling appear his ease. "Come." "Where to?" Harkaway pointed silently door. "What want me?" "Cannot guess?" The words simple ones, yet sounded like death-knell him. "We heard all; every word. This crowning act villany ingratitude, baser ever entered mind man, doomed you. Follow me." Appalled, half stunned fear, miserable wretch tottered Harkaway. Close upon his heels came Jefferson Dick, Joe Basalt brought rear. CHAPTER XLIX. THE TRIAL--HUNSTON'S PUNISHMENT. "Pipe hands deck!" "Aye, aye, sir." The crew came tumbling up. And assembled, Jefferson Dick Harvey ranged round position, Harkaway, Hunston close his side, stood forward address them. "My men," said he, "I called together upon pleasant errand. But question duty, and, therefore, pleasant unpleasant, must done. What act justice, I do not wish anyone able impugn motives. I would leave power man say I ever behaved unjustly worst enemy." "Hurrah!" A ringing cheer greeted Harkaway. "Now, men, I say concerns family history, perhaps, you. You heard poor boy's adventures he fell hands Greek brigands?" "Aye, aye, sir." "You know instrumental getting condemned death." "It sneaking lubber, Hunston," cried several voices once. "It was. I need enlarge upon he done merit worst punishment power bestow, ever he fall hands--the worst I say, eh?" "Yes,--him!" said voice, strong expletive. The approval crew perfectly unanimous. In vain Hunston look one disaffected men Joe Basalt spoken. Not vestige thing like opposition general sentiments he trace weather-beaten, honest countenances. "Well," resumed Harkaway, "and would say if, I forgiven him, taken hand carefully tended nursed, would say even he tried wrong me--to ensnare innocent, well-meaning men, murderous plot life?" "Why, I say he is blackest-hearted lubber ashore afloat," said one. "One word more," said Harkaway. "What wretch power?" "Give round dozen, begin with," suggested Sam Mason. "And string up." A cheer came score throats. "Men," said Harkaway, "this villain, Hunston." A pause. The men thoroughly taken surprise word say themselves. "I anxious spare him," said Harkaway, conclusion, "for although he always false, treacherous, cruel, I could forget he fellow-countryman, boys together. I would returned good evil, he refused it; I mean try evil evil." The men applauded echo. Joe Basalt his comrade Jack Tiller passed word forward mouth mouth. They told shipmates taken place, thoroughly incensed his life would worth five minutes' purchase Harkaway, Jefferson, Dick Harvey absented themselves. "Come," said Jefferson, "it growing late; let us settle off-hand." "What verdict?" said Harvey, "Let men decide." Their decision take long arriving at. As single voice, men responded-- "Death!" A sickening sensation stole Hunston. There enough appal stoutest heart, true, he felt over. "Very good," said Harkaway, "His fate you." "String yardarm once, then," suggested Sam Mason. "Tie heels let us shoot him." "Let walk plank." "No; hanging better fun. It is dog's death he earned, let his deserts." A rope got end flung yardarm, running noose made it. Then rough hands laid upon doomed man. This aroused lifting his voice his behalf. "Harkaway," he said, "do know murder--cold-blooded murder?" "So every execution, even sanctioned law." "But done upon ample proof." "We proof enough." "You have not single witness me," said Hunston, eagerly. "Plenty." "Where is one? Let go, I tell you," he cried frantically, men dragging towards rope. "This murder; you will hang it, Harkaway; you will--cowards! upon one." But pay much heed his ravings. "Do hear, Harkaway?" he cried, "This murder, whatever call it. It hang yet; least, transport life." Harkaway smiled. "I shall soil fingers matter." "It work!" yelled Hunston, struggling mad desperation. "Then we will hand it," said Harkaway; "we will pull together, one fix upon his fellow--" "You will escape," yelled miserable wretch. "You will swing yourself; will, I swear. You witnesses; two sailors notorious liars." "Take that, swab," cried Joe Basalt, dashing his fist his face. "They greater curs yourself," yelled Hunston; "such witnesses would swear away life glass grog--witnesses indeed--" He stopped short. His glance fell upon two forms standing close by--young Jack Harry Girdwood. Both dressed he last seen mountain haunt brigands. Hunston still ignorance rescue boys. For he knew, bodies rotting mountain grave Greece. They bent upon sad stern look efficacious before, he cowered them. Appalled horrible phantoms come mock his last moments, he clapped his hand his eyes vain endeavour shut sight. Vain, indeed, sight possessed horrible fascination him, pen describe. "Down, beg mercy," said young Jack, solemnly. "On knees, wretch!" added Harry Girdwood. "Hah!" The two boys pointed together feet Harkaway senior. The condemned man caught meaning once. A wild cry hope came his lips, he burst sailors held threw Harkaway's feet. "Mercy, mercy, Harkaway!" he cried, piteously. "Have mercy, love Heaven, hope mercy hereafter." Harkaway gazed silence. "Look there," cried Hunston, wildly, pointing two boys stood still contemplation scene, "Look there; see, begging mercy me." "Who? Where?" demanded Harkaway, considerable astonishment "Your son, boy; do not see him?" pursued Hunston, wildly. "Look. No--It fancy, fear-stricken mind, conjures horrible visions. Ugh!" And he cowered Harkaway's feet averted glance, endeavouring shut fearsome sight. "Take away," said Harkaway men. They advanced laid hands upon him, Hunston fought madly clung Harkaway's knees desperation. It his last chance, he felt positive. "Think, Harkaway, think," he cried again. "Remember boyhood's days; remember youth, passed school together. We college chums, and--" "No; quite," interrupted Dick Harvey disgust. "We Oxford together, never chums." "You never sort man one would care chum with," added Harkaway. "Never!" "Take away." Hunston gave loud yell despair, gazed around him. Again his glance riveted sight two boys standing attitude, horror-stricken, appalled, he sank upon ground heap half fainting. A miserable, piteous object indeed. * * * * * "Hunston," said Harkaway, minutes' pause, "you bade think. It turn bid think. If white-livered fears blinded judgment, would known life safe here." Hunston raised his head slowly. He gazed vacant look, utterly Unable realise meaning Harkaway's words. "You jest," he faltered. "We butchers," said Jefferson, sternly. Humbled, degraded, though he was, words hope sent blood coursing his veins wildly. Saved! Was possible? Young Jack stepped circle approached miserable wretch. "When last stood face face, ordered Greek brigands fire us, Hunston, I told would come about." Hunston shrank affrightedly lad. "I told you, Hunston," continued young Jack, "that time would come would grovel dirt beg life father. That time come, see. Like miserable cur are, grovel beg pray way I would never condescend you. You tasted horrors anticipation, worse death itself. Now, perhaps, know I comrade Harry felt condemned us death." "We told you," added Harry Girdwood quietly, "that would come home you; has." During foregoing, Hunston began realise truth. They lived. "Get up," said Jefferson; "it time end sickening scene." Hunston slowly rose his feet "Excuse me," said captain, stepping forward, "but captain ship--under orders, Mr. Harkaway, course--I cannot see possible allow his offence go unpunished. You course liberty forgive wrong he may done all, due deference I must set face winking offences he committed board ship." "Listen skipper," added another crew. "To let scot free would encourage insubordination mutiny, fact." "Then I leave you, captain," said Harkaway; "I shall interfere management ship." Hunston's heart sank. "Get rid once," suggested Harvey. "How?" "Lower boat; provision month set adrift." "Good." "Do that," said Hunston, "and consign living death, worse tortures savages could inflict." He remembered well he Toro Italian cast adrift "Flowery Land." He forgotten horrors cruise. It was, truth, he said, ten times horrible death hands could be. "My opinion is," said captain, "that his crime punished once; crime allowed pass board ship." "What would do?" "Tie grating give four dozen lashes." A wild storm cheering greeted proposal. There feeble attempt opposition upon part Harkaway party, overruled captain crew. "I am cruel man, gentlemen," said captain, "but I must side crew this. Now, we will give every chance. I propose let single voice raised his favour." Not word spoken. "If think, men, he punished, he shall escape. Let man stand forth shall settle it. I allow escape question motives whosoever speaks him." Hunston looked anxiously around him. Not voice. Not much glance pity he encounter there. His hope man he wronged present, despair he turned Harkaway. But latter moved away spot silence. Despair. Rough, horny hands laid upon him, his coat shirt torn shreds his back he stood stripped waist. The grating rigged punishment, culprit lashed securely it. "Barclay." "Yes, sir." "Stand forward." "Here, sir." "Take cat." "Yes, sir." This youngest boy ship. The lad took whip poised his hand eager begin operations. "Joe Basalt." "Yes, honour." "Time strokes." "Aye, aye, sir." The boy Barclay received his instructions, noted diligently. "Strike well up, low. You understand, well across shoulders." "Yes, cap'n," "And do not eager quick. Let stroke tell tale." What miserable man's feelings he heard his torture prepared thus, coolness deliberation, leave imagine. A momentary pause occurred, every one present looked mixed sensations eagerness dread. "One!" A whizzing noise. Then dull, heavy thud, thongs came contact culprit's back shoulders. A gasp came spectators, convulsive shudder suffering wretch himself. And his shoulders showed series livid ridges bruised flesh. "Two." Down came lash. The blood shot forth right shoulder, flesh encounter cruel whip. "Three." A moan utter anguish burst victim, whose blood streamed his back. A sickening, horrible sight contemplate. "Four." "Hah!" "Come away," exclaimed Harkaway; "come away this. It makes sick faint." "Yes," said Jefferson; "it taste." "Nor mine." "Nor mine," said Dick. "This may Justice, friend," said Jack Harkaway "but is not English--it humanity." "Five." A cry came prisoner. "Cast loose!" cried Harkaway, "No more--no more!" But sailors appear hear. "Six." "Have done, I say!" thundered Jefferson. "Enough this!" "Excuse me, sir," said captain, "we duty perform. I understand pleasant you, but--" "Seven," sang Joe Basalt, drowning every voice. Down came whip again. And thongs struck lacerated flesh wretched man he gave piercing shriek. It sounded like cry wild animal utterance human being. "Eight." "Fetch doctor," exclaimed Harkaway. Young Jack, secretly glad excuse begone, ran brought doctor below. "Doctor Anderson," said Harkaway hurriedly, "I believe sincerely man earned he great deal more." "Indeed he has," said Doctor Anderson. "But I cannot endure lash.
