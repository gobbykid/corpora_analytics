 AT THE BACK OF THE NORTH WIND CHAPTER I. THE HAY-LOFT I HAVE asked tell back north wind. An old Greek writer mentions people lived there, comfortable could bear longer, drowned themselves. My story his. I think Herodotus got right account place. I going tell fared boy went there. He lived low room coach-house; means back north wind, his mother well knew. For one side room built boards, boards old might run penknife north wind. And let settle sharper! I know pulled wind would like cat mouse, would know soon enough back north wind. Still, room cold, except north wind blew stronger usual: room I always cold, except summer, sun took matter his hands. Indeed, I sure whether I ought call room all; loft kept hay straw oats horses. And little Diamond--but stop: I must tell his father, coachman, named favourite horse, his mother objection:--when little Diamond, then, lay bed, he could hear horses munching away dark, moving sleepily dreams. For Diamond's father built bed loft boards round it, little room end coach-house; Diamond's father put old Diamond stall bed, he quiet horse, go sleep standing, lay like reasonable creature. But, although he surprisingly reasonable creature, yet, young Diamond woke middle night, felt bed shaking blasts north wind, he could help wondering whether, wind blow house down, he fall manger, old Diamond might not eat he knew his night-gown. And although old Diamond quiet night long, yet he woke he got like earthquake, young Diamond knew of the clock was, least done next, was--to go sleep fast he could. There hay his feet hay his head, piled great trusses roof. Indeed sometimes little lane several turnings, looked sawn him, he could reach his bed all. For stock hay was, course, always state either slow ebb sudden flow. Sometimes whole space loft, little panes roof stars look in, would lie open his open eyes he lay bed; sometimes yellow wall sweet-smelling fibres closed his view distance half yard. Sometimes, his mother undressed her room, told trot bed himself, he would creep heart hay, lie thinking cold outside wind, warm inside his bed, he could go he pleased, he would not yet; he would get little colder first. And ever he grew colder, his bed would grow warmer, till last he would scramble hay, shoot like arrow his bed, cover up, snuggle down, thinking happy boy he was. He least idea wind got chink wall, blew night. For back his bed boards inch thick, side north wind. Now, I already said, boards soft crumbly. To sure, tarred outside, yet many places like tinder timber. Hence happened soft part worn away it, little Diamond found one night, he lay down, knot come one them, wind blowing upon cold rather imperious fashion. Now he fancy leaving things wrong might set right; he jumped bed again, got little strike hay, twisted up, folded middle, and, thus made cork, stuck hole wall. But wind began blow loud angrily, and, Diamond falling asleep, blew his cork hit nose, hard enough wake quite, let hear wind whistling shrill hole. He searched his hay-cork, found it, stuck harder, dropping more, when, pop! angry whistle behind it, cork struck again, time cheek. Up he rose more, made fresh stopple hay, corked hole severely. But he hardly before--pop! came his forehead. He gave up, drew clothes his head, soon fast asleep. Although next day stormy, Diamond forgot hole, he busy making cave side his mother's fire broken chair, three-legged stool, blanket, sitting it. His mother, however, discovered it, pasted bit brown paper it, that, Diamond snuggled next night, he occasion think it. Presently, however, he lifted his head listened. Who could talking him? The wind rising again, getting loud, full rushes whistles. He sure one talking--and near him, too, was. But he frightened, he yet learned be; he sat hearkened. At last voice, which, though quite gentle, sounded little angry, appeared come back bed. He crept nearer it, laid his ear wall. Then he heard nothing wind, sounded loud indeed. The moment, however, he moved his head wall, he heard voice again, close his ear. He felt his hand, came upon piece paper his mother pasted hole. Against he laid his ear, he heard voice quite distinctly. There was, fact, little corner paper loose, that, mouth wall, voice came. “What mean, little boy--closing window?” “What window?” asked Diamond. “You stuffed hay three times last night. I blow three times.” “You cannot mean little hole! It is not window; it is hole bed.” “I say window: I said window.” “But cannot window, windows holes see of.” “Well, that is I made window for.” “But outside: cannot want window.” “You quite mistaken. Windows see of, say. Well, I am house, I want windows see it.” “But you have made window bed.” “Well, mother got three windows dancing room, three garret.” “But I heard father say, mother wanted make window wall, law, would look Mr. Dyves's garden.” The voice laughed. “The law would trouble catch me!” said. “But it is right, know,” said Diamond, “that is matter. You should not it.” “I tall I law,” said voice. “You must tall house, then,” said Diamond. “Yes; tall house: clouds inside it.” “Dear me!” said Diamond, thought minute. “I think, then, hardly expect keep window bed you. Why do not make window Mr. Dyves's bed?” “Nobody makes window ash-pit,” said voice, rather sadly. “I like see nice things windows.” “But he must nicer bed I have, though mine nice--so nice I could not wish better.” “It is bed I care about: it is it.--But open window.” “Well, mother says I should not disobliging; it is rather hard. You see north wind blow right face I do.” “I North Wind.” “O-o-oh!” said Diamond, thoughtfully. “Then promise blow face I open window?” “I cannot promise that.” “But you will give toothache. Mother's got already.” “But what is become without window?” “I am sure I do not know. All I say is, worse you.” “No; not. You shall worse it--I promise that. You much better it. Just believe I say, I tell you.” “Well, I pull clothes head,” said Diamond, feeling his little sharp nails, he got hold open edge paper tore once. In came long whistling spear cold, struck his little naked chest. He scrambled tumbled bedclothes, covered up: paper voice, he felt little--not frightened exactly--I told he learned yet--but rather queer; strange person North Wind must lived great house--“called Out-of-Doors, I suppose,” thought Diamond--and made windows people's beds! But voice began again; he could hear quite plainly, even his head bed-clothes. It still gentle voice now, although six times large loud been, he thought sounded little like his mother's. “What name, little boy?” asked. “Diamond,” answered Diamond, bed-clothes. “What funny name!” “It is nice name,” returned owner. “I do not know that,” said voice. “Well, I do,” retorted Diamond, little rudely. “Do know speaking!” “No,” said Diamond. And indeed he not. For know person's name always know person's self. “Then I must angry you.--You better look see, though.” “Diamond pretty name,” persisted boy, vexed give satisfaction. “Diamond useless thing rather,” said voice. “That is true. Diamond nice--as big two--and quiet night! And does not he make jolly row morning, getting upon his four great legs! It is like thunder.” “You do not seem know diamond is.” “Oh, do not I just! Diamond great good horse; he sleeps right me. He old Diamond, I young Diamond; or, like better, you are particular, Mr. North Wind, he is big Diamond, I am little Diamond; I do not know us father likes best.” A beautiful laugh, large soft musical, sounded somewhere beside him, Diamond kept his head clothes. “I am Mr. North Wind,” said voice. “You told North Wind,” insisted Diamond. “I say Mister North Wind,” said voice. “Well, then, I do; mother tells I ought polite.” “Then let tell I do not think polite say Mister me.” “Well, I did not know better. I am sorry.” “But ought know better.” “I do not know that.” “I do. You cannot say it is polite lie talking--with head bed-clothes, never look see kind person talking to.--I want come me.” “I want go sleep,” said Diamond, nearly crying, he like scolded, even he deserved it. “You shall sleep better to-morrow night.” “Besides,” said Diamond, “you Mr. Dyves's garden, I cannot get there. I get yard.” “Will take head bed-clothes?” said voice, little angrily. “No!” answered Diamond, half peevish, half frightened. The instant he said word, tremendous blast wind crashed board wall, swept clothes Diamond. He started terror. Leaning large, beautiful, pale face woman. Her dark eyes looked little angry, begun flash; quivering her sweet upper lip made her look she going cry. What strange away her head streamed her black hair every direction, darkness hay-loft looked made her hair Diamond gazed her speechless amazement, mingled confidence--for boy entranced her mighty beauty--her hair began gather darkness, fell her again, till her face looked midst like moon cloud. From her eyes came light Diamond saw her face her hair; he see her yet. The wind gone. “Will go now, little Diamond? I sorry I forced rough you,” said lady. “I will; yes, I will,” answered Diamond, holding his arms. “But,” he added, dropping them, “how shall I get clothes? They mother's room, door locked.” “Oh, never mind clothes. You cold. I shall take care that. Nobody cold north wind.” “I thought everybody was,” said Diamond. “That great mistake. Most people make it, however. They cold north wind, without it.” If Diamond little older, supposed good deal wiser, he would thought lady joking. But he older, fancy wiser, therefore understood her well enough. Again he stretched his arms. The lady's face drew back little. “Follow me, Diamond,” she said. “Yes,” said Diamond, little ruefully. “You are afraid?” said North Wind. “No, madam; mother never would let go without shoes: she never said anything clothes, I dare say she would not mind that.” “I know mother well,” said lady. “She good woman. I visited her often. I her born. I saw her laugh cry once. I love mother, Diamond.” “How know name, then, madam? Please I say madam you, madam?” “One question time, dear boy. I knew name quite well, I wanted hear would say it. Do not remember day man finding fault name--how I blew window in?” “Yes, yes,” answered Diamond, eagerly. “Our window opens like door, right coach-house door. And wind--you, madam--came in, blew Bible man's hands, leaves went flutter, flutter floor, mother picked gave back open, there----” “Was name Bible--the sixth stone high priest's breastplate.” “Oh!--a stone, it?” said Diamond. “I thought horse--I did.” “Never mind. A horse better stone day. Well, see, I know mother.” “Yes. I go you.” “Now next question: you are call madam. You must call name--respectfully, know--just North Wind.” “Well, please, North Wind, beautiful, I quite ready go you.” “You must ready go everything beautiful once, Diamond.” “But what is beautiful cannot bad. You are bad, North Wind?” “No; I am bad. But sometimes beautiful things grow bad bad, takes time badness spoil beauty. So little boys may mistaken go things beautiful.” “Well, I go beautiful good, too.” “Ah, there is another thing, Diamond:--What I look ugly without bad--look ugly I making ugly things beautiful?--What then?” “I do not quite understand you, North Wind. You tell then.” “Well, I tell you. If see face black, do not frightened. If see flapping wings like bat's, big whole sky, do not frightened. If hear raging ten times worse Mrs. Bill, blacksmith's wife--even see looking people's windows like Mrs. Eve Dropper, gardener's wife--you must believe I work. Nay, Diamond, I change serpent tiger, must let go hold me, hand never change keep good hold. If keep hold, know I time, even look cannot see least like North Wind. I may look something awful. Do understand?” “Quite well,” said little Diamond. “Come along, then,” said North Wind, disappeared behind mountain hay. Diamond crept bed followed her. CHAPTER II. THE LAWN WHEN Diamond got round corner hay, moment he hesitated. The stair he would naturally gone door side loft, looked black indeed; full North Wind's hair, she descended him. And beside ladder going straight stable, his father always came fetch hay Diamond's dinner. Through opening floor faint gleam the-stable lantern enticing, Diamond thought he would run way. The stair went close past loose-box Diamond horse lived. When Diamond boy half-way down, he remembered use go way, stable-door locked. But moment horse Diamond's great head poked his box ladder, he knew boy Diamond although he his night-gown, wanted pull his ears him. This Diamond gently minute so, patted stroked his neck too, kissed big horse, begun take bits straw hay his mane, he recollected Lady North Wind waiting yard. “Good night, Diamond,” he said, darted ladder, across loft, stair door. But he got yard, lady. Now always dreadful thing think somebody find nobody. Children particular made minds it; generally cry nobody, especially wake night. But especial disappointment Diamond, his little heart beating joy: face North Wind grand! To lady like friend--with long hair, too! Why, longer twenty Diamonds' tails! She gone. And he stood, his bare feet stones paved yard. It clear night overhead, stars shining. Orion particular making his bright belt golden sword. But moon poor thin crescent. There one great, jagged, black gray cloud sky, steep side like precipice; moon side, looked she tumbled top cloud-hill, broken herself rolling precipice. She seem comfortable, she looking deep pit waiting her. At least Diamond thought he stood moment staring her. But he quite wrong, moon afraid, pit she going into, sides it, pit without sides pit all. Diamond, however, late his life, things looked strange him!--just he got Fairyland, he knew quite much anybody; his mother money buy books set wrong subject. I seen world--only sometimes, then, know--look strange ever I saw Fairyland. But I confess I yet seen Fairyland best. I always going see time. But face back North Wind, cold rather frosty night, night-gown, would felt quite strange Diamond did. He cried little, little, he disappointed lose lady: course, you, little man, would not done that! But part, I do not mind people crying much I mind cry about, cry--whether cry quietly like ladies gentlemen, go shrieking like vulgar emperors, ill-natured cooks; emperors gentlemen, cooks ladies--nor queens princesses matter, either. But cannot denied little gentle crying one good. It Diamond good; soon he brave boy again. “She shall not say fault, anyhow!” said Diamond. “I daresay she hiding somewhere see I do. I look her.” So he went round end stable towards kitchen-garden. But moment he clear shelter stable, sharp knife came wind his little chest his bare legs. Still he would look kitchen-garden, went on. But he got round weeping-ash stood corner, wind blew much stronger, grew stronger stronger till he could hardly fight it. And cold! All flashy spikes stars seemed got somehow wind. Then he thought lady said people cold North Wind. How he guessed she meant moment I cannot tell, I observed wonderful thing world people come understand anything. He turned his back wind, trotted towards yard; whereupon, strange say, blew much gently his calves blown his shins he began feel almost warm contrast. You must think cowardly Diamond turn his back wind: he he thought Lady North Wind said something like telling so. If she said he must hold his face it, Diamond would held his face it. But foolish thing fight good, please nobody. Well, wind pushing Diamond along. If he turned round, grew sharp his legs especially, he thought wind might really Lady North Wind, though he could see her, he better let her blow wherever she pleased. So she blew blew, he went went, he found standing door wall, door led yard little belt shrubbery, flanking Mr. Coleman's house. Mr. Coleman his father's master, owner Diamond. He opened door, went shrubbery, middle lawn, still hoping find North Wind. The soft grass pleasant his bare feet, felt warm stones yard; lady nowhere seen. Then he began think he must done wrong, she offended following close her, staying talk horse, certainly neither wise polite. There he stood middle lawn, wind blowing his night-gown till flapped like loose sail. The stars shiny his head; give light enough show grass green; Diamond stood alone strange night, looked half solid him. He began wonder whether he dream not. It important determine this; “for,” thought Diamond, “if I dream, I safe bed, I need not cry. But I am dream, I am here, perhaps I better cry, or, least, I am sure whether I help it.” He came conclusion, however, that, whether he dream not, could harm crying little longer: he could begin whenever he liked. The back Mr. Coleman's house lawn, one drawing-room windows looked upon it. The ladies gone bed; light still shining window. But idea little boy standing lawn his night-gown, would run moment. And long he saw light, Diamond could feel quite lonely. He stood staring, great warrior Orion sky, yet disconsolate, neglected moon going west, drawing-room window light shining green curtains. He room twice he could remember Christmas times; Colemans kind people, though care much children. All light went nearly out: he could see glimmer shape window. Then, indeed, he felt he left alone. It dreadful night everybody gone bed! That he could bear. He burst crying good earnest, beginning wail like wind waking up. Perhaps think foolish; could he go home his bed he liked? Yes; looked dreadful creep stair lie his bed again, know North Wind's window open beside him, she gone, he might never see her again. He would lonely here. Nay, would much worse he think window nothing hole wall. At moment he burst crying, old nurse grown one family, she gone away Miss Coleman want nursing, came back door, glass, close shutters. She thought she heard cry, and, peering hand side her eyes like Diamond's blinkers, she saw something white lawn. Too old wise frightened, she opened door, went straight towards white thing see was. And Diamond saw her coming he frightened either, though Mrs. Crump little cross sometimes; good kind crossness disagreeable, bad kind crossness nasty indeed. So she came her neck stretched out, her head end it, her eyes foremost all, like snail's, peering night see could went glimmering white her. When she see, she made great exclamation, threw her hands. Then without word, she thought Diamond walking his sleep, she caught hold him, led towards house. He made objection, he mood grateful notice sort, Mrs. Crump led straight drawing-room. Now, neglect new housemaid, fire Miss Coleman's bedroom gone out, her mother told her brush her hair drawing-room fire--a disorderly proceeding mother's wish could justify. The young lady lovely, though nearly beautiful North Wind; her hair extremely long, came her knees--though nothing North Wind's hair. Yet she looked round, her hair her, Diamond entered, he thought one moment North Wind, and, pulling his hand Mrs. Crump's, he stretched his arms ran towards Miss Coleman. She pleased she threw her brush, almost knelt floor receive her arms. He saw next moment she Lady North Wind, she looked like her he could help running her arms bursting tears afresh. Mrs. Crump said poor child walked his sleep, Diamond thought she ought know, contradict her anything he knew, might indeed. He let talk him, said nothing; when, astonishment over, Miss Coleman given sponge-cake, decreed Mrs. Crump take his mother, he quite satisfied. His mother get bed open door Mrs. Crump knocked. She indeed surprised see her, boy; taken her arms carried his bed, returned long confabulation Mrs. Crump, still talking Diamond fell fast asleep, could hear longer. CHAPTER III. OLD DIAMOND DIAMOND woke early morning, thought curious dream he had. But memory grew brighter brighter his head, look altogether like dream, he began doubt whether he really abroad wind last night. He came conclusion that, he really brought home his mother Mrs. Crump, she would say something it, would settle matter. Then he got dressed himself, but, finding his father mother yet stirring, he went ladder stable. There he found even old Diamond awake yet, he, well young Diamond, always got moment he woke, he lying flat horse could lie upon his nice trim bed straw. “I will give old Diamond surprise,” thought boy; creeping softly, horse knew, he astride his back. Then young Diamond's turn surprise he expected; earthquake, rumbling rocking hither thither, sprawling legs heaving many backs, young Diamond found hoisted air, hands twisted horse's mane. The next instant old Diamond lashed his hind legs, giving one cry terror young Diamond found lying his neck, his arms far round would go. But horse stood still stone, except he lifted his head gently let boy slip his back. For he heard young Diamond's cry he knew nothing kick about; young Diamond good boy, old Diamond good horse, one right back other. As soon Diamond got comfortable saddle place, horse began pulling hay, boy began thinking. He never mounted Diamond before, he never got without lifted down. So he sat, horse ate, wondering he reach ground. But he meditated, his mother woke, her first thought see her boy. She visited twice night, found sleeping quietly. Now his bed empty, she frightened. “Diamond! Diamond! Where you, Diamond?” she called out. Diamond turned his head he sat like knight his steed enchanted stall, cried aloud,-- “Here, mother!” “Where, Diamond?” she returned. “Here, mother, Diamond's back.” She came running ladder, peeping down, saw aloft great horse. “Come down, Diamond,” she said. “I cannot,” answered Diamond. “How get up?” asked his mother. “Quite easily,” answered he; “but I got up, Diamond would get too, I am.” His mother thought he walking his sleep again, hurried ladder. She much like going horse, she used horses; she would gone lion's den, say horse's stall, help her boy. So she went lifted Diamond's back, felt braver her life after. She carried her arms her room; but, afraid frightening his sleep-walking, she supposed it, said nothing last night. Before next day over, Diamond almost concluded whole adventure dream. For week his mother watched carefully--going loft several times night--as often, fact, she woke. Every time she found fast asleep. All week hard weather. The grass showed white morning hoar-frost clung like tiny comfits every blade. And Diamond's shoes good, his mother quite saved enough money get new pair she much wanted him, she would let run out. He played his games indoors, especially driving two chairs harnessed baby's cradle; go fast, went fast could expected best chairs world, although one three legs, half back. At length his mother brought home his new shoes, sooner she find fitted she told he might run yard amuse hour. The sun going he flew door like bird cage. All world new him. A great fire sunset burned top gate led stables house; fire sky lay large lake green light, golden cloud, blue wintry heavens. And Diamond thought that, next his home, he never seen place he would like much live sky. For fine things make home nice place, mother father. As he looking lovely colours, gates thrown open, old Diamond his friend carriage, dancing impatience get stalls oats. And came. Diamond least afraid his father driving him, but, careful spoil grand show he made his fine horses his multitudinous cape, red edge every fold, he slipped way let dash right stables. To quite safe he step recess door led yard shrubbery. As he stood he remembered wind driven spot night his dream. And he almost sure dream. At events, he would go see whether things looked then. He opened door, passed little belt shrubbery. Not flower seen beds lawn. Even brave old chrysanthemums Christmas roses passed away frost. What? Yes! There one! He ran knelt look it. It primrose--a dwarfish thing, perfect shape--a baby-wonder. As he stooped his face see close, little wind began blow, two three long leaves stood behind flower shook waved quivered, primrose lay still green hollow, looking sky, seeming know wind blowing all. It one eye dull black wintry earth opened look sky with. All Diamond thought saying prayers, he ought staring so. He ran stable see his father make Diamond's bed. Then his father took his arms, carried ladder, set table going tea. “Miss poorly,” said Diamond's father. “Mis'ess doctor her to-day, she looked glum she came again. I a-watching see doctor said.” “And did not Miss look glum too?” asked his mother. “Not half glum Mis'ess,” returned coachman. “You see--” But he lowered his voice, Diamond could make word there. For Diamond's father one finest coachmen look at, one best drivers, one discreet servants well. Therefore he talk family affairs one his wife, he proved better long ago, careful even Diamond hear nothing he could repeat concerning master his family. It bed-time soon, Diamond went bed fell fast asleep. He awoke once, dark. “Open window, Diamond,” said voice. Now Diamond's mother pasted North Wind's window. “Are North Wind?” said Diamond: “I do not hear blowing.” “No; hear talking. Open window, I have not overmuch time.” “Yes,” returned Diamond. “But, please, North Wind, where is use? You left alone last time.” He got his knees, busy his nails paper hole wall. For North Wind spoke again, he remembered taken place distinctly happened last night. “Yes, fault,” returned North Wind. “I work do; and, besides, gentleman never keep lady waiting.” “But I am gentleman,” said Diamond, scratching away paper. “I hope will not say ten years this.” “I am going coachman, coachman gentleman,” persisted Diamond. “We call father gentleman house,” said North Wind. “He does not call one,” said Diamond. “That is consequence: every man ought gentleman, father one.” Diamond pleased hear he scratched paper like ten mice, getting hold edge it, tore off. The next instant young girl glided across bed, stood upon floor. “Oh dear!” said Diamond, quite dismayed; “I did not know--who you, please?” “I am North Wind.” “Are really?” “Yes. Make haste.” “But you are bigger me.” “Do think I care big little I am? Did not see evening? I less then.” “No. Where you?” “Behind leaves primrose. Did not see blowing?” “Yes.” “Make haste, then, want go me.” “But big enough take care me. I think Miss North Wind.” “I big enough show way, anyhow. But will not come, why, must stay.” “I must dress myself. I did not mind grown lady, I could not go little girl night-gown.” “Very well. I am hurry I night. Dress fast can, I will go shake primrose leaves till come.” “Do not hurt it,” said Diamond. North Wind broke little laugh like breaking silver bubbles, gone moment. Diamond saw--for starlit night, mass hay low ebb now--the gleam something vanishing stair, and, springing bed, dressed fast ever he could. Then he crept yard, door wall, away primrose. Behind stood North Wind, leaning it, looking flower she mother. “Come along,” she said, jumping holding her hand. Diamond took her hand. It cold, pleasant full life, better warm. She led across garden. With one bound she top wall. Diamond left foot. “Stop, stop!” he cried. “Please, I cannot jump like that.” “You do not try” said North Wind, top looked foot taller before. “Give hand again, I will, try” said Diamond. She reached down, Diamond laid hold her hand, gave great spring, stood beside her. “This nice!” he said. Another bound, stood road river. It full tide, stars shining clear depths, lay still, waiting turn run sea. They walked along side. But walked far surface covered ripples, stars vanished bosom. And North Wind tall full-grown girl. Her hair flying her head, wind blowing breeze river. But she turned aside went narrow lane, she went her hair fell around her. “I rather disagreeable work to-night,” she said, “before I get sea, I must set once. The disagreeable work must looked first.” So saying, she laid hold Diamond began run, gliding along faster faster. Diamond kept her well he could. She made many turnings windings, apparently quite easy get walls houses. Once ran hall found back front doors open. At foot stair North Wind stood still, Diamond, hearing great growl, started terror, there, instead North Wind, huge wolf his side. He let go his hold dismay, wolf bounded stair. The windows house rattled shook guns firing, sound great fall came above. Diamond stood white face staring landing. “Surely,” he thought, “North Wind cannot eating one children!” Coming once, he rushed her his little fist clenched. There ladies long trains going stairs, gentlemen white neckties attending them, stared him, none people house, said nothing. Before he reached head stair, however, North Wind met him, took hand, hurried house. “I hope have not eaten baby, North Wind!” said Diamond, solemnly. North Wind laughed merrily, went tripping faster. Her grassy robe swept swirled her steps, wherever passed withered leaves, went fleeing whirling spirals, running edges like wheels, her feet. “No,” she said last, “I eat baby. You would ask foolish question let go hold me. You would seen I served nurse calling child bad names, telling her she wicked. She drinking. I saw ugly gin bottle cupboard.” “And frightened her?” said Diamond. “I believe so!” answered North Wind laughing merrily. “I flew her throat, she tumbled floor crash ran in. She will turned away to-morrow--and quite time, knew much I do.” “But did not frighten little one?” “She never saw me. The woman would seen either she wicked.” “Oh!” said Diamond, dubiously. “Why see things,” returned North Wind, “that would not understand know with? Good people see good things; bad people, bad things.” “Then bad thing?” “No. For see me, Diamond, dear,” said girl, she looked him, Diamond saw loving eyes great lady beaming depths her falling hair. “I make look like bad thing she could see me. If I put shape wolf's she would seen me, growing her shape inside her.” “I do not know mean,” said Diamond, “but I suppose it is right.” They climbing slope grassy ascent. It Primrose Hill, fact, although Diamond never heard it. The moment reached top, North Wind stood turned her face towards London The stars still shining clear cold overhead. There cloud seen. The air sharp, Diamond find cold. “Now,” said lady, “whatever do, let hand go. I might lost last time, I hurry then: I hurry.” Yet she stood still moment. CHAPTER IV. NORTH WIND AND she stood looking towards London, Diamond saw she trembling. “Are cold, North Wind?” he asked. “No, Diamond,” she answered, looking upon smile; “I getting ready sweep one rooms. Those careless, greedy, untidy children make mess.” As she spoke he could told her voice, he seen his eyes, she growing larger larger. Her head went towards stars; she grew, still trembling her body, her hair also grew--longer longer, lifted her head, went black waves. The next moment, however, fell back around her, she grew less less till she tall woman. Then she put her hands behind her head, gathered her hair, began weaving knotting together. When she done, she bent her beautiful face close his, said-- “Diamond, I afraid would keep hold me, I drop you, I do not know might happen; I making place hair. Come.” Diamond held his arms, grand face looking him, he believed like baby. She took her hands, threw her shoulder, said, “Get in, Diamond.” And Diamond parted her hair his hands, crept between, feeling soon found woven nest. It like pocket, like shawl gipsy women carry children. North Wind put her hands her back, felt nest, finding safe, said-- “Are comfortable, Diamond?” “Yes, indeed,” answered Diamond. The next moment he rising air. North Wind grew towering place clouds. Her hair went streaming her, till spread like mist stars. She flung herself abroad space. Diamond held two twisted ropes which, parted interwoven, formed his shelter, he could help little afraid. As soon he come himself, he peeped woven meshes, he dare look top nest. The earth rushing past like river sea him. Trees water green grass hurried away beneath. A great roar wild animals rose rushed Zoological Gardens, mixed chattering monkeys screaming birds; died away moment behind them. And nothing roofs houses, sweeping along like great torrent stones rocks. Chimney-pots fell, tiles flew roofs; looked left behind roofs chimneys scudded away. There great roaring, wind dashing London like sea; North Wind's back Diamond, course, felt nothing all. He perfect calm. He could hear sound it, all. By he raised looked edge his nest. There houses rushing shooting away him, like fierce torrent rocks instead water. Then he looked sky, could see stars; hidden blinding masses lady's hair swept between. He began wonder whether she would hear he spoke. He would try. “Please, North Wind,” he said, “what noise?” From high his head came voice North Wind, answering him, gently-- “The noise besom. I old woman sweeps cobwebs sky; I am busy floor now.” “What makes houses look running away?” “I sweeping fast them.” “But, please, North Wind, I knew London big, I did not know big this. It seems never get away it.” “We going round round, else left long ago.” “Is way sweep, North Wind?” “Yes; I go round round great besom.” “Please, would mind going little slower, I want see streets?” “You will not see much now.” “Why?” “Because I nearly swept people home.” “Oh! I forgot,” said Diamond, quiet that, he want troublesome. But she dropped little towards roofs houses, Diamond could see streets. There people about, though. The lamps flickered flared again, nobody seemed want them. Suddenly Diamond espied little girl coming along street. She dreadfully blown wind, broom she trailing behind her troublesome. It seemed wind spite her--it kept worrying her like wild beast, tearing her rags. She lonely there! “Oh! please, North Wind,” he cried, “will not help little girl?” “No, Diamond; I must not leave work.” “But should not kind her?” “I kind her. I sweeping wicked smells away.” “But you are kinder me, dear North Wind. Why should not kind her me?” “There reasons, Diamond. Everybody cannot done same. Everybody ready thing.” “But I do not see I kinder used she.” “Do think nothing's done see, Diamond, silly! It is right. Of course help her like. You have got nothing particular moment; I have.” “Oh! let help her, then. But will not able wait, perhaps?” “No, I cannot wait; must yourself. And, mind, wind get hold you, too.” “Do not want help her, North Wind?” “Not without idea happen. If break cry, will not much help her, make goose little Diamond.” “I want go,” said Diamond. “Only there is one thing--how I get home?” “If you are anxious that, perhaps better go me. I bound take home again, do.” “There!” cried Diamond, still looking little girl. “I am sure wind blow her over, perhaps kill her. Do let go.” They sweeping slowly along line street. There lull roaring. “Well, though I cannot promise take home,” said North Wind, she sank nearer nearer tops houses, “I promise right end. You get home somehow. Have made mind do?” “Yes; help little girl,” said Diamond firmly. The moment North Wind dropt street stood, tall lady, her hair flying housetops. She put her hands her back, took Diamond, set street. The moment he caught fierce coils blast, blown away. North Wind stepped back step, towered stature height houses. A chimney-pot clashed Diamond's feet. He turned terror, look little girl, he turned lady vanished, wind roaring along street bed invisible torrent. The little girl scudding blast, her hair flying too, behind her she dragged her broom. Her little legs going fast ever could keep her falling. Diamond crept shelter doorway, thinking stop her; she passed like bird, crying gently pitifully. “Stop! stop! little girl,” shouted Diamond, starting pursuit. “I cannot,” wailed girl, “the wind will not leave go me.” Diamond could run faster she, he broom. In moments he caught her frock, tore his hand, away went little girl. So he run again, time he ran fast he got her, turning round caught her his arms, went together, made little girl laugh midst her crying. “Where going?” asked Diamond, rubbing elbow stuck farthest out. The arm belonged twined round lamp-post he stood little girl wind. “Home,” she said, gasping breath. “Then I go you,” said Diamond. And silent while, wind blew worse ever, hold lamp-post. “Where crossing?” asked girl length. “I do not sweep,” answered Diamond. “What do, then?” asked she. “You are not big enough things.” “I do not know I do,” answered he, feeling rather ashamed. “Nothing, I suppose. My father's Mr. Coleman's coachman.” “Have father?” she said, staring boy father natural curiosity. “Yes. Have not you?” returned Diamond. “No; mother neither. Old Sal's I have got.” And she began cry again. “I would not go her she was not good me,” said Diamond. “But must go somewheres.” “Move on,” said voice policeman behind them. “I told so,” said girl. “You must go somewheres. They are always it.” “But old Sal does not beat you, she?” “I wish she would.” “What mean?” asked Diamond, quite bewildered. “She would she mother. But she would not lie abed a-cuddlin' her ugly old bones, laugh hear crying door.” “You do not mean she will not let to-night?” “It will good chance she does.” “Why late, then?” asked Diamond. “My crossing's long way West End, I indulgin' door-steps mewses.” “We would better try anyhow,” said Diamond. “Come along.” As he spoke Diamond thought he caught glimpse North Wind turning corner front them; turned corner too, found quiet there, he saw nothing lady. “Now lead me,” he said, taking her hand, “and I will take care you.” The girl withdrew her hand, dry her eyes her frock, enough her broom. She put his again, led him, turning turning, stopped cellar-door dirty lane. There she knocked. “I should not like live here,” said Diamond. “Oh, yes, would, nowhere else go to,” answered girl. “I wish may get in.” “I do not want go in,” said Diamond. “Where mean go, then?” “Home home.” “Where is that?” “I do not exactly know.” “Then you are worse I am.” “Oh no, North Wind--” began Diamond, stopped, he hardly knew why. “What?” said girl, she held her ear door listening. But Diamond reply. Neither old Sal. “I told so,” said girl. “She wide awake hearkening. But do not get in.” “What do, then?” asked Diamond. “Move on,” she answered. “Where?” “Oh, anywheres. Bless you, I am used it.” “Had not better come home me, then?” “That is good joke, do not know is. Come on.” “But where?” “Oh, nowheres particular. Come on.” Diamond obeyed. The wind fallen considerably. They wandered on, turning direction that, without reason one way another, got thick houses waste kind place. By time tired. Diamond felt good deal inclined cry, thought he silly get back North Wind; he would minded he done girl good; he thought he use her. He mistaken there, she far happier Diamond her she wandering alone. She seem tired he was. “Do let us rest bit,” said Diamond. “Let us see,” she answered. “There is something like railway there. Perhaps there is open arch.” They went towards found one, and, better still, empty barrel lying arch. “Hallo! are!” said girl. “A barrel's jolliest bed going--on tramp, I mean. We will forty winks, go again.” She crept in, Diamond crept beside her. They put arms round other, he began grow warm, Diamond's courage began come back. “This jolly!” he said. “I am glad!” “I do not think much it,” said girl. “I am used it, I suppose. But I cannot think kid like comes alone time night.” She called kid, she really month older he was; she work her bread, soon makes people older. “But I should not late I had not got help you,” said Diamond. “North Wind gone home long ago.” “I think must ha' got one Hidget Asylms,” said girl. “You said something north wind afore I could not get rights of.” So now, sake his character, Diamond tell her whole story. She believe word it. She said he was not flat believe bosh. But she spoke came great blast wind arch, set barrel rolling. So made haste get it, notion rolled packed tight would not hurt, like barrel herrings. “I thought sleep,” said Diamond; “but I cannot say I am sleepy all. Come, let us go again.” They wandered on, sometimes sitting door-step, always turning lanes fields chance. They found last rising ground sloped rather steeply side. It waste kind spot below, bounded irregular wall, doors it. Outside lay broken things general, garden rollers flower-pots wine-bottles. But moment reached brow rising ground, gust wind seized blew hill fast could run. Nor could Diamond stop he went bang one doors wall. To his dismay burst open. When came peeped in. It back door garden. “Ah, ah!” cried Diamond, staring moments, “I thought so! North Wind takes nobody in! Here I master's garden! I tell what, little girl, bore hole old Sal's wall, put mouth it, say, 'Please, North Wind, may not I go you?' you will see what will come.” “I daresay I shall. But I am wind often already want it.” “I said North Wind, it.” “It is one.” “It is one.” “It one.” “But I know best.” “And I know better. I will box ears,” said girl. Diamond got angry. But he remembered even she box his ears, he musn't box again, she girl, boys must do, girls rude, go away leave them. So he went door. “Good-bye, mister” said girl. This brought Diamond his senses. “I am sorry I cross,” he said. “Come in, mother give breakfast.” “No, thank you. I must crossing. It is morning now.” “I am sorry you,” said Diamond. “Well, life tired of--what old Sal, many holes shoes.” “I wonder you are good. I kill myself.” “Oh, no, would not! When I think it, I always want see what is coming next, I always wait till next over. Well! I suppose there is somebody happy somewheres. But are not carriages. Oh my! look sometimes--fit bite head off! Good-bye!” She ran hill disappeared behind it. Then Diamond shut door he best could, ran kitchen-garden stable. And was not he glad get his blessed bed again! CHAPTER V. THE SUMMER-HOUSE DIAMOND said nothing his mother his adventures. He half notion North Wind friend his mother, that, she know it, least she mind his going anywhere lady wind. At time he doubted whether he might appear telling stories he told all, especially he could hardly believe he thought middle day, although twilight half-way night he doubt it, least first days he her. The girl swept crossing certainly refused believe him. Besides, he felt sure North Wind would tell he ought speak. It time he saw lady wind again. Indeed nothing remarkable took place Diamond's history following week. This happened then. Diamond horse wanted new shoes, Diamond's father took stable, getting his back ride forge, he saw his little boy standing pump, looking wistfully. Then coachman took his foot stirrup, left his hold mane bridle, came across his boy, lifted up, setting horse's back, told sit like man. He led away Diamonds together. The boy atop felt little tremulous great muscles lifted legs horse knotted relaxed his legs, he cowered towards withers, grasping his hands bit mane worn short collar; his father looked back him, saying more, “Sit up, Diamond,” he let mane go sat up, notwithstanding horse, thinking, I suppose, his master said him, “Come up, Diamond,” stepped faster. For Diamonds grandly obedient. And Diamond soon found that, he obedient his father, horse obedient him. For he ridden far he found courage reach forward catch hold bridle, his father, whose hand upon it, felt boy pull towards him, he looked smiled, and, well pleased, let go his hold, left Diamond guide Diamond; boy soon found he could perfectly. It grand thing able guide great beast like that. And another discovery he made that, order guide horse, he measure obey horse first. If he yield his body motions horse's body, he could guide him; he must fall off. The blacksmith lived distance, deeper London. As crossed angle square, Diamond, quite comfortable his living throne, glancing way gentle pride, he saw girl sweeping crossing scuddingly lady. The lady his father's mistress, Mrs. Coleman, little girl she whose sake he got North Wind's back. He drew Diamond's bridle eager anxiety see whether her outstretched hand would gather penny Mrs. Coleman. But she given one last crossing, hand returned grasp broom. Diamond could bear it. He penny his pocket, gift lady day before, he tumbled his horse give girl. He tumbled off, I say, he tumble he reached ground. But he got instant, ran, searching his pocket he ran. She made pretty courtesy he offered his treasure, bewildered stare. She thought first: “Then he back North Wind all!” but, looking sound horse's feet paved crossing, she changed her idea, saying herself, “North Wind his father's horse! That is secret it! Why could not he say so?” And she mind refuse penny. But his smile put right, she took his penny put her mouth “Thank you, mister. Did wollop then?” “Oh no!” answered Diamond. “They never wollops me.” “Lor!” said little girl, speechless. Meantime his father, looking up, seeing horse's back bare, suffered pang awful dread, next moment catching sight him, took put on, saying-- “Do not get again, Diamond. The horse might put his foot you.” “No, father,” answered boy, rode majestic safety. The summer drew near, warm splendid. Miss Coleman little better health, sat good deal garden. One day she saw Diamond peeping shrubbery, called him. He talked her frankly she often sent that, degrees came he leave run garden he pleased. He never touched flowers blossoms, he like boys cannot enjoy thing without pulling pieces, preventing every one enjoying them. A week even makes long time child's life, Diamond begun feel North Wind dream far-off year. One hot evening, he sitting young mistress, called her, little summer-house bottom lawn--a wonderful thing beauty, boy thought, little window side made coloured glass. It grew dusky, lady began feel chill, went in, leaving boy summer-house. He sat gazing bed tulips, which, although closed night, could go quite asleep wind kept waving about. All he saw great bumble-bee fly one tulips. “There! something done,” said voice--a gentle, merry, childish voice, tiny. “At last was. I thought he would stay night, poor fellow! I did.” Diamond could tell whether voice near far away, small yet clear. He never seen fairy, he heard such, he began look one. And tiniest creature sliding stem tulip! “Are fairy herds bees?” he asked, going summer-house, his knees green shore tulip-bed. “I am fairy,” answered little creature. “How know that?” “It would become better ask know it.” “You have told me.” “Yes. But what is use knowing thing you are told it?” “Well, I know fairy? You look like one.” “In first place, fairies much bigger see me.” “Oh!” said Diamond reflectively; “I thought little.” “But might tremendously bigger I am, yet big. Why, I could six times size I am, huge. Besides, fairy cannot grow big little will, though nursery-tales say so: do not know better. You stupid Diamond! never seen before?” And, she spoke, moan wind bent tulips almost ground, creature laid her hand Diamond's shoulder. In moment he knew North Wind. “I stupid,” he said; “but I never saw small before, even nursing primrose.” “Must see every size measured know me, Diamond?” “But could I think taking care great stupid bumble-bee?” “The stupid he need he taken care of. What sucking honey trying open door, he nearly dated; opened morning let sun see tulip's heart, would sun thought find stupid thing lying there--with wings too?” “But time look bees?” “I do not look bees. I one look after. It hard work, though.” “Hard work! Why, could blow chimney down, or--or boy's cap off,” said Diamond. “Both easier blow tulip open. But I scarcely know difference hard easy. I always able I do. When I see work, I rush it--and done. But I must not chatter. I got sink ship to-night.” “Sink ship! What! men it?” “Yes, women too.” “How dreadful! I wish would not talk so.” “It rather dreadful. But work. I must it.” “I hope will not ask go you.” “No, I will not ask you. But must come that.” “I will not then.” “Will not you?” And North Wind grew tall lady, looked eyes, Diamond said-- “Please take me. You cannot cruel.” “No; I could cruel I would. I nothing cruel, although I often looks like cruel know I really doing. The people say I drown, I carry away to--to--to--well, back North Wind--that used call long ago, I never saw place.” “How carry never saw it?” “I know way.” “But never saw it?” “Because behind me.” “But look round.” “Not far enough see back. No; I always look me. In fact, I grow quite blind deaf I try see back. I mind work.” “But work?” “Ah, I cannot tell you. I know is, I I feel right, I do not I feel wrong. East Wind says--only one exactly know much believe she says, she naughty sometimes--she says managed baby; whether she good naughty she says that, I do not know. I stick work. It one let bee tulip, sweep cobwebs sky. You would like go to-night?” “I do not want see ship sunk.” “But suppose I take you?” “Why, then, course I must go.” “There is good Diamond.--I think I better growing bit. Only must go bed first. I cannot take till you are bed. That is law children. So I better go something else first.” “Very well, North Wind,” said Diamond. “What going first, please?” “I think I may tell you. Jump top wall, there.” “I cannot.” “Ah! I cannot help you--you have not bed yet, see. Come road me, front coach-house, I show you.” North Wind grew small indeed, small she could blown dust dusty miller, Scotch children call yellow auricula. Diamond could even see blades grass move she flitted along his foot. They left lawn, went wicket the-coach-house gates, crossed road low wall separated river. “You get wall, Diamond,” said North Wind. “Yes; mother forbidden me.” “Then do not,” said North Wind. “But I see over,” said Diamond. “Ah! sure. I cannot.” So saying, North Wind gave little bound, stood top wall. She height dragon-fly would be, stood end. “You darling!” said Diamond, seeing lovely little toy-woman she was. “Do not impertinent, Master Diamond,” said North Wind. “If there is one thing makes angry another, way humans judge things size. I quite respectable I shall six hours this, I take East Indiaman royals, twist her round, push her under. You right address fashion.” But she spoke, tiny face wore smile great, grand woman. She her beautiful fun Diamond, true woman's fun never hurts. “But look there!” she resumed. “Do see boat one man it--a green white boat?” “Yes; quite well.” “That is poet.” “I thought said bo-at.” “Stupid pet! Do not know poet is?” “Why, thing sail water in.” “Well, perhaps you are far wrong. Some poets carry people sea. But I business talk much. The man poet.” “The boat boat,” said Diamond. “Cannot spell?” asked North Wind. “Not well.” “So I see. A poet bo-at, call it. A poet man glad something, tries make people glad too.” “Ah! I know. Like man sweety-shop.” “Not very. But I see use. I was not sent tell you, I cannot tell you. I must off. Only first look man.” “He is much rower” said Diamond--“paddling first one fin other.” “Now look here!” said North Wind. And she flashed like dragon-fly across water, whose surface rippled puckered she passed. The next moment man boat glanced him, bent his oars. The boat flew rippling water. Man boat river awake. The instant almost, North Wind perched upon river wall. “How that?” asked Diamond. “I blew his face,” answered North Wind. “I do not see could it,” said Diamond. “I daresay not. And therefore say do not believe could.” “No, no, dear North Wind. I know well believe you.” “Well, I blew his face, woke up.” “But good it?” “Why! do not see? Look him--how he pulling. I blew mist him.” “How that?” “That I cannot tell you.” “But it.” “Yes. I ten thousand things without able tell how.” “I do not like that,” said Diamond. He staring boat. Hearing answer, he looked wall. North Wind gone. Away across river went long ripple--what sailors call cat's paw. The man boat putting sail. The moon coming herself edge great cloud, sail began shine white. Diamond rubbed his eyes, wondered about. Things seemed going around him, understand other, he could make nothing it. So he put his hands his pockets, went his tea. The night hot, wind fallen again. “You do not seem well to-night, Diamond,” said his mother. “I quite well, mother,” returned Diamond, puzzled. “I think better go bed,” she added. “Very well, mother,” he answered. He stopped one moment look window. Above moon clouds going different ways. Somehow troubled him, but, notwithstanding, he soon fast asleep. He woke middle night darkness. A terrible noise rumbling overhead, like rolling beat great drums echoing brazen vault. The roof loft he lay ceiling; tiles sky. For he could come quite awake, noise kept beating down, his heart troubled fluttered painfully. A second peal thunder burst his head, almost choked fear. Nor he recover great blast followed, torn tiles roof, sent spout wind his bed his face, brought wide awake, gave back his courage. The moment he heard mighty yet musical voice calling him. “Come up, Diamond,” said. “It is ready. I am waiting you.” He looked bed, saw gigantic, powerful, lovely arm--with hand whose fingers nothing less ladylike could strangled boa-constrictor, choked tigress prey--stretched big hole roof. Without moment's hesitation he reached his tiny one, laid grand palm him. CHAPTER VI. OUT IN THE STORM THE hand felt way his arm, and, grasping gently strongly elbow, lifted Diamond bed. The moment he hole roof, winds heaven seemed lay hold upon him, buffet hither thither. His hair blew one way, his night-gown another, his legs threatened float him, his head grow dizzy swiftness invisible assailant. Cowering, he clung hand huge hand held his arm, fear invaded his heart. “Oh, North Wind!” he murmured, words vanished his lips he seen soap-bubbles burst soon vanish mouth his pipe. The wind caught them, nowhere. They could not get all, torn away strangled. And yet North Wind heard them, her answer seemed Diamond she big could help it, her ear her mouth must seem dreadfully far away, she spoke tenderly graciously ever before. Her voice like bass deep organ, without groan it; like delicate violin tones without wail it; like glorious trumpet-ejaculations without defiance it; like sound falling water without clatter clash it: like neither them--all without faults, without peculiarity: all, like his mother's voice anything else world. “Diamond, dear,” she said, “be man. What fearful least fearful me.” “But cannot hurt you,” murmured Diamond, “for you are it.” “Then I am it, arms, hurt you?” “Oh yes! I see,” whispered Diamond. “But looks dreadful, pushes so.” “Yes, does, dear. That sent for.” At moment, peal thunder shook Diamond's heart sides his bosom hurtled heavens: I cannot say sky, sky. Diamond seen lightning, he intent finding face North Wind. Every moment folds her garment would sweep across his eyes blind him, between, he could persuade he saw great glories woman's eyes looking rifts mountainous clouds his head. He trembled thunder, his knees failed him, he sunk North Wind's feet, clasped her round column her ankle. She instantly stooped, lifted roof--up--up her bosom, held there, saying, inconsolable child-- “Diamond, dear, never do.” “Oh yes, will,” answered Diamond. “I right now--quite comfortable, I assure you, dear North Wind. If let stay here, I shall right indeed.” “But feel wind here, Diamond.” “I do not mind bit, long I feel arms it,” answered Diamond, nestling closer her grand bosom. “Brave boy!” returned North Wind, pressing closer. “No,” said Diamond, “I do not see that. It is courage all, long I feel there.” “But had not better get hair? Then would feel wind; here.” “Ah, but, dear North Wind, do not know nice feel arms me. It thousand times better wind together, hair back neck wind all.” “But surely comfortable there?” “Well, perhaps; I begin think better things comfortable.” “Yes, indeed are. Well, I keep front me. You feel wind, much. I shall want one arm take care you; quite enough sink ship.” “Oh, dear North Wind! talk so?” “My dear boy, I never talk; I always mean I say.” “Then mean sink ship hand?” “Yes.” “It is like you.” “How know that?” “Quite easily. Here taking care poor little boy one arm, sinking ship other. It cannot like you.” “Ah! me? I cannot two mes, know.” “No. Nobody two mes.” “Well, me?” “Now I must think. There looks two.” “Yes. That is point.--You cannot knowing thing do not know, you?” “No.” “Which know?” “The kindest, goodest, best world,” answered Diamond, clinging North Wind. “Why I good you?” “I do not know.” “Have ever done anything me?” “No.” “Then I must good I choose good you.” “Yes.” “Why I choose?” “Because--because--because like.” “Why I like good you?” “I do not know, except it is good good me.” “That is it; I good I like good.” “Then should not good people well me?” “That is I do not know. Why should not I?” “I do not know either. Then should not you?” “Because I am.” “There again,” said Diamond. “I do not see are. It looks quite thing.” “Well, listen me, Diamond. You know one me, say, good.” “Yes.” “Do know well?” “No. I cannot. I should not like to.” “There is. You do not know me. You sure one them?” “Yes.” “And sure cannot two mes?” “Yes.” “Then do not know must know,--else would two mes?” “Yes.” “Then do not know must kind know?” “Yes.” “Besides, I tell so, does not look like it. That I confess freely. Have anything object?” “No, no, dear North Wind; I quite satisfied.” “Then I tell something might object. You might say know like me, I cruel through.” “I know cannot be, kind.” “But kindness might pretence sake cruel afterwards.” Diamond clung her tighter ever, crying-- “No, no, dear North Wind; I cannot believe that. I do not believe it. I will not believe it. That would kill me. I love you, must love me, else I come love you? How could know put beautiful face love rest? No. You may sink many ships like, I will not say another word. I cannot say I shall like see it, know.” “That is quite another thing,” said North Wind; she spoke she gave one spring roof hay-loft, rushed clouds, Diamond her left arm close her heart. And clouds knew she come, burst fresh jubilation thunderous light. For moments, Diamond seemed borne depths ocean dazzling flame; next, winds writhing around like storm serpents. For midst clouds mists, course took shapes wind, eddying wreathing whirling shooting dashing like grey black water, wind taken shape, he saw grey black wind tossing raving madly him. Now blinded smiting upon eyes; deafened bellowing his ears; even thunder came he knew billows great ocean air dashing haste fill hollow scooped lightning; took his breath quite away sucking his body speed rush. But he mind it. He gasped first laughed, arm North Wind him, he leaning her bosom. It quite impossible describe he saw. Did ever watch great wave shoot winding passage amongst rocks? If ever did, would see water rushed every way once, even turning back opposing rest; greater confusion might see nowhere except crowd frightened people. Well, wind like that, except went much faster, therefore much wilder, twisted shot curled dodged clashed raved ten times madly anything else creation except human passions. Diamond saw threads lady's hair streaking all. In parts indeed he could tell hair black storm vapour. It seemed sometimes great billows mist-muddy wind woven crossing lines North Wind's infinite hair, sweeping endless intertwistings. And Diamond felt wind seized his hair, his mother kept rather long, he part storm, life went him. But sheltered he North Wind's arm bosom times, fiercer onslaught curl-billowed eddy, he recognise moment wild storm he carried, nestling core formative centre. It seemed Diamond likewise motionless centre, confusion fighting went around them. Flash flash illuminated fierce chaos, revealing varied yellow blue grey dusky red vapourous contention; peal peal thunder tore infinite waste; seemed Diamond North Wind he motionless, hair. It so. They sweeping speed wind towards sea. CHAPTER VII. THE CATHEDRAL I MUST go describing cannot described, nothing wearisome. Before reached sea, Diamond felt North Wind's hair beginning fall him. “Is storm over, North Wind?” he called out. “No, Diamond. I waiting moment set down. You would like see ship sunk, I going give place stop till I come back you.” “Oh! thank you,” said Diamond. “I shall sorry leave you, North Wind, I would rather see ship go down. And I am afraid poor people cry, I hear them. Oh, dear!” “There good many passengers board; tell truth, Diamond, I do not care hearing cry speak of. I afraid would get little head long time.” “But bear then, North Wind? For I sure kind. I shall never doubt again.” “I tell I able bear it, Diamond: I always hearing, every noise, noise I making even, sound far-off song. I exactly know is, means; I do not hear much it, odour music, were, flitting across great billows ocean outside air I make storm; I hear quite enough make able bear cry drowning ship. So would could hear it.” “No, would not,” returned Diamond, stoutly. “For would not hear music far-away song; did, would not good. You see I going drowned, might enjoy it.” “But never heard psalm, do not know like. Somehow, I cannot say how, tells right; coming swallow cries.” “But will not good--the people, I mean,” persisted Diamond. “It must. It must,” said North Wind, hurriedly. “It would not song seems swallow fear pain too, set singing rest. I sure will. And know, ever since I knew I hair, is, ever since began go away, song coming nearer nearer. Only I must say thousand years I heard it.” “But say coming nearer hear it?” asked doubting little Diamond. “Since I began hear it, I know growing louder, therefore I judge coming nearer nearer I hear first. I am old, know--a thousand years only--and I quite baby I heard noise first, I knew must come voices people ever much older wiser I was. I cannot sing all, except then, I never tell song going be; I know I sung it.--But never do. Will stop here?” “I cannot see anywhere stop,” said Diamond. “Your hair like darkness, I cannot see I knock eyes ever much.” “Look, then,” said North Wind; and, one sweep her great white arm, she swept yards deep darkness like great curtain face boy. And lo! blue night, lit stars. Where shine stars shimmered milk stars, except where, opposite Diamond's face, grey towers cathedral blotted shape sky stars. “Oh! what is that?” cried Diamond, struck kind terror, he never seen cathedral, rose awful reality midst wide spaces, conquering emptiness grandeur. “A good place wait in,” said North Wind. “But shall go in, shall judge yourself.” There open door middle one towers, leading upon roof, passed. Then North Wind set Diamond his feet, he found top stone stair, went twisting away darkness little light came door. It enough, however, allow Diamond see North Wind stood beside him. He looked find her face, saw she longer beautiful giantess, tall gracious lady he liked best see. She took his hand, and, giving broad part spiral stair walk on, led good way; then, opening another little door, led upon narrow gallery ran round central part church, ledges windows clerestory, openings parts wall divided windows other. It narrow, except passing wall, Diamond saw nothing keep falling church. It lay like great silent gulf hollowed stone, he held his breath fear he looked down. “What trembling for, little Diamond?” said lady, she walked gently along, her hand held behind her leading him, breadth enough walk side side. “I afraid falling there,” answered Diamond. “It deep down.” “Yes, rather,” answered North Wind; “but hundred times higher minutes ago.” “Ah, yes, somebody is arm then,” said Diamond, putting his little mouth beautiful cold hand hold his. “What dear little warm mouth you have got!” said North Wind. “It pity talk nonsense it. Do not know I hold you?” “Yes; I am walking legs, might slip. I cannot trust well arms.” “But I hold you, I tell you, foolish child.” “Yes, somehow I cannot feel comfortable.” “If fall, hold give way, I less moment lady's watch tick, catch long reached ground.” “I do not like though,” said Diamond. “Oh! oh! oh!” he screamed next moment, bent double terror, North Wind let go her hold his hand, vanished, leaving standing rooted gallery. She left words, “Come me,” sounding his ears. But move he dared not. In moment he would terror fallen church, suddenly came gentle breath cool wind upon his face, kept blowing upon little puffs, every puff Diamond felt his faintness going away, his fear it. Courage reviving his little heart, still cool wafts soft wind breathed upon him, soft wind mighty strong within gentleness, minute Diamond marching along narrow ledge fearless time North Wind herself. He walked on, windows row one side him, great empty nave church echoing every one his brave strides other, last he came little open door, broader stair led down, till last he found arms North Wind, held close her, kissed forehead. Diamond nestled her, murmured her bosom,--“Why leave me, dear North Wind?” “Because I wanted walk alone,” she answered. “But much nicer here!” said Diamond. “I daresay; I could not hold little coward heart. It would make cold!” “But I was not brave myself,” said Diamond, older readers already discovered true child this, he given metaphysics. “It wind blew face made brave. Was not now, North Wind?” “Yes: I know that. You taught courage was. And could not know without feeling it: therefore given you. But do not feel would try brave next time?” “Yes, I do. But trying much.” “Yes, is--a great deal, beginning. And beginning greatest thing all. To try brave brave. The coward tries brave man brave he made so, never try.” “How kind are, North Wind!” “I just. All kindness justice. We owe it.” “I do not quite understand that.” “Never mind; day. There hurry understanding now.” “Who blew wind made brave?” “I did.” “I did not see you.” “Therefore believe me.” “Yes, yes; course. But little breath could strong?” “That I do not know.” “But made strong?” “No: I blew it. I knew would make strong, man boat, remember. But breath power I cannot tell. It put I made. That I know. But really I must going work.” “Ah! poor ship! I wish would stop here, let poor ship go.” “That I dare do. Will stop till I come back?” “Yes. You will not long?” “Not longer I help. Trust me, shall get home morning.” In moment North Wind gone, next Diamond heard moaning church, grew grew roaring. The storm again, he knew North Wind's hair flying. The church dark. Only little light came windows, almost precious old stained glass much lovelier new. But Diamond could see beautiful were, enough light stars show colours them. He could distinguish walls, He looked up, could see gallery along he passed. He could tell far faint glimmer windows clerestory, whose sills made part it. The church grew lonely him, he began feel like child whose mother forsaken it. Only he knew left alone always forsaken. He began feel his way place, went wandering down. His little footsteps waked little answering echoes great house. It was not big mind him. It church knew he there, meant make his house. So went giving back answer every step, length Diamond thought he like say something loud, see church would answer. But he found he afraid speak. He could utter word fear loneliness. Perhaps well he not, sound spoken word would made feel place yet deserted empty. But he thought he could sing. He fond singing, home he used sing, tunes his own, nursery rhymes he knew. So he began try `Hey diddle diddle', would not do. Then he tried `Little Boy Blue', better. Neither would `Sing Song Sixpence' sing all. Then he tried `Poor old Cockytoo', he would not do. They sounded silly! he never thought silly before. So he quiet, listened echoes came dark corners answer his footsteps. At last he gave great sigh, said, “I am tired.” But he hear gentle echo answered far away his head, moment he came lowest steps stretched across church, fell hurt his arm. He cried little first, crawled steps his hands knees. At top he came little bit carpet, he lay down; he lay staring dull window rose nearly hundred feet his head. Now eastern window church, moon moment edge horizon. The next, she peeping it. And lo! moon, St. John St. Paul, rest them, began dawn window lovely garments. Diamond know wonder-working moon behind, he thought light coming window itself, good old men appearing help him, growing night darkness, he hurt his arm, tired lonely, North Wind long coming. So he lay looked backwards his head, wondering would come would next. They dim, moonlight strong enough colours, he enough his eyes trying make shapes. So his eyes grew tired, tired, his eyelids grew heavy would keep tumbling his eyes. He kept lifting lifting them, every time heavier last. It use: much him. Sometimes he got half up, again; length he gave quite, moment he gave up, he fast asleep. CHAPTER VIII. THE EAST WINDOW THAT Diamond fallen fast asleep evident strange things he fancied taking place. For he thought he heard sound whispering great window. He tried open his eyes, he could not. And whispering went grew louder louder, he could hear every word said. He thought Apostles talking him. But he could open his eyes. “And comes he lying there, St. Peter?” said one. “I think I saw ago gallery, Nicodemus window. Perhaps he fallen down. “What think, St. Matthew?” “I do not think he could crept falling height. He must killed.” “What him? We cannot leave lying there. And could make comfortable window: it is rather crowded already. What say, St. Thomas?” “Let us go look him.” There came rustling, chinking, time, silence, Diamond felt somehow Apostles standing round looking him. And still he could open his eyes. “What matter him, St. Luke?” asked one. “There is nothing matter him,” answered St. Luke, must joined company Apostles next window, one would think. “He is sound sleep.” “I it,” cried another. “This one North Wind's tricks. She caught dropped door, like withered leaf foundling baby. I do not understand woman's conduct, I must say. As had not enough money, without going taking care people's children! That is forefathers built cathedrals for.” Now Diamond could bear hear things North Wind, who, he knew, never played anybody trick. She far busy her work that. He struggled hard open his eyes, without success. “She consider church place pranks, mention live it,” said another. “It certainly disrespectful her. But she always disrespectful. What right she bang windows she whole night? I daresay glass broken somewhere. I know blue robe dreadful mess rain first dust after. It cost shillings clean it.” Then Diamond knew could Apostles, talking like this. They could sextons vergers such-like, got night, put robes deans bishops, called grand names, foolish servants he heard his father tell call lords ladies, masters mistresses. And he angry daring abuse North Wind, he jumped up, crying--“North Wind knows best she about. She good right blow cobwebs windows, she sent it. She sweeps away grander places, I tell you, I have her it.” This he began say, he spoke his eyes came wide open, behold, neither Apostles vergers there--not even window effigies holy men it, dark heap hay him, little panes roof his loft glimmering blue light morning. Old Diamond coming awake stable. In moment he his feet, shaking young Diamond's bed trembled him. “He is grand shaking himself,” said Diamond. “I wish I could shake like that. But I wash myself, he cannot. What fun would see Old Diamond washing his face his hoofs iron shoes! Would not picture?” So saying, he got dressed himself. Then he went garden. There must tremendous wind night, although quiet now, lay little summer-house crushed ground, great elm-tree, wind broken across, much decayed middle. Diamond almost cried see wilderness green leaves, used far blue air, tossing breeze, liking best wind blew most, lying near ground, without hope ever getting deep air again. “I wonder old tree is!” thought Diamond. “It must take long time get near sky poor tree was.” “Yes, indeed,” said voice beside him, Diamond spoken last words aloud. Diamond started, looking around saw clergyman, brother Mrs. Coleman, happened visiting her. He great scholar, habit rising early. “Who you, man?” he added. “Little Diamond,” answered boy. “Oh! I heard you. How come early?” “Because sham Apostles talked nonsense, waked up.” The clergyman stared. Diamond saw he better held his tongue, he could explain things. “You must dreaming, little man,” said he. “Dear! dear!” he went on, looking tree, “there terrible work here. This north wind's doing. What pity! I wish lived back it, I am sure.” “Where sir?” asked Diamond. “Away Hyperborean regions,” answered clergyman, smiling. “I never heard place,” returned Diamond. “I daresay not,” answered clergyman; “but tree now, would blown down, wind there.” “But, please, sir, there,” said Diamond, “we sorry it.” “Certainly not.” “Then should not glad it, either.” “You are quite right, boy,” said clergyman, looking kindly, he turned away house, his eyes bent towards earth. But Diamond thought within himself, “I ask North Wind next time I see her take country. I think she speak before.” CHAPTER IX. HOW DIAMOND GOT TO THE BACK OF THE NORTH WIND WHEN Diamond went home breakfast, he found his father mother already seated table. They busy bread butter, Diamond sat his usual place. His mother looked him, and, watching moment, said: “I do not think boy looking well, husband.” “Do not you? Well, I do not know. I think he looks pretty bobbish. How feel yourself, Diamond, boy?” “Quite well, thank you, father; least, I think I have got little headache.” “There! I told you,” said his father mother once. “The child's poorly” added his mother. “The child's quite well,” added his father. And laughed. “You see,” said his mother, “I have letter sister Sandwich.” “Sleepy old hole!” said his father. “Do not abuse place; there is good people it,” said his mother. “Right, old lady,” returned his father; “only I do not believe two pair carriage-horses whole blessed place.” “Well, people get heaven without carriages--or coachmen either, husband. Not I like go without coachman, know. But boy?” “What boy?” “That boy, there, staring his goggle-eyes.” “Have I got goggle-eyes, mother?” asked Diamond, little dismayed. “Not goggle,” said his mother, quite proud her boy's eyes, want make vain. “Not goggle; need stare so.” “Well, him?” said his father. “I told I got letter.” “Yes, sister; Diamond.” “La, husband! you have got bed wrong leg first morning, I believe.” “I always get once,” said his father, laughing. “Well, listen then. His aunt wants boy go see her.” “And that is want make he are not looking well.” “No he is. I think he better go.” “Well, I do not care, find money,” said his father. “I will manage that,” said his mother; agreed Diamond go Sandwich. I describe preparations Diamond made. You would thought he going three months' voyage. Nor I describe journey, business place. He met station his aunt, cheerful middle-aged woman, conveyed safety sleepy old town, his father called it. And wonder sleepy, nearly dead old age. Diamond went staring his beautiful goggle-eyes, quaint old streets, shops, houses. Everything looked strange, indeed; town abandoned nurse, sea, like old oyster left shore till gaped weariness. It used one five chief seaports England, began hold high, consequence sea grew less less intimate it, gradually drew back, kept itself, till length left high dry: Sandwich seaport more; sea went tide-business long way off, forgot it. Of course went sleep, ships. That is comes cities nations, boys girls, say, “I without help. I am enough myself.” Diamond soon made great friends old woman kept toyshop, his mother given twopence pocket-money he left, he gone her shop spend it, she got talking him. She looked funny, she got teeth, Diamond liked her, went often her shop, although he nothing spend twopence gone. One afternoon he wandering rather wearily streets time. It hot day, he felt tired. As he passed toyshop, he stepped in. “Please may I sit minute box?” he said, thinking old woman somewhere shop. But he got answer, sat without one. Around great many toys prices, penny shillings. All he heard gentle whirring somewhere amongst them. It made start look behind him. There sails windmill going round round almost close his ear. He thought first must one toys wound go clockwork; no, common penny toy, windmill end whistle, whistle blows windmill goes. But wonder one whistle end blowing, yet sails turning round round--now faster, slower, faster again. “What mean?” said Diamond, aloud. “It means me,” said tiniest voice he ever heard. “Who you, please?” asked Diamond. “Well, really, I begin ashamed you,” said voice. “I wonder long know me; often I might take got sharp enough suspect me. You bad baby does not know his mother new bonnet.” “Not quite bad that, dear North Wind,” said Diamond, “for I did not see all, indeed I do not see yet, although I recognise voice. Do grow little, please.” “Not hair's-breadth,” said voice, smallest voice ever spoke. “What here?” “I come see aunt. But, please, North Wind, did not come back church night?” “I did. I carried safe home. All time dreaming glass Apostles, lying arms.” “I am glad,” said Diamond. “I thought must it, I wanted hear say so. Did sink ship, then?” “Yes.” “And drown everybody?” “Not quite. One boat got away six seven men it.” “How could boat swim ship could not?” “Of course I trouble it. I contrive bit, manage waves little. When they are thoroughly waked up, I good deal trouble sometimes. They are apt get stupid tumbling other's heads. That is they are fairly it. However, boat got desert island noon next day.” “And good come that?” “I do not know. I obeyed orders. Good bye.” “Oh! stay, North Wind, stay!” cried Diamond, dismayed see windmill get slower slower. “What it, dear child?” said North Wind, windmill began turning swiftly Diamond could scarcely see it. “What big voice you have got! noise make it? What want? I little do, little must done.” “I want take country back north wind.” “That is easy,” said North Wind, silent long Diamond thought she gone indeed. But he quite given her up, voice began again. “I almost wish old Herodotus held his tongue it. Much he knew it!” “Why wish that, North Wind?” “Because clergyman would never heard it, set wanting go. But shall see. We shall see. You must go home now, dear, do not seem well, I will see done you. Do not wait me. I have got break old Goody's toys; she is thinking much her new stock. Two three do. There! go now.” Diamond rose, quite sorry, without word left shop, went home. It soon appeared his mother right him, afternoon his head began ache much, he go bed. He awoke middle night. The lattice window his room blown open, curtains his little bed swinging wind. “If North Wind now!” thought Diamond. But next moment he heard one closing window, his aunt came his bedside. She put her hand his face, said-- “How is head, dear?” “Better, auntie, I think.” “Would like something drink?” “Oh, yes! I should, please.” So his aunt gave lemonade, she used nursing sick people, Diamond felt much refreshed, laid his head go fast asleep, he thought. And he did, come awake again, fresh burst wind blew lattice open second time. The moment he found cloud North Wind's hair, her beautiful face, set like moon, bending him. “Quick, Diamond!” she said. “I found chance!” “But I am well,” said Diamond. “I know that, better little fresh air. You shall plenty that.” “You want go, then?” “Yes, I do. It will not hurt you.” “Very well,” said Diamond; getting bed-clothes, he jumped North Wind's arms. “We must make haste aunt comes,” said she, she glided open lattice left swinging. The moment Diamond felt her arms fold around he began feel better. It moonless night, dark, glimpses stars clouds parted. “I used dash waves here,” said North Wind, “where cows sheep feeding now; shall soon get them. There are.” And Diamond, looking down, saw white glimmer breaking water far him. “You see, Diamond,” said North Wind, “it difficult get back north wind, country lies north itself, course I cannot blow northwards.” “Why not?” asked Diamond. “You little silly!” said North Wind. “Do not see I blow northwards I South Wind, much say one person could two persons?” “But ever get home all, then?” “You quite right--that home, though I never get farther outer door. I sit doorstep, hear voices inside. I nobody there, Diamond.” “I am sorry.” “Why?” “That nobody.” “Oh, I do not mind it. Dear little man! glad day nobody yourself. But cannot understand now, better try; do, certain go fancying egregious nonsense, making miserable it.” “Then I will not,” said Diamond. “There is good boy. It come good time.” “But have not told get doorstep, know.” “It easy enough me. I consent nobody, I am. I draw I doorstep. But easily see, less sense I think, drag you, heavy thing, along me, would take centuries, I could give time it.” “Oh, I am sorry!” said Diamond. “What now, pet?” “That I am heavy you. I would lighter I could, I do not know how.” “You silly darling! Why, I could toss hundred miles I liked. It I going home I shall find heavy.” “Then going home me?” “Of course. Did I come fetch that?” “But time must going southwards.” “Yes. Of course I am.” “How taking northwards, then?” “A sensible question. But shall see. I get rid clouds--only come fast! It is like trying blow brook dry. There! What see now?” “I think I see little boat, away there, below.” “A little boat, indeed! Well! She is yacht two hundred tons; captain friend mine; he man good sense, sail his craft well. I have helped many time he little thought it. I have heard grumbling me, I best I could him. Why, I have carried eighty miles day, again, right north.” “He must dodged that,” said Diamond, watching vessels, seen went ways wind blew. “Of course he must. But do not see, best I could do? I could not South Wind. And besides gave share business. It good all--mind that, Diamond--to everything love, give share doing. It is kind. It is making much yourself, child. If I South Wind, he would smoked his pipe day, made stupid.” “But could he man sense grumble best him?” “Oh! must make allowances,” said North Wind, “or never justice anybody.--You understand, then, captain may sail north----” “In spite north wind--yes,” supplemented Diamond. “Now, I think must stupid, dear” said North Wind. “Suppose north wind blow would he then?” “Why south wind would carry him.” “So think north wind stops south wind blows. Nonsense. If I did not blow, captain could not sail his eighty miles day. No doubt South Wind would carry faster, South Wind sitting her doorstep then, I stopped would dead calm. So wrong say he sail north spite me; he sails north help, help alone. You see that, Diamond?” “Yes, I do, North Wind. I stupid, I do not want stupid.” “Good boy! I going blow north little craft, one finest ever sailed sea. Here are, right it. I shall blowing you; sailing me; want it. The captain will not get fast he would like, he get on, shall we. I am going put board. Do see front tiller--that thing man working, one side, other--a round thing like top drum?” “Yes,” said Diamond. “Below keep spare sails, stores sort. I going blow cover off. The moment I drop deck, must tumble in. Do not afraid, depth, fall sail-cloth. You find nice warm dry-only dark; know I near every roll pitch vessel. Coil go sleep. The yacht shall cradle shall baby.” “Thank you, dear North Wind. I bit afraid,” said Diamond. In moment level bulwarks, North Wind sent hatch after-store rattling away deck leeward. The next, Diamond found dark, he tumbled hole North Wind told him, cover replaced his head. Away he went rolling leeward, wind began blow hard. He heard call captain, loud trampling men his head, hauled main sheet get boom board might take reef mainsail. Diamond felt he found seemed comfortable place, he snuggled lay. Hours hours, great many them, went by; still Diamond lay there. He never felt least tired impatient, strange pleasure filled his heart. The straining masts, creaking boom, singing ropes, banging blocks put vessel about, fell roaring wind above, surge waves past her sides, thud every one would strike her; Diamond could hear gurgling, rippling, talking flow water her planks, she slipped it, lying side, that--like subdued air running grand music his North Wind making keep tiring sped towards country back her doorstep. How long lasted Diamond idea. He seemed fall asleep sometimes, sleep he heard sounds going on. At length weather seemed get worse. The confusion trampling feet grew frequent his head; vessel lay her side, went roaring waves, banged thumped her anger. All arose terrible uproar. The hatch blown off; cold fierce wind swept upon him; long arm came laid hold lifted out. The moment he saw little vessel far righting herself. She taken her sails lay tossing waves like sea-bird folded wings. A short distance south lay much larger vessel, two three sails set, towards North Wind carrying Diamond. It German ship, way North Pole. “That vessel give us lift now,” said North Wind; “and I must best I can.” She managed hide amongst flags big ship, snugly stowed away, sped towards north. At length one night she whispered his ear, “Come deck, Diamond;” he got crept deck. Everything looked strange. Here sides huge masses floating ice, looking like cathedrals, castles, crags, away beyond blue sea. “Is sun rising setting?” asked Diamond. “Neither both, please. I hardly tell myself. If he setting now, he rising next moment.” “What strange light is!” said Diamond. “I heard sun does not go bed summer parts. Miss Coleman told that. I suppose he feels sleepy, light he sends looks like dream.” “That account well enough practical purposes,” said North Wind. Some icebergs drifting northwards; one passing near ship. North Wind seized Diamond, single bound lighted one them--a huge thing, sharp pinnacles great clefts. The instant wind began blow south. North Wind hurried Diamond north side iceberg, stepping jags splintering; berg never got far enough south melted smoothed summer sun. She brought cave near water, she entered, and, letting Diamond go, sat weary ledge ice. Diamond seated side, enraptured colour air inside cave. It deep, dazzling, lovely blue, deeper deepest blue sky. The blue seemed constant motion, like blackness press eyeballs fingers, boiling sparkling. But he looked across North Wind he frightened; her face worn livid. “What matter you, dear North Wind?” he said. “Nothing much. I feel faint. But must not mind it, I bear quite well. South Wind always blows faint. If cool thick ice her, I faint altogether. Indeed, is, I fear I must vanish.” Diamond stared her terror, he saw her form face growing, small, transparent, like something dissolving, water, light. He could see side blue cave her heart. And she melted away till left pale face, like moon morning, two great lucid eyes it. “I going, Diamond,” she said. “Does hurt you?” asked Diamond. “It is uncomfortable,” she answered; “but I do not mind it, I shall come right long. I thought I able go way, I cannot. You must frightened though. Just go straight on, come right. You will find doorstep.” As she spoke, her face faded quite away, Diamond thought he could still see her eyes shining blue. When he went closer, however, he found he thought her eyes two hollows ice. North Wind quite gone; Diamond would cried, he trusted her thoroughly. So he sat still blue air cavern listening wash ripple water base iceberg, sped open sea northwards. It excellent craft go current, twice much water above. But light south wind blowing too, went fast. After little Diamond went sat edge his floating island, looked ocean beneath him. The white sides berg reflected much light water, he could see far green abyss. Sometimes he fancied he saw eyes North Wind looking below, fancy never lasted beyond moment birth. And time passed he know how, he felt he dream. When he got tired green water, he went blue cave; he got tired blue cave he went gazed blue sea, ever sparkling sun, kept wheeling sky, never going horizon. But he chiefly gazed northwards, see whether land appearing. All time he never wanted eat. He broke little bits berg sucked them, he thought nice. At length, one time he came his cave, he spied far horizon, shining peak rose sky like top tremendous iceberg; his vessel bearing straight towards it. As went peak rose rose higher higher horizon; peaks rose it, sharp edges jagged ridges connecting them. Diamond thought must place he going to; he right; mountains rose rose, till he saw line coast feet length iceberg drove little bay, around lofty precipices snow tops, streaks ice sides. The berg floated slowly projecting rock. Diamond stepped shore, without looking behind began follow natural path led windingly towards top precipice. When he reached it, he found broad table ice, along he could walk without much difficulty. Before him, considerable distance, rose lofty ridge ice, shot fantastic pinnacles towers battlements. The air cold, seemed somehow dead, slightest breath wind. In centre ridge appeared gap like opening valley. But he walked towards it, gazing, wondering whether could way he take, he saw appeared gap form woman seated ice front ridge, leaning forwards her hands her lap, her hair hanging ground. “It North Wind her doorstep,” said Diamond joyfully, hurried on. He soon came place, form sat, like one great figures door Egyptian temple, motionless, drooping arms head. Then Diamond grew frightened, she move speak. He sure North Wind, he thought she must dead last. Her face white snow, her eyes blue air ice-cave, her hair hung straight, like icicles. She greenish robe, like colour hollows glacier seen far off. He stood her, gazed fearfully her face minutes he ventured speak. At length, great effort trembling voice, he faltered out-- “North Wind!” “Well, child?” said form, without lifting head. “Are ill, dear North Wind?” “No. I waiting.” “What for?” “Till I am wanted.” “You do not care more,” said Diamond, almost crying now. “Yes I do. Only I cannot show it. All love bottom heart. But I feel bubbling there.” “What want next, dear North Wind?” said Diamond, wishing show his love obedient. “What want yourself?” “I want go country back.” “Then must go me.” “I do not know mean.” “I mean I say. You must walk I open door, go right me.” “But hurt you.” “Not least. It hurt you, though.” “I do not mind that, tell it.” “Do it,” said North Wind. Diamond walked towards her instantly. When he reached her knees, he put his hand lay her, nothing save intense cold. He walked on. Then grew white him; cold stung like fire. He walked still, groping whiteness. It thickened him. At last, got his heart, he lost sense. I would say he fainted--only whereas common faints grows black you, he felt swallowed whiteness. It he reached North Wind's heart he fainted fell. But he fell, he rolled threshold, thus Diamond got back north wind. CHAPTER X. AT THE BACK OF THE NORTH WIND I HAVE come difficult part story. And why? Because I know enough it. And I know much part part? For course I could know nothing story except Diamond told it; Diamond tell country back north wind, well his adventures getting there? Because, he came back, he forgotten great deal, he remember hard tell. Things different things here! The people speak language one thing. Indeed, Diamond insisted speak all. I think he right, may well appeared Diamond. The fact is, different reports place trustworthy people. Therefore bound believe appears somewhat different different people. All, however, agree general way it. I tell something two different people reported, knew it, I believe, Herodotus. One speaks his experience, he visited country; testimony young peasant girl came back month's visit her friends. The former great Italian noble family, died five hundred years ago; latter Scotch shepherd died forty years ago. The Italian, then, informs us he enter country fire hot he would thrown boiling glass cool himself. This Diamond's experience, Durante--that name Italian, means Lasting, his books last long enough men world worthy them--Durante elderly man, Diamond little boy, experience must little different. The peasant girl, hand, fell fast asleep wood, woke country. In describing it, Durante says ground everywhere smelt sweetly, gentle, even-tempered wind, never blew faster slower, breathed his face he went, making leaves point one way, disturb birds tops trees, but, contrary, sounding bass song. He describes also little river full little waves, hurried along, bent grass, full red yellow flowers, flowed. He says purest stream world beside one would look mixed something belong it, even although flowing ever brown shadow trees, neither sun moon could shine upon it. He seems imply always month May country. It would place describe wonderful sights he saw, music another key story, I shall therefore add account traveller, people free healthy, every one crown like king mitre like priest. The peasant girl--Kilmeny her name--could report grand things Durante, for, shepherd says, telling her story I tell Diamond's-- “Kilmeny she knew where, And Kilmeny seen she could declare; Kilmeny cock never crew, Where rain never fell, wind never blew. But seemed harp sky rung, And airs heaven played round her tongue, When she spoke lovely forms she seen, And land sin never been; A land love land light, Withouten sun, moon, night; Where river swayed living stream, And light pure cloudless beam: The land vision would seem, And still everlasting dream.” The last two lines shepherd's remark, matter opinion. But clear, I think, Kilmeny must described country Durante saw, though, his experience, she could neither understand describe well. Now I must give fragments recollection Diamond able bring back him. When he came he fell, he found back north wind. North Wind herself nowhere seen. Neither vestige snow ice within sight. The sun vanished; matter, plenty certain still rayless light. Where came he never found out; he thought belonged country itself. Sometimes he thought came flowers, bright, strong colour. He said river--for agree river there--flowed through, grass: channel, instead rock, stones, pebbles, sand, anything else, pure meadow grass, long. He insisted sing tunes people's ears, sung tunes heads, proof I may mention that, troubles followed, Diamond often heard singing; asked he singing, would answer, “One tunes river back north wind sung.” And I may well say Diamond never told things one but--no, I better say was; whoever told me, I thought would well write child-readers. He could say he happy there, he neither his father mother him, he felt still quiet patient contented, that, far mere feeling went, something better mere happiness. Nothing went wrong back north wind. Neither anything quite right, he thought. Only everything going right day. His account disagreed Durante, agreed Kilmeny, this, he protested wind all. I fancy he missed it. At events could without wind. It depends big lungs whether wind strong us not. When person he told asked whether he saw anybody he knew there, he answered, “Only little girl belonging gardener, thought he lost her, quite mistaken, she safe enough, come back day, I came back, would wait.” “Did talk her, Diamond?” “No. Nobody talks there. They look other, understand everything.” “Is cold there?” “No.” “Is hot?” “No.” “What then?” “You never think things there.” “What queer place must be!” “It is good place.” “Do want go back again?” “No; I do not think I left it; I feel here, somewhere.” “Did people look pleased?” “Yes--quite pleased, little sad.” “Then did not look glad?” “They looked waiting gladder day.” This Diamond used answer questions country. And I take story again, tell he got back country. CHAPTER XI. HOW DIAMOND GOT HOME AGAIN WHEN one back north wind wanted know things going one he loved, he go certain tree, climb stem, sit branches. In minutes, he kept still, he would see something least going people he loved. One day Diamond sitting tree, he began long much get home again, wonder, he saw his mother crying. Durante says people may always follow wishes, never wish good. Diamond's wish get home, he would fain follow his wish. But he set it? If he could see North Wind! But moment he got her back, she gone altogether his sight. He never seen her back. She might sitting her doorstep still, looking southwards, waiting, white thin blue-eyed, she wanted. Or she might become mighty creature, power demanded her, gone far away upon many missions. She must somewhere, however. He could go home without her, therefore he must find her. She could never intended leave always away his mother. If danger that, she would told him, given his choice going. For North Wind right honest. How find North Wind, therefore, occupied his thoughts. In his anxiety his mother, he used climb tree every day, sit branches. However many dwellers so, never incommoded one another; moment one got tree, he became invisible every one else; wide-spreading tree room every one people country it, without least interference other. Sometimes, getting down, two would meet root, would smile sweetly time, much say, “Ah, you have too!” One day he sitting one outer branches tree, looking southwards his home. Far away blue shining sea, dotted gleaming sparkling specks white. Those icebergs. Nearer he saw great range snow-capped mountains, lovely meadow-grass country, stream flowing flowing it, away towards sea. As he looked he began wonder, whole country lay beneath like map, near looked small he knew miles away. The ridge ice encircled appeared yards off, larger row pebbles child mark boundaries kingdom he appropriated sea-shore. He thought he could distinguish vapoury form North Wind, seated he left her, side. Hastily he descended tree, his amazement found map model country still lay his feet. He stood it. With one stride he crossed river; another he reached ridge ice; third he stepped peaks, sank wearily North Wind's knees. For she sat her doorstep. The peaks great ridge ice lofty ever behind her, country her back vanished Diamond's view. North Wind still Diamond left her. Her pale face white snow, her motionless eyes blue caverns ice. But instant Diamond touched her, her face began change like one waking sleep. Light began glimmer blue her eyes. A moment more, she laid her hand Diamond's head, began playing his hair. Diamond took hold her hand, laid his face it. She gave little start. “How alive are, child!” she murmured. “Come nearer me.” By help stones around he clambered beside her, laid her bosom. She gave great sigh, slowly lifted her arms, slowly folded him, she clasped close. Yet moment, she roused herself, came quite awake; cold her bosom, pierced Diamond's bones, vanished. “Have sitting ever since I went you, dear North Wind?” asked Diamond, stroking her hand. “Yes,” she answered, looking her old kindness. “Are not tired?” “No; I have often sit longer. Do know long been?” “Oh! years years,” answered Diamond. “You seven days,” returned North Wind. “I thought I hundred years!” exclaimed Diamond. “Yes, I daresay,” replied North Wind. “You have away seven days; long may quite another thing. Behind back face things different! They do not go rule.” “I am glad,” said Diamond, thinking while. “Why?” asked North Wind. “Because I have long time there, little away mother. Why, she will not expecting home Sandwich yet!” “No. But must not talk longer. I have got orders now, must minutes.” Next moment Diamond found sitting alone rock. North Wind vanished. A creature like great humble-bee cockchafer flew past his face; could neither, insects amongst ice. It passed again, flying circles around him, he concluded must North Wind herself, bigger Tom Thumb his mother put nutshell lined flannel. But she longer vapoury thin. She solid, although tiny. A moment more, she perched his shoulder. “Come along, Diamond,” she said his ear, smallest highest treble voices; “it time setting Sandwich.” Diamond could see her, turning his head towards his shoulder far he could, one eye, his nose came her other. “Will not take arms carry me?” he said whisper, he knew she like loud voice she small. “Ah! ungrateful boy,” returned North Wind, smiling “how dare make game me? Yes, I carry you, shall walk bit impertinence first. Come along.” She jumped his shoulder, Diamond looked her upon ground, he could see nothing little spider long legs made way ice towards south. It ran fast indeed spider, Diamond ran long way it, waited it. It sooner he expected, however, grown good deal. And spider grew grew went faster faster, till Diamond discovered spider, weasel; away glided weasel, away went Diamond it, took run keep weasel. And weasel grew, grew, grew, till Diamond saw weasel weasel cat. And away went cat, Diamond it. And he run half mile, he found cat waiting him, sitting washing her face lose time. And away went cat again, Diamond it. But next time he came cat, cat cat, hunting-leopard. And hunting-leopard grew jaguar, covered spots like eyes. And jaguar grew Bengal tiger. And none Diamond afraid, he North Wind's back, he could afraid her longer whatever she grew. And tiger flew snow straight line south, growing less less Diamond's eyes till black speck upon whiteness; vanished altogether. And Diamond felt he would rather run farther, ice got rough. Besides, he near precipices bounded sea, he slackened his pace walk, saying aloud himself: “When North Wind punished enough making game her, she come back me; I know she will, I cannot go much farther without her.” “You dear boy! It fun. Here I am!” said North Wind's voice behind him. Diamond turned, saw her he liked best see her, standing beside him, tall lady. “Where is tiger?” he asked, he knew creatures picture book Miss Coleman given him. “But, course,” he added, “you tiger. I puzzled forgot. I saw long way me, behind me. It is odd, know.” “It must look odd you, Diamond: I see that. But odd break old pine two.” “Well, that is odd enough,” remarked Diamond. “So is! I forgot. Well, none things odder eat bread butter.” “Well, that is odd too, I think it,” persisted Diamond. “I like slice bread butter! I am afraid say long is--how long seems me, is--since I anything eat.” “Come then,” said North Wind, stooping holding her arms. “You shall bread butter soon. I glad find want some.” Diamond held his arms meet hers, safe upon her bosom. North Wind bounded air. Her tresses began lift rise spread stream flow flutter; roar her hair answering roar one great glaciers beside them, whose slow torrent tumbled two three icebergs waves feet, North Wind Diamond went flying southwards. CHAPTER XII. WHO MET DIAMOND AT SANDWICH As THEY flew, fast went sea slid away like great web shot silk, blue shot grey, green shot purple. They went fast stars appeared sail away past overhead, “like golden boats,” blue sea turned upside down. And went fast Diamond went way fast--I mean he went fast asleep North Wind's arms. When he woke, face bending him; North Wind's; his mother's. He put his arms her, she clasped her bosom burst crying. Diamond kissed her make her stop. Perhaps kissing best thing crying, always stop it. “What matter, mother?” he said. “Oh, Diamond, darling! ill!” she sobbed. “No, mother dear. I have back north wind,” returned Diamond. “I thought dead,” said his mother. But moment doctor came in. “Oh! there!” said doctor gentle cheerfulness; “we are better to-day, I see.” Then he drew mother aside, told her talk Diamond, mind he might say; he must kept quiet possible. And indeed Diamond much inclined talk, he felt strange weak, little wonder, seeing time he away he sucked lumps ice, could much nourishment them. Now he lying there, getting strong chicken broth nice things, I tell readers taking place his home, ought told it. They may forgotten Miss Coleman poor state health. Now three reasons this. In first place, her lungs strong. In second place, gentleman somewhere behaved well her. In third place, she anything particular do. These three nots together enough make lady ill indeed. Of course she could help first because; two causes existed, would little consequence; she would little careful. The second she could help quite; she anything do, done well, would difficult man behave badly her. And third her illness, she anything worth doing, she might borne his bad behaviour even would made her ill. It always easy, I confess, find something worth doing, difficult things constantly done, she might found something she tried. Her fault lay this, she tried. But, sure, her father mother blame never set her going. Only again, nobody told her father mother ought set her going direction. So none would find themselves, North Wind teach them. We know North Wind busy night she left Diamond cathedral. She sense blowing Colemans' house whole night. First, Miss Coleman's maid left chink her mistress's window open, thinking she shut it, North Wind wound her hairs round lady's throat. She considerably worse next morning. Again, ship North Wind sunk night belonged Mr. Coleman. Nor readers understand heavy loss I informed he getting poorer poorer time. He successful his speculations he been, he speculated great deal right, time he pulled up. It hard thing rich man grow poor; awful thing grow dishonest, kinds speculation lead man deep dishonesty he thinks he about. Poverty make man worthless--he may worth great deal he poor he he rich; dishonesty goes far indeed make man value--a thing thrown dust-hole creation, like bit broken basin, dirty rag. So North Wind look Mr. Coleman, try make honest man him. So she sank ship his last venture, he his wife world called ruined. Nor yet. For board vessel Miss Coleman's lover passenger; news came vessel gone down, board perished, may sure she think loss fine house garden furniture greatest misfortune world. Of course, trouble end Mr. Coleman his family. Nobody suffer alone. When suffering deeply hidden heart, nobody knows anything man himself, he must great good man indeed, us known, pain inside make behave less uncomfortable. But man brings money-troubles making haste rich, people he must suffer way himself. The elm-tree North Wind blew night, small great trials gathered one heap, crushed Miss Coleman's pretty summer-house: fall Mr. Coleman crushed little family lived his coach-house stable. Before Diamond well enough taken home, home go to. Mr. Coleman--or his creditors, I know particulars--had sold house, carriage, horses, furniture, everything. He his wife daughter Mrs. Crump gone live small house Hoxton, he would unknown, whence he could walk his place business City. For he old man, hoped yet retrieve his fortunes. Let us hope he lived retrieve his honesty, tail slipped his fingers last joint, beyond it. Of course, Diamond's father nothing time, hard nothing Miss Coleman. He wrote his wife that, her sister would keep her till he got place, would better them, he would greatly obliged her. Meantime, gentleman bought house allowed his furniture remain little while. Diamond's aunt quite willing keep long she could. And indeed Diamond yet well enough moved safety. When he recovered far able go out, one day his mother got her sister's husband, little pony-cart, carry sea-shore, leave hours. He business Ramsgate, would pick he returned. A whiff sea-air would good, she said, she thought besides she could best tell Diamond happened she quite herself. CHAPTER XIII. THE SEASIDE DIAMOND his mother sat upon edge rough grass bordered sand. The sun far enough past highest shine eyes looked eastward. A sweet little wind blew left side, comforted mother without letting her know comforted her. Away stretched sparkling waters ocean, every wave flashed delight back face great sun, looked stillness blue house glorious silent face upon flashing children. On hand shore rounded outwards, forming little bay. There white cliffs here, north south, place rather dreary, sky got much better. Not house, creature within sight. Dry sand feet, thin wiry grass, managed grow poverty-stricken shore. “Oh dear!” said Diamond's mother, deep sigh, “it is sad world!” “Is it?” said Diamond. “I did not know.” “How know, child? You have well taken care of, I trust.” “Oh yes, I have,” returned Diamond. “I am sorry! I thought taken care too. I thought father took care you. I ask it. I think he must forgotten.” “Dear boy!” said his mother, “your father's best man world.” “So I thought!” returned Diamond triumph. “I sure it!--Well, does not he take good care you?” “Yes, yes, he does,” answered his mother, bursting tears. “But who is take care him? And he take care us he is got nothing eat himself?” “Oh dear!” said Diamond gasp; “has not he got anything eat? Oh! I must go home him.” “No, no, child. He is come yet. But what is become us, I do not know.” “Are hungry, mother? There is basket. I thought put something eat it.” “O darling stupid! I did not say I hungry,” returned his mother, smiling her tears. “Then I do not understand all,” said Diamond. “Do tell what is matter.” “There people world nothing eat, Diamond.” “Then I suppose do not stop longer. They--they--what call--die--do not they?” “Yes, do. How would like that?” “I do not know. I never tried. But I suppose go get something eat.” “Like enough do not want it,” said his mother, petulantly. “That is right then,” said Diamond, thinking I daresay he chose put words. “Is though? Poor boy! little know things! Mr. Coleman's lost his money, father nothing do, shall nothing eat by.” “Are sure, mother?” “Sure what?” “Sure shall nothing eat.” “No, thank Heaven! I am sure it. I hope not.” “Then I cannot understand it, mother. There is piece gingerbread basket, I know.” “O little bird! You sense sparrow picks wants, never thinks winter frost and, snow.” “Ah--yes--I see. But birds get winter, do not they?” “Some fall dead ground.” “They must die time. They would not like birds always. Would you, mother?” “What child is!” thought his mother, she said nothing. “Oh! I remember,” Diamond went on. “Father told day I went Epping Forest him, rose-bushes, may-bushes, holly-bushes bird's barns, hips, haws, holly-berries, ready winter.” “Yes; that is true. So see birds provided for. But barns me, Diamond.” “Are not there?” “No. We have got work bread.” “Then let us go work,” said Diamond, getting up. “It is use. We have got anything do.” “Then let us wait.” “Then shall starve.” “No. There is basket. Do know, mother, I think I shall call basket barn.” “It is big one. And it is empty--where then?” “At auntie's cupboard,” returned Diamond promptly. “But cannot eat auntie's things leave her starve.” “No, no. We will go back father that. He will found cupboard somewhere time.” “How know that?” “I do not know it. But I have not got even cupboard, I have always plenty eat. I have heard say I much, sometimes.” “But I tell that is I have cupboard you, child.” “And empty, auntie opened hers.” “But cannot go on.” “How know? I think must big cupboard somewhere, little cupboards filled, know, mother.” “Well, I wish I could find door cupboard,” said his mother. But moment she stopped, silent good while. I cannot tell whether Diamond knew she thinking, I think I know. She heard something church day before, came back upon her--something like this, she had not eat tomorrow well to-day; wanted could not missed. So, instead saying anything more, she stretched her hand basket, she Diamond dinner. And Diamond enjoy it. For drive fresh air made quite hungry; he not, like his mother, trouble dine day week. The fact he lived long without food back north wind, he knew quite well food essential existence; fact, certain circumstances, people could live without well enough. His mother speak much dinner. After she helped walk little, he able much soon got tired. He get fretful, though. He glad sun wind again, fret he could run about. He lay dry sand, his mother covered shawl. She sat his side, took bit work her pocket. But Diamond felt rather sleepy, turned his side gazed sleepily sand. A yards he saw something fluttering. “What that, mother?” he said. “Only bit paper,” she answered. “It flutters bit paper would, I think,” said Diamond. “I will go see like,” said his mother. “My eyes none best.” So she rose went found right, little book, partly buried sand. But several leaves clear sand, wind kept blowing flutterful manner. She took brought Diamond. “What it, mother?” he asked. “Some nursery rhymes, I think,” she answered. “I am sleepy,” said Diamond. “Do read me.” “Yes, I will,” she said, began one.--“But nonsense!” she said again. “I try find better one.” She turned leaves searching, three times, sudden puffs, wind blew leaves rustling back verses. “Do read one,” said Diamond, seemed mind wind. “It sounded nice. I sure good one.” So his mother thought might amuse him, though she could not find sense it. She never thought he might understand it, although she could not. Now I exactly know mother read, Diamond heard, thought afterwards he heard. He was, however, I said, sleepy. And he thought he understood verses he may dreaming better ones. This went-- I know river whose waters run asleep run run ever singing shallows dumb hollows sleeping deep swallows dip feathers hollows shallows merriest swallows nests bake clay cake water shake wings rake water shallows hollows hold together weather swallows merriest fellows merriest children built narrow like head arrow cut air go nicest water flowing nicest dust blowing narrow like head arrow barrow carry mud he makes nicest water flowing nicest dust blowing build his nest her he loves best nicest cakes sunshine bakes merry children callow beaks follow gaping hollow wider wider father mother food-provider brings spider worm poor hider earth there is dearth beaks yellow buttercups growing beside flowing singing river always ever growing blowing fast sheep awake asleep crop crop cannot stop creep go blowing daisies little white praises grow blow spread crown praise sun he goes praising done fold crown sleep every one till plain he is shining amain they are praising praising low songs raising one hears sun rears sheep bite quietest sheep awake asleep merriest bleat little lambs merriest lambs forget eat frolic feet lambs dams whitest sheep woolliest wool longest wool trailingest tails shine like snow grasses grow singing river sings ever sheep lambs merry ever river sings drink lambs dams quiet white diet bite buttercups yellow daisies white grass green river make wind mellow kiss shake never seen hollows beside river swallows merriest fellows nests make clay cake sunshine bake till like bone dry wind marble stone firm bind grass clay dries wind sweetest wind blows river flowing ever never find whence comes wind blows hollows shallows dip swallows alive blows life goes awake asleep river sings flows life blows sheep awake asleep woolliest wool trailingest tails never fails gentle cool wave wool toss grass lambs sheep pass tug bite teeth white sweep trailing tails smooth grows amain amain grows wind blows tosses swallows hollows shallows till every feather doth shake quiver feathers go together blowing life joy rife swallows skim shallows yellowest children wind blows life river flowing ever washes grasses still passes feeds daisies little white praises buttercups bonny golden sunny butter honey whiten sheep awake asleep nibble bite grow whiter white merry quiet sweet diet fed river tossed ever wind tosses swallow crosses shallows dipping his wings gather water bake cake wind shall make hard bone dry stone it is wind blows behind river flows ever grasses white daisies merry sheep awake asleep happy swallows skimming shallows it is wind blows behind. Here Diamond became aware his mother stopped reading. “Why do not go on, mother dear?” he asked. “It is nonsense!” said his mother. “I believe would go ever.” “That is did,” said Diamond. “What did?” she asked. “Why, river. That is almost tune used sing.” His mother frightened, she thought fever coming again. So she contradict him. “Who made poem?” asked Diamond. “I do not know,” she answered. “Some silly woman her children, I suppose--and thought good enough print.” “She must back north wind time other, anyhow,” said Diamond. “She could not got hold anywhere else. That is went.” And he began chant bits there; his mother said nothing fear making him, worse; she glad indeed she saw her brother-in-law jogging along his little cart. They lifted Diamond in, got themselves, away went, “home again, home again, home again,” Diamond sang. But he soon grew quiet, reached Sandwich he fast asleep dreaming country back north wind. CHAPTER XIV. OLD DIAMOND AFTER Diamond recovered fast, days he quite able go home soon his father place go. Now his father saved little money, finding situation offered itself, thinking new plan. A strange occurrence turned his thoughts direction. He friend Bloomsbury region, lived letting cabs horses cabmen. This man, happening meet one day he returning unsuccessful application, said him: “Why do not set now--in cab line, I mean?” “I have not enough that,” answered Diamond's father. “You must saved goodish bit, I think. Just come home look horse I let cheap. I bought weeks ago, thinking he would Hansom, I wrong. He is got bone enough waggon, waggon are not Hansom. He are not got go enough Hansom. You see parties takes Hansoms wants go like wind, he are not got wind enough, he are not young he was. But four-wheeler takes families luggages, he is horse. He would carry small house day. I bought cheap, I will sell cheap.” “Oh, I do not want him,” said Diamond's father. “A body must time think affair much importance. And there is cab too. That would come deal money.” “I could fit there, I daresay,” said his friend. “But come look animal, anyhow.” “Since I lost old pair, Mr. Coleman's,” said Diamond's father, turning accompany cab-master, “I are not almost got heart look horse face. It is thousand pities part man horse.” “So is,” returned his friend sympathetically. But ex-coachman's delight, when, going stable his friend led him, he found horse he wanted buy his old Diamond, grown thin bony long-legged, they, could fit Hansom work! “He are not Hansom horse,” said Diamond's father indignantly. “Well, you are right. He are not handsome, he is good un” said his owner. “Who says he are not handsome? He is one handsomest horses gentleman's coachman ever druv,” said Diamond's father; remarking his breath--“though I says should not”--for he feel inclined confess his old horse could sunk low. “Well,” said his friend, “all I say is--There is animal you, strong church; an'll go like train, leastways parly,” he added, correcting himself. But coachman lump his throat tears his eyes. For old horse, hearing his voice, turned his long neck, his old friend went laid his hand his side, he whinnied joy, laid his big head his master's breast. This settled matter. The coachman's arms round horse's neck moment, he fairly broke cried. The cab-master never fond horse hug like that, he saw moment was. And he must good-hearted fellow, I never heard idea coming head man horse sell: instead putting something price he pretty sure selling him, he actually took pound he meant ask him, saying shame part old friends. Diamond's father, soon he came himself, turned asked much he wanted horse. “I see you are old friends,” said owner. “It is old Diamond. I liked far best pair, though good. You are not got too, you?” “No; nothing stable match there.” “I believe you,” said coachman. “But you will wanting long price him, I know.” “No, much. I bought cheap, I say, he are not work.” The end Diamond's father bought old Diamond again, along four-wheeled cab. And rooms stable, he took them, wrote his wife come home, set cabman. CHAPTER XV. THE MEWS IT WAS late afternoon Diamond his mother baby reached London. I full Diamond I forgot tell baby arrived meantime. His father waiting his cab, told Diamond horse was; his father wanted enjoy pleasure his surprise he found out. He got his mother without looking horse, his father put Diamond's carpet-bag his mother's little trunk, got upon box drove off; Diamond quite proud riding home his father's carriage. But he got mews, he could help little dismayed first; he never back north wind, I afraid he would cried little. But instead that, he said fine thing old furniture there. And instead helping his mother miserable change, he began find advantages place; every place advantages, always better worth knowing disadvantages. Certainly weather depressing, thick, dull, persistent rain falling time reached home. But happily weather changeable; besides, good fire burning room, neighbour drunken husband attended them; tea-things put out, kettle boiling fire. And good fire, tea bread butter, things cannot said miserable. Diamond's father mother were, notwithstanding, rather miserable, Diamond began feel kind darkness beginning spread his mind. But moment he said himself, “This never do. I cannot give this. I have back north wind. Things go right there, I must try get things go right here. I have got fight miserable things. They shall not make miserable I help it.” I mean he thought words. They perhaps grown-up thought, represent kind thing his heart his head. And heart head go together, nothing stand them. “What nice bread butter is!” said Diamond. “I am glad like it, dear” said his father. “I bought butter little shop round corner.” “It is nice, thank you, father. Oh, there is baby waking! I will take him.” “Sit still, Diamond,” said his mother. “Go bread butter. You are strong enough lift yet.” So she took baby herself, set her knee. Then Diamond began amuse him, went till little fellow shrieking laughter. For baby's world his mother's arms; drizzling rain, dreary mews, even his father's troubled face could touch him. What cared baby loss hundred situations? Yet neither father mother thought hard-hearted he crowed laughed middle troubles. On contrary, his crowing laughing infectious. His little heart full merriment could hold all, ran theirs. Father mother began laugh too, Diamond laughed till he fit coughing frightened his mother, made stop. His father took baby, his mother put bed. But indeed change all, Sandwich, old place, instead great river huge barges mighty brown yellow sails went tacking side side like little pleasure-skiffs, long thin boats shot past eight sometimes twelve rowers, windows looked upon dirty paved yard. And garden Diamond run he pleased, gay flowers his feet, solemn sun-filled trees his head. Neither wooden wall back his bed hole North Wind come she liked. Indeed, high wall, many houses mews, North Wind seldom got place all, except something must done, she grand cleaning like housewives; partition head Diamond's new bed divided room occupied cabman drank much beer, came home chiefly quarrel his wife pinch his children. It dreadful Diamond hear scolding crying. But could make miserable, he back north wind. If reader find hard believe Diamond good, he must remember he back north wind. If he never knew boy good, he ever know boy back north wind? It least strange Diamond behave he did; contrary, thoroughly sensible him. We shall see he got on. CHAPTER XVI. DIAMOND MAKES A BEGINNING THE wind blew loud, Diamond slept deep sleep, never heard it. My impression every time Diamond slept well remembered nothing morning, he night back north wind. I almost sure he woke refreshed, felt quiet hopeful day. Indeed he said much, though me--that always he woke sleep something his mind, he could tell what--could tell whether last far-off sounds river dying away distance, words endless song his mother read sea-shore. Sometimes he thought must twittering swallows--over shallows, you, know; may chirping dingy sparrows picking breakfast yard--how I tell? I do not know I know, I know I think; tell truth, I swallows sparrows. When he knew he coming awake, he would sometimes try hard keep hold words seemed new song, one he heard before--a song words music somehow appeared one; even he thought he got well fixed his mind, ever he came awaker--as he would say--one line faded away it, another, another, till last nothing left lovely picture water grass daisies, something else common, commonness polished it, lovely soul it, people seldom see, and, alas! yet seldomer believe in, shining out. But he would sing oddest, loveliest little songs baby--of his making, his mother said; Diamond said he make them; made somewhere inside him, he knew nothing till coming out. When he woke first morning he got once, saying himself, “I have ill long enough, given great deal trouble; I must try use now, help mother.” When he went her room he found her lighting fire, his father getting bed. They one room, besides little one, much closet, Diamond slept. He began set things rights, baby waking up, he took him, nursed till his mother got breakfast ready. She looking gloomy, his father silent; indeed except Diamond done he possibly could keep misery trying get doors windows, he would grown miserable, would miserable together. But try make others comfortable way get right comfortable ourselves, comes partly able think much helping people. For Selves always pretty well do not pay much attention. Our Selves like little children happy enough long left games, begin interfere them, make presents nice playthings, many sweet things, begin fret spoil. “Why, Diamond, child!” said his mother last, “you are good mother girl--nursing baby, toasting bread, sweeping hearth! I declare body would think among fairies.” Could Diamond greater praise greater pleasure? You see he forgot his Self his mother took care his Self, loved praised his Self. Our praises poison Selves, puff swell up, till lose shape beauty, become like great toadstools. But praises father mother Selves good, comfort make beautiful. They never harm. If harm, comes mixing praises them, turns nasty slimy poisonous. When his father finished his breakfast, he rather hurry, he got went yard get his horse put cab. “Will not come see cab, Diamond?” he said. “Yes, please, father--if mother spare minute,” answered Diamond. “Bless child! I do not want him,” said his mother cheerfully. But he following his father door, she called back. “Diamond, hold baby one minute. I something say father.” So Diamond sat again, took baby his lap, began poking his face little body, laughing singing while, baby crowed like little bantam. And he sang something like this--such nonsense could not understand it! baby, got good world it:-- baby's a-sleeping wake baby swallows merriest fellows yellowest children would go sleeping snore like gaby disturbing his mother father brother a-boring ears his snoring snoring snoring particular wake baby sit perpendicular hark gushing hark rushing sheep woolliest lambs unruliest tails whitest eyes brightest baby's bonniest baby's funniest baby's shiniest baby's tiniest baby's merriest baby's worriest lambs plague dams mother's whitest dams feed lambs go crop-cropping without stop-stopping father's best swallows build nest shining shallows he merriest children that is baby Diamond Diamond baby baby Diamond Diamond baby-- Here Diamond's knees went wild dance tossed baby shook laughter immoderate peals. His mother listening door last lines his song, came tears her eyes. She took baby him, gave kiss, told run his father. By time Diamond got yard, horse shafts, his father looping traces on. Diamond went round look horse. The sight made feel queer. He know much different horses, horses much him. But he could make out. This Diamond was not Diamond. Diamond did not hang his head like that; yet head hanging like one Diamond used hold high. Diamond's bones did not show his skin like that; skin pushed shape like Diamond's skin; bones might Diamond's bones, he never seen shape them. But he came round front old horse, he put his long neck, began sniffing rubbing his upper lip his nose him, Diamond saw could old Diamond, he his father done before--put his arms round his neck cried--but much. “Are not jolly, father?” he said. “Was ever anybody lucky me? Dear old Diamond!” And he hugged horse again, kissed his big hairy cheeks. He could manage one time, however--the cheek far side his big head. His father mounted box air, Diamond thought, he used get upon coach-box, Diamond said himself, “Father's grand ever anyhow.” He kept his brown livery-coat, his wife taken silver buttons put brass ones instead, think polite Mr. Coleman his fallen fortunes let his crest seen upon box cab. Old Diamond kept his collar; silver crest upon still, his master thought nobody would notice that, let remain memorial better days reminded him--not unpleasantly, seeing fault either his old horse's come world together. “Oh, father, let drive bit,” said Diamond, jumping box beside him. His father changed places once, putting reins his hands. Diamond gathered eagerly. “Do not pull his mouth,” said his father, “just feel, gently let know you are attending him. That is I call talking reins.” “Yes, father, I understand,” said Diamond. Then horse he said, “Go Diamond.” And old Diamond's ponderous bulk began move voice little boy. But reached entrance mews, another voice called young Diamond, which, his turn, he obey, his mother. “Diamond! Diamond!” cried; Diamond pulled reins, horse stood still stone. “Husband,” said his mother, coming up, “you are never going trust reins--a baby like that?” “He must learn day, he cannot begin soon. I see already he is born coachman,” said his father proudly. “And I do not see well he could escape it, father grandfather, that is his great-grandfather, coachmen, I am told; must come natural him, one would think. Besides, see, old Diamond's proud selves, wife. Do not see he is turning round his ears, mouths open, first word he speaks tumble in? He is well bred turn his head, know.” “Well, but, husband, I cannot without to-day. Everything's got done, know. It is first day here. And there is baby!” “Bless you, wife! I never meant take away--only bottom Endell Street. He watch his way back.” “No thank you, father; to-day,” said Diamond. “Mother wants me. Perhaps she will let go another day.” “Very well, man,” said his father, took reins Diamond holding him. Diamond got down, little disappointed course, went his mother, pleased speak. She took hold his hand tight she afraid his running away instead glad he would leave her. Now, although know it, owner stables, man sold horse his father, standing inside one stable-doors, his hands his pockets, heard seen passed; day John Stonecrop took great fancy little boy. And beginning came it. The evening, Diamond feeling tired day's work, wishing his father would come home, Mr. Stonecrop knocked door. His mother went opened it. “Good evening, madam,” said he. “Is little master in?” “Yes, sure he is--at service, I am sure, Mr. Stonecrop,” said his mother. “No, no, madam; it is I am his service. I am a-going cab, he likes come me, he shall drive old horse till he is tired.” “It is getting rather late him,” said his mother thoughtfully. “You see he is invalid.” Diamond thought, funny thing! How could he invalid he even know word meant? But, course, his mother right. “Oh, well,” said Mr. Stonecrop, “I let drive Bloomsbury Square, he shall run home again.” “Very good, sir. And I am much obliged you,” said his mother. And Diamond, dancing delight, got his cap, put his hand Mr. Stonecrop's, went yard cab waiting. He think horse looked nearly nice Diamond, Mr. Stonecrop nearly grand his father; he none, less pleased. He got box, his new friend got beside him. “What is horse's name?” whispered Diamond, he took reins man. “It is nice name,” said Mr. Stonecrop. “You need not call it. I did not give him. He will go well enough without it. Give boy whip, Jack. I never carries one I drive old----” He did not finish sentence. Jack handed Diamond whip, which, holding half stick, he managed flack haunches horse; away he went. “Mind gate,” said Mr. Stonecrop; Diamond mind gate, guided nameless horse safety, pulling way according necessary. Diamond learned drive sooner he accustomed he told, could obey smallest hint moment. Nothing helps one get like that. Some people do not know told; used it, neither understand quickly able turn understand action quickly. With obedient mind one learns rights things fast enough; law universe, obey understand. “Look out!” cried Mr. Stonecrop, turning corner Bloomsbury Square. It getting dusky now. A cab approaching rather rapidly opposite direction, Diamond pulling aside, driver pulling up, escaped collision. Then knew other. “Why, Diamond, it is bad beginning run father,” cried driver. “But, father, would not bad ending run son?” said Diamond return; two men laughed heartily. “This kind you, I am sure, Stonecrop,” said his father. “Not bit. He is brave fellow, and'll fit drive his hook week two. But I think you would better let drive home now, his mother do not like his much night air, I promised take farther square.” “Come along then, Diamond,” said his father, he brought his cab other, moved box seat beside it. Diamond jumped across, caught reins, said “Good-night, thank you, Mr. Stonecrop,” drove away home, feeling man he ever yet chance feeling his life. Nor his father find necessary give single hint his driving. Only I suspect fact old Diamond, old Diamond his way his stable, may something young Diamond's success. “Well, child,” said his mother, he entered room, “you have long gone.” “No, mother; I am. Give baby.” “The baby's asleep,” said his mother. “Then give me, I will lay down.” But Diamond took him, he woke began laugh. For he indeed one merriest children. And wonder, he plump plum-pudding, never ache pain lasted five minutes time. Diamond sat began sing him. baby baby babbing father's gone a-cabbing catch shilling pence make baby babbing dance old Diamond's duck say he swim duck diamonds baby that is swallows merriest fellows bake cake water shake river flowing ever make dust clay shiniest day build nest father's best mother's whitest her eyes brightest dams watch lambs cropping grass waters pass singing ever lambs shakingest tails jumpingest feet baby's funniest baby's bonniest he never wails he is always sweet Diamond's his nurse Diamond's his nurse Diamond's his nurse When Diamond's rhymes grew scarce, he always began dancing baby. Some people wondered child could rhyme he did, his rhymes good, he trying remember he heard river sing back north wind. CHAPTER XVII. DIAMOND GOES ON DIAMOND became great favourite men mews. Some may think best place world brought in; must been, he was. At first, he heard good many rough bad words; he like them, little harm. He know least meant, something sound them, tone voice said, Diamond felt ugly. So even stick him, say get inside him. He never took notice them, his face shone pure good middle them, like primrose hailstorm. At first, his face quiet sweet, smile always either awake asleep his eyes, he never heeded ugly words rough jokes, said he was not there, meaning he half idiot, whereas he great deal sense see. And long bad words found ashamed come men's mouths Diamond near. The one would nudge remind boy within hearing, words choked got farther. When talked nicely he always good answer, sometimes smart one, ready, helped much make change minds him. One day Jack gave curry-comb brush try his hand upon old Diamond's coat. He used deftly, gently, yet thoroughly, far he could reach, man could help admiring him. “You must make haste and, grow” he said. “It will not horse's belly clean his back dirty, know.” “Give leg,” said Diamond, moment he old horse's back comb brush. He sat his withers, reaching forward he ate his hay, he curried he brushed, first one side his neck, other. When done he asked dressing-comb, combed his mane thoroughly. Then he pushed his back, his shoulders far he could reach. Then he sat his croup, his back sides; he turned around like monkey, attacked his hind-quarters, combed his tail. This last easy manage, he lift up, every old Diamond would whisk his hands, he sent comb flying stable door, great amusement men. But Jack fetched again, Diamond began more, leave he done whole business fairly well, first-rate, experienced fashion. All time old horse went eating his hay, and, occasional whisk his tail Diamond tickled scratched him, took notice proceeding. But pretence, he knew well perched his back, rubbing away comb brush. So he quite pleased proud, perhaps said something like this-- “I am stupid old horse, cannot brush his coat; there is young godson back, cleaning like angel.” I will not vouch old horse thinking, difficult find old horse thinking. “Oh dear!” said Diamond he done, “I am tired!” And he laid full length old Diamond's back. By time men stable gathered two Diamonds, much amused. One lifted down, time he greater favourite before. And ever boy chance prodigy cab-driving, Diamond boy, strife came box. His mother, however, little shy company him, besides she could always spare him. Also his father liked he could; he desired enjoyed among cabmen. But one way another he learn drive sorts horses, drive well, crowded streets London City. Of course man always box-seat beside him, long seldom least occasion take reins his hands. For one thing he never got frightened, consequently never great hurry. Yet moment came something sharp, he always ready it. I must remind readers he back north wind. One day, neither washing-day, cleaning-day marketing-day, Saturday, Monday--upon consequently Diamond could spared baby--his father took his cab. After stray job two way, drew row upon stand Cockspur Street Pall Mall. They waited long time, nobody seemed want carried anywhere. By ladies would going home Academy exhibition, would chance job. “Though, sure,” said Diamond's father--with truth I cannot say, he believed he said--“some ladies hard, keeps bare sixpence mile, every one knows are not enough keep family cab upon. To sure it is law; mayhap may get law like day themselves.” As hot, Diamond's father got glass beer himself, give another old waterman. He left Diamond box. A sudden noise got up, Diamond looked round see matter. There crossing near cab-stand, girl sweeping. Some rough young imps picked quarrel her, hauling her broom get away her. But pull together, she holding them, scolding entreating alternately. Diamond his box moment, running help girl. He got hold broom her end pulled along her. But boys proceeded rougher measures, one hit Diamond nose, made bleed; he could let go broom mind his nose, he soon dreadful figure. But presently his father came back, missing Diamond, looked about. He look twice, however, he could sure his boy middle tumult. He rushed in, sent assailants flying directions. The girl thanked Diamond, began sweeping nothing happened, his father led away. With help old Tom, waterman, he soon washed decency, his father set box again, perfectly satisfied account he gave his fray. “I could not let behave poor girl--could I, father?” he said. “Certainly not, Diamond,” said his father, quite pleased, Diamond's father gentleman. A moment after, came girl, running, her broom her shoulder, calling, “Cab, there! cab!” Diamond's father turned instantly, he foremost rank, followed girl. One two passing cabs heard cry, made place, girl taken care call till she near enough give her friends first chance. When reached curbstone--who waiting cab Mrs. Miss Coleman! They look cabman, however. The girl opened door them; gave her address, penny; she told cabman, away drove. When reached house, Diamond's father got rang bell. As he opened door cab, he touched his hat he will not do. The ladies stared moment, exclaimed together: “Why, Joseph! you?” “Yes, madam; yes, miss,” answered he, touching his hat, respect he could possibly put action. “It is lucky day I see upon it.” “Who would thought it?” said Mrs. Coleman. “It is changed times us, Joseph, it is often cab even; see daughter still poorly, she cannot bear motion omnibuses. Indeed meant walk bit first took cab, corner, hot sun was, cold wind came street, I saw Miss Coleman must face it. But think fallen upon you, cabmen London! I did not know got cab.” “Well, see, madam, I chance buying old horse, I could not resist him. There he is, looking you, madam. Nobody knows sense head his.” The two ladies went near pat horse, noticed Diamond box. “Why, you have got Diamonds you,” said Miss Coleman. “How do, Diamond?” Diamond lifted his cap, answered politely. “He will fit drive long,” said his father, proudly. “The old horse a-teaching him.” “Well, he must come see us, you have found us out. Where live?” Diamond's father gave ladies ticket his name address printed it; Mrs. Coleman took her purse, saying: “And what is fare, Joseph?” “No, thank you, madam,” said Joseph. “It old horse took you; paid long ago.” He jumped his box she could say another word, parting salute drove off, leaving pavement, maid holding door them. It long time since Diamond seen North Wind, even thought much her. And his father drove along, he thinking her, crossing-sweeper, wondering made feel he knew her quite well, he could remember anything her. But picture arose his mind little girl running wind dragging her broom her; that, degrees, he recalled whole adventure night he got North Wind's back London street. But he could quite satisfy whether whole affair dream he dreamed he little boy. Only he back north wind since--there could doubt that; he woke every morning, he always knew he again. And he thought thought, he recalled another thing happened morning, which, although seemed mere accident, might something happened since. His father intended going stand King's Cross morning, turned Gray's Inn Lane drive there, found way blocked up, upon inquiry informed stack chimneys blown night, fallen across road. They clearing rubbish away. Diamond's father turned, made Charing Cross. That night father mother great deal talk about. “Poor things!” said mother. “it is worse us. You see they have used grand things, come little poky house like that--it breaks heart think it.” “I do not know” said Diamond thoughtfully, “whether Mrs. Coleman bells her toes.” “What mean, child?” said his mother. “She rings her fingers, anyhow,” returned Diamond. “Of course she had, lady would. What it?” “When Sandwich,” said Diamond, “you said would part mother's ring, poor.” “Bless child; he forgets nothing,” said his mother. “Really, Diamond, body would need mind say you.” “Why?” said Diamond. “I think it.” “That is why,” said mother. “Why why?” persisted Diamond, he yet learned grown-up people often much grown never talk like children--and spoilt ones too. “Mrs. Coleman none poor yet. No, thank Heaven! she is come that.” “Is great disgrace poor?” asked Diamond, tone his mother spoken. But his mother, whether conscience-stricken I know hurried away bed, various attempts understand her, resumed resumed spite invading sleep, he conquered last, gave in, murmuring himself, “Why why?” getting answer question. CHAPTER XVIII. THE DRUNKEN CABMAN A FEW nights this, Diamond woke suddenly, believing he heard North Wind thundering along. But something quite different. South Wind moaning round chimneys, sure, she happy night, her voice wakened Diamond. Her voice would lulled deeper asleep. It loud, angry voice, growling like beast, raving like madman; Diamond came little wider awake, he knew voice drunken cabman, wall whose room head his bed. It anything pleasant hear, he could help hearing it. At length came cry woman, scream baby. Thereupon Diamond thought time somebody something, somebody hand, he must go see whether he could something. So he got put part his clothes, went stair, cabman's room open upon stair, he go yard, next door. This, fortunately, cabman, drunk, left open. By time he reached stair, still except voice crying baby, guided right door. He opened softly, peeped in. There, leaning back chair, his arms hanging his sides, his legs stretched supported his heels, sat drunken cabman. His wife lay her clothes upon bed, sobbing, baby wailing cradle. It miserable altogether. Now way people see anything miserable turn away sight, try forget it. But Diamond began usual try destroy misery. The little boy much one God's messengers he angel flaming sword, going fight devil. The devil he fight Misery. And way he fought best. Like wise soldier, he attacked first his weakest point--that baby; Misery never get hold baby grown person. Diamond knowing babies, he knew he could something make baby, happy; although he known one baby yet, although one baby another, yet much alike things, he knew one baby thoroughly, he good reason believe he could something other. I known people would begun fight devil different stupid way. They would begun scolding idiotic cabman; next would make his wife angry saying must her fault well his, leaving ill-bred though well-meant shabby little books read, sure hate sight of; time would put finger touch wailing baby. But Diamond cradle moment, set his knee, told look light. Now light came lamp yard, dingy yellow light, glass lamp dirty, gas bad; light came was, notwithstanding, certainly light come sun itself, baby knew that, smiled it; although indeed wretched room lamp lighted--so dreary, dirty, empty, hopeless!--there middle sat Diamond stool, smiling baby, baby his knees smiling lamp. The father sat staring nothing, neither asleep awake, quite lost stupidity either, he dimly angry himself, he know why. It he struck his wife. He forgotten it, miserable it, notwithstanding. And misery voice great Love made his wife baby Diamond, speaking his heart, telling good. For great Love speaks wretched dirty hearts; tone voice depends echoes place sounds. On Mount Sinai, thunder; cabman's heart misery; soul St. John perfect blessedness. By he became aware voice singing room. This, course, voice Diamond singing baby--song song, every one foolish another cabman, he tipsy part one word another: words mixed his ear gurgle without division stop; way he spoke himself, he horrid condition. But baby content Diamond's songs, Diamond contented songs about, he care bit songs themselves, baby liked them. But cabman good well baby Diamond, put sleep, sleep busy time lasted, smoothing wrinkles his temper. At length Diamond grew tired singing, began talk baby instead. And soon he stopped singing, cabman began wake up. His brain little clearer now, his temper little smoother, his heart quite dirty. He began listen he went listening, heard Diamond saying baby something like this, he thought cabman asleep: “Poor daddy! Baby's daddy takes much beer gin, makes somebody else, his self all. Baby's daddy would never hit baby's mammy he did not take much beer. He is fond baby's mammy, works morning night get her breakfast dinner supper, night he forgets, pays money away beer. And put nasty stuff beer, I have heard daddy say, drives good out, let us bad in. Daddy says man takes drink, there is thirsty devil creeps his inside, he knows he always get enough there. And devil always crying drink, makes man thirsty, he drinks more, till he kills it. And ugly devil creeps him, crawls his belly, looking cabman get into, he may drink, drink, drink. That is daddy says, baby. And he says, too, way make devil come give plenty cold water tea coffee, nothing comes public-house; devil cannot abide kind stuff, creeps pretty soon, fear drowned it. But daddy drink nasty stuff, poor man! I wish he would not, makes mammy cross him, wonder! mammy's cross, he is crosser, there is nobody house take care baby; take care them, baby--do not you, baby? I know do. Babies always take care fathers mothers--do not they, baby? That is come for--is not it, baby? And daddy stops drinking beer nasty gin turpentine it, father says, mammy happy, look pretty! daddy good baby! baby happy swallow, merriest fellow! And Diamond happy too! And Diamond's man, he will take baby box, teach drive cab.” He went chatter like till baby asleep, time he tired, father mother wide awake--only rather confused--the one beer, blow--and staring, one his chair, her bed, Diamond. But he quite unaware notice, he sat half-asleep, his eyes wide open, staring his turn, though without knowing it, cabman, cabman could withdraw his gaze Diamond's white face big eyes. For Diamond's face always rather pale, paler usual sleeplessness, light street-lamp upon it. At length he found nodding, he knew time put baby down, lest he let fall. So he rose little three-legged stool, laid baby cradle, covered up--it well warm night, he want much covering--and he staggered door, he tipsy sleep. “Wife,” said cabman, turning towards bed, “I somehow believe wur angel gone. Did see him, wife? He warn't wery big, he had not got none wingses, know. It wur one baby-angels sees gravestones, know.” “Nonsense, hubby!” said his wife; “but it is good. I might say better, ketch hold like. That is little Diamond everybody knows, duck diamonds he is! No woman could wish better child he be.” “I ha' heerd stable, I never see brat afore. Come, old girl, let bygones bygones, gie us kiss, we will go bed.” The cabman kept his cab another yard, although he his room this. He often late coming home, one take notice children, especially he tipsy, oftener not. Hence, he ever seen Diamond, he know him. But his wife knew well enough, every one else lived day yard. She good-natured woman. It she got fire lighted tea ready Diamond his mother came home Sandwich. And her husband ill-natured man either, morning he recalled Diamond's visit, he behaved his wife, he vexed himself, gladdened his poor wife's heart telling her sorry he was. And whole week after, he go near public-house, hard avoid it, seeing certain rich brewer built one, like trap catch souls bodies in, almost every corner he pass his way home. Indeed, he never quite bad that, though time he began really reform. CHAPTER XIX. DIAMOND'S FRIENDS ONE day old Diamond standing his nose his bag Pall Mall Cockspur Street, his master reading newspaper box his cab, last good many row, little Diamond got run, his legs getting cramped sitting. And first he strolled his hands his pockets crossing, girl her broom found weathers. Just he going speak her, tall gentleman stepped upon crossing. He pleased find clean, streets muddy, he nice boots on; he put his hand his pocket, gave girl penny. But she gave sweet smile return, made pretty courtesy, he looked her again, said: “Where live, child?” “Paradise Row,” she answered; “next door Adam Eve--down area.” “Whom live with?” he asked. “My wicked old grannie,” she replied. “You should not call grannie wicked,” said gentleman. “But she is,” said girl, looking confidently his face. “If do not believe me, come take look her.” The words sounded rude, girl's face looked simple gentleman saw she mean rude, became still interested her. “Still should not say so,” he insisted. “Should not I? Everybody calls her wicked old grannie--even that is wicked her. You hear her swear. There is nothing like Row. Indeed, I assure you, sir, there is never one shut grannie she begins gets right a-going. You must put her passion first, know. It is good till that--she is old now. How she make laugh, sure!” Although she called her wicked, child spoke plainly indicate pride her grannie's pre-eminence swearing. The gentleman looked grave hear her, he sorry nice little girl bad keeping. But he know say next, stood moment his eyes ground. When he lifted them, he saw face Diamond looking his. “Please, sir,” said Diamond, “her grannie's cruel her sometimes, shuts her streets night, she happens late.” “Is brother?” asked gentleman girl. “No, sir.” “How he know grandmother, then? He look like one her sort.” “Oh no, sir! He is good boy--quite.” Here she tapped her forehead her finger significant manner. “What mean that?” asked gentleman, Diamond looked smiling. “The cabbies call God's baby,” she whispered. “He is right head, know. A tile loose.” Still Diamond, though he heard every word, understood too, kept smiling. What could matter people called him, long he nothing he ought do? And, besides, God's baby surely best names! “Well, little man, do?” asked gentleman, turning towards him--just sake saying something. “Drive cab,” said Diamond. “Good; else?” he continued; for, accepting girl said, he regarded still sweetness Diamond's face sign silliness, wished kind poor little fellow. “Nurse baby,” said Diamond. “Well--and else?” “Clean father's boots, make bit toast his tea.” “You are useful little man,” said gentleman. “What else do?” “Not much I know of,” said Diamond. “I cannot curry horse, except somebody puts his back. So I do not count that.” “Can read?” “No. But mother father can, they are going teach day soon.” “Well, here is penny you.” “Thank you, sir.” “And learned read, come me, I will give sixpence book fine pictures it.” “Please, sir, I come?” asked Diamond, much man world know he must gentleman's address he could go see him. “You are silly!” thought he, he put his hand his pocket, brought card. “There,” he said, “your father able read that, tell go.” “Yes, sir. Thank you, sir,” said Diamond, put card his pocket. The gentleman walked away, turning round paces off, saw Diamond give his penny girl, and, walking slower heard say: “I have got father, mother, little brother, you have got nothing wicked old grannie. You may penny.” The girl put beside her pocket, trustworthy article dress she wore. Her grandmother always took care she stout pocket. “Is she cruel ever?” asked Diamond. “Much same. But I gets coppers I used to, I get summats eat, take browns enough home besides keep her grumbling. It is good thing she is blind, though.” “Why?” asked Diamond. “Because she sharp eyes she used be, she would find I never eats her broken wittles, she would know I must get something somewheres.” “Does not she watch you, then?” “OF course she do. Do not she just! But I make believe drop lap, hitch pocket.” “What would she she found out?” “She never give more.” “But do not want it!” “Yes, I want it.” “What it, then?” “Give cripple Jim.” “Who is cripple Jim?” “A boy Row. His mother broke his leg he wur kid, he is never come much; he is good boy, Jim, I love Jim dearly. I always keeps penny Jim--leastways often I can.--But I must sweep again, busses makes end dirt.” “Diamond! Diamond!” cried his father, afraid he might get good talking girl; Diamond obeyed, got upon box. He told his father gentleman, he promised he would learn read, showed gentleman's card. “Why, it is many doors Mews!” said his father, giving back card. “Take care it, boy, may lead something. God knows, hard times man wants many friends he is ever likely get.” “Have not got friends enough, father?” asked Diamond. “Well, I right complain; better, know.” “Just let count,” said Diamond. And he took his hands his pockets, spreading fingers his left hand, began count, beginning thumb. “There is mother, first, baby, me. Next there is old Diamond--and cab--no, I will not count cab, never looks you, Diamond's shafts, it is nobody. Then there is man drinks next door, his wife, his baby.” “They are friends mine,” said his father. “Well, they are friends mine,” said Diamond. His father laughed. “Much good they will you!” he said. “How know will not?” returned Diamond. “Well, go on,” said his father. “Then there is Jack Mr. Stonecrop, and, deary me! mentioned Mr. Coleman Mrs. Coleman, Miss Coleman, Mrs. Crump. And there is clergyman spoke garden day tree blown down.” “What is his name!” “I do not know his name.” “Where he live?” “I do not know.” “How count him, then?” “He talk me, kindlike too.” His father laughed again. “Why, child, you are counting everybody know. That do not make  them friends.” “Do not it? I thought did. Well, shall friends. I shall make  them.” “How that?” “They cannot help then, would. If I choose friend, know, cannot prevent me. Then there is girl crossing.” “A fine set friends have, sure, Diamond!” “Surely she is friend anyhow, father. If had not her, would never got Mrs. Coleman Miss Coleman carry home.” His father silent, he saw Diamond right, ashamed find ungrateful he thought. “Then there is new gentleman,” Diamond went on. “If he he say,” interposed his father. “And should not he? I daresay sixpence are not much spare. But I do not quite understand, father: nobody friend one something you?” “No, I will not say that, boy. You would leave baby then.” “Oh no, I should not. Baby laugh face, crow ears, make feel happy. Call nothing, father?” The father's heart fairly touched now. He made answer last appeal, Diamond ended saying: “And there is best mine come yet--and that is you, daddy--except mother, know. You are friend, daddy, are not you? And I am friend, are not I?” “And God us all,” said his father, silent solemn. CHAPTER XX. DIAMOND LEARNS TO READ THE question tall gentleman whether Diamond could read set his father thinking high time he could; soon old Diamond suppered bedded, he began task night. But much task Diamond, his father took his lesson-book rhymes his mother picked sea-shore; Diamond beginning soon, he learned fast indeed. Within month he able spell verses himself. But he never come upon poem he thought he heard his mother read day. He looked book several times he knew letters words, fancying he could tell look it, always failed find one like another. So he wisely gave search till he could really read. Then he resolved begin beginning, read straight through. This took nearly fortnight. When he almost reached end, he came upon following verses, took his fancy much, although certainly like he search of. LITTLE BOY BLUE Little Boy Blue lost his way wood. Sing apples cherries, roses honey; He said, “I would go back I could, It is jolly funny.” He sang, “This wood own, Apples cherries, roses honey; So I will sit, like king throne, All jolly funny.” A little snake crept tree, Apples cherries, roses honey; “Lie feet, little snake,” said he, All jolly funny. A little bird sang tree overhead, Apples cherries, roses honey; “Come sing song finger instead, All jolly funny.” The snake coiled up; bird flew down, And sang song Birdie Brown. Little Boy Blue found tiresome sit, And he thought he better walk bit. So he got, his way take, And he said, “Come along, little bird snake.” And waves snake damp leaves passed, And snake went first Birdie Brown last; By Boy Blue's head, flutter dart, Flew Birdie Brown song heart. He came apples grew red sweet: “Tree, drop apple feet.” He came cherries hung plump red: “Come mouth, sweet kisses,” he said. And boughs bow down, apples dapple The grass, many grapple. And cheeriest cherries, never miss, Fall his mouth, full-grown kiss. He met little brook singing song. He said, “Little brook, going wrong. “You must follow me, follow me, follow, I say Do I tell you, come way.” And song-singing, sing-songing forest brook Leaped bed took, Followed him, followed. And pale wan, The dead leaves rustled water ran. And every bird high bough, And every creature low below, He called, creatures obeyed call, Took legs wings followed all; Squirrels carried tails like sack, Each his little humpy brown back; Householder snails, slugs tails, And butterflies, flutterbies, ships sails; And weasels, ousels, mice, larks, And owls, rere-mice, harkydarks, All went running, creeping, flowing, After merry boy fluttering going; The dappled fawns fawning, fallow-deer following, The swallows flies, flying swallowing; Cockchafers, henchafers, cockioli-birds, Cockroaches, henroaches, cuckoos herds. The spider forgot followed spinning, And lost his thread end beginning. The gay wasp forgot his rings his waist, He never made undignified haste. The dragon-flies melted mist hurrying. The mole his moleskins left his barrowing burrowing. The bees went buzzing, busy beesy, And midges columns upright easy. But Little Boy Blue content, Calling followers still he went, Blowing his horn, beating his drum, And crying aloud, “Come you, come!” He said shadows, “Come me;” And shadows began flicker flee, And flew wood flattering fluttering, Over dead leaves flickering muttering. And he said wind, “Come, follow; come, follow, With whistle pipe, rustle hollo.” And wind wound round his desire, As he gold cock spire. And cock flew church, And left farmers lurch. They run fly, creep come, Everything, everything, some. The trees tugged roots, Only feet fast boots, After leaning straining bending, As boles he kept walking wending, Till wood he burst lea, Shouting calling, “Come me!” And rose leafy hiss, And stood nothing amiss. Little Boy Blue sat stone, And creatures came round every one. And he said clouds, “I want there.” And sank thin blue air. And he said sunset far West, “Come here; I want you; I know best.” And sunset came stood wold, And burned glowed purple gold. Then Little Boy Blue began ponder: “What is done all, I wonder.” Then Little Boy Blue, he said, quite low, “What I sure I do not know.” Then clouds clodded till dismal grew; The snake sneaked close; round Birdie Brown flew; The brook sat like snake tail; And wind came what-will-you wail; And creatures sat stared; The mole opened his eyes glared; And rats bats world his wife, Little Boy Blue afraid his life. Then Birdie Brown began sing, And he sang thing: “You brought us hither, Little Boy Blue, Pray want us do?” “Go away! go away!” said Little Boy Blue; “I am sure I do not want you--get away--do.” “No, no; no, no; no, yes, no, no,” Sang Birdie Brown, “it must not so. “We cannot nothing come here, away. Give us work, else stay.” “Oh dear! oh dear!” sob sigh, Said Little Boy Blue, began cry. But he got far, he thought thing; And he stood, spoke like king. “Why hustle jostle bother? Off all! Take back mother.” The sunset stood gates west. “Follow me, follow me” came Birdie Brown's breast. “I going way fast I can,” Said brook, sank turned ran. Back woods fled shadows like ghosts: “If stay, shall missed posts.” Said wind voice changed cheer, “I going there, brought here.” “That is I live,” said sack-backed squirrel, And he turned his sack swing swirl. Said cock spire, “His father's churchwarden.” Said brook running faster, “I run his garden.” Said mole, “Two hundred worms--there I caught  them Last year, I am going next autumn.” Said all, “If that is want us steer for, What earth water bring us for?” “Never mind,” said Little Boy Blue; “That is I tell you. If will not do, “I will get once, go home without you. I think I will; I begin doubt you.” He rose; rose snake tail, And hissed three times, half hiss, half wail. Little Boy Blue he tried go past him; But wherever he turned, sat snake faced him. “If do not get way,” he said, “I tell you, snake, I break head.” The snake he neither would go come; So he hit hard stick his drum. The snake fell he dead, And Little Boy Blue set his foot his head. And creatures marched him, And marshalled home high cockolorum. And Birdie Brown sang Twirrrr twitter twirrrr twee-- Apples cherries, roses honey; Little Boy Blue listened me-- All jolly funny. CHAPTER XXI. SAL'S NANNY DIAMOND managed many blunders read rhyme his mother. “Is not nice, mother?” he said. “Yes, it is pretty,” she answered. “I think means something,” returned Diamond. “I am sure I do not know what,” she said. “I wonder it is boy--yes, must same--Little Boy Blue, know. Let see--how rhyme go? Little Boy Blue, come blow horn-- Yes, course is--for one went `blowing his horn beating his drum.' He drum too. Little Boy Blue, come blow horn; The sheep's meadow, cow's corn, He keep out, know. But he was not minding his work. It goes-- Where is little boy looks sheep? He is haystack, fast asleep. There, see, mother! And then, let see-- Who will go wake him? No, I; For I do, he will sure cry. So I suppose nobody wake him. He rather cross little boy, I daresay, woke up. And he wake himself, saw mischief cow done corn, instead running home his mother, he ran away wood lost himself. Do not think that is likely, mother?” “I should not wonder,” she answered. “So see he naughty; even he lost he want go home. Any creatures would shown way he asked it--all snake. He followed snake, know, he took farther away. I suppose young one serpent tempted Adam Eve. Father telling us last Sunday, remember.” “Bless child!” said his mother herself; added aloud, finding Diamond go on, “Well, next?” “I do not know, mother. I am sure there is great deal more, I cannot say. I know he killed snake. I suppose that is he drumstick for. He could not his horn.” “But surely you are silly take true, Diamond?” “I think must be. It looks true. That killing snake looks true. It is I have got often.” His mother looked uneasy. Diamond smiled full her face, added-- “When baby cries will not happy, father talk troubles, I mean.” This little reassure his mother; lest reader his qualms too, I venture remind Diamond back north wind. Finding she made reply, Diamond went on-- “In week so, I shall able go tall gentleman tell I read. And I will ask he help understand rhyme.” But week out, he another reason going Mr. Raymond. For three days, which, one time other, Diamond's father stand near National Gallery, girl her crossing, Diamond got quite anxious her, fearing she must ill. On fourth day, seeing her yet, he said his father, moment shut door his cab upon fare-- “Father, I want go look girl, She cannot well.” “All right,” said his father. “Only take care yourself, Diamond.” So saying he climbed his box drove off. He great confidence his boy, see, would trust anywhere. But he known kind place girl lived, he would perhaps thought twice he allowed go alone. Diamond, know something it, not, however, fear. From talking girl he good notion was, he remembered address well enough; asking his way twenty times, mostly policemen, he came length pretty near place. The last policeman he questioned looked upon summit six feet two inches, replied another question, kindly: “What want there, small kid? It are not bred, I guess.” “No sir” answered Diamond. “I live Bloomsbury.” “That is long way off,” said policeman. “Yes, it is good distance,” answered Diamond; “but I find way pretty well. Policemen always kind me.” “But earth want here?” Diamond told plainly he about, course man believed him, nobody ever disbelieved Diamond. People might think he mistaken, never thought he telling story. “It is ugly place,” said policeman. “Is far off?” asked Diamond. “No. It is next door almost. But it is safe.” “Nobody hurts me,” said Diamond. “I must go you, I suppose.” “Oh, no! please not,” said Diamond. “They might think I going meddle them, I are not, know.” “Well, please,” said man, gave full directions. Diamond set off, never suspecting policeman, kind-hearted man, children his own, following close, watching round every corner. As he went on, he thought he remembered place, whether really so, he laid policeman's instructions well his mind, he went straight cellar old Sal. “He is sharp little kid, anyhow, simple he looks,” said man himself. “Not wrong turn he take! But old Sal's rum un child pay morning visit to. She is worse she is sober she is half drunk. I have seen her she would torn pieces.” Happily Diamond, old Sal gone get gin. When he came her door bottom area-stair knocked, he received answer. He laid his ear door, thought he heard moaning within. So he tried door, found locked! It dreary place indeed,--and dark, window level street, covered mud, grating kept people falling area, stood chest drawers, placed dealer second-hand furniture, shut almost light. And smell place dreadful. Diamond stood still while, he could see next nothing, he heard moaning plainly enough now, When he got used darkness, he discovered his friend lying closed eyes white suffering face heap little better rags corner den. He went her spoke; she made answer. Indeed, she least aware his presence, Diamond saw he could nothing her without help. So taking lump barley-sugar his pocket, he bought her he came along, laying beside her, he left place, already made his mind go see tall gentleman, Mr. Raymond, ask something Sal's Nanny, girl called. By time he got area-steps, three four women seen go standing together top waiting him. They wanted his clothes children; follow lest Sal find there. The moment he appeared, laid hands him, began talking once, wanted get advantage her neighbours. He told quite quietly, he frightened, he come see matter Nanny. “What know Nanny?” said one fiercely. “Wait till old Sal comes home, you will catch it, going prying her house she is out. If do not give jacket directly, I will go fetch her.” “I cannot give jacket,” said Diamond. “It belongs father mother, know. It is mine give. Is now? You would think right give away was not yours--would now?” “Give away! No, I would not; I would keep it,” she said, rough laugh. “But jacket are not yours, right keep it? Here, Cherry, make haste. It will one go apiece.” They began tug jacket, Diamond stooped kept his arms bent resist them. Before done jacket harm, however, suddenly scampered away; Diamond, looking opposite direction, saw tall policeman coming towards him. “You better let come you, little man,” he said, looking Diamond's face, flushed his resistance. “You came right time, thank you,” returned Diamond. “They have done harm.” “They would I had not hand, though.” “Yes; hand, know, could not.” Perhaps answer deeper purport either Diamond policeman knew. They walked away together, Diamond telling his new friend ill poor Nanny was, he going let tall gentleman know. The policeman put nearest way Bloomsbury, stepping good earnest, Diamond reached Mr. Raymond's door less hour. When he asked he home, servant, return, asked he wanted. “I want tell something.” “But I cannot go trouble message that.” “He told come him--that is, I could read--and I can.” “How I know that?” Diamond stared astonishment one moment, answered: “Why, I have told you. That is know it.” But man made coarser grain policeman, and, instead seeing Diamond could tell lie, he put his answer impudence, saying, “Do think I am going take word it?” shut door his face. Diamond turned sat doorstep, thinking tall gentleman must either come come out, he therefore best possible position finding him. He waited long door opened again; he looked round, servant more. “Get, away” he said. “What doorstep?” “Waiting Mr. Raymond,” answered Diamond, getting up. “He is home.” “Then I will wait till he comes,” returned Diamond, sitting smile. What man would done next I know, step sounded hall, Diamond looked round yet again, tall gentleman. “Who is this, John?” he asked. “I do not know, sir. An imperent little boy sit doorstep.” “Please sir” said Diamond, “he told were not home, I sat wait you.” “Eh, what!” said Mr. Raymond. “John! John! This will not do. Is habit turn away visitors? There will one else turn away, I am afraid, I find kind thing. Come in, little man. I suppose you have come claim sixpence?” “No, sir, that.” “What! cannot read yet?” “Yes, I now, little. But I will come next time. I came tell Sal's Nanny.” “Who is Sal's Nanny?” “The girl crossing talked day.” “Oh, yes; I remember. What is matter? Has she got run over?” Then Diamond told all. Now Mr. Raymond one kindest men London. He sent horse put brougham, took Diamond him, drove Children's Hospital. There he well known everybody, he large subscriber, he used go tell children stories afternoon. One doctors promised go find Nanny, could done--have her brought hospital, possible. That night sent litter her, she could use old Sal she better, she object her removed. So she soon lying fever ward--for first time her life nice clean bed. But she knew nothing whole affair. She ill know anything. CHAPTER XXII. MR. RAYMOND'S RIDDLE MR. RAYMOND took Diamond home him, stopping Mews tell his mother he would send back soon. Diamond ran message himself, he reappeared he his hand torn crumpled book North Wind given him. “Ah! I see,” said Mr. Raymond: “you going claim sixpence now.” “I was not thinking much another thing,” said Diamond. “There is rhyme book I cannot quite understand. I want tell means, please.” “I I can,” answered Mr. Raymond. “You shall read get home, I shall see.” Still good many blunders, Diamond read fashion. Mr. Raymond took little book read again. Now Mr. Raymond poet himself, so, although he never back north wind, he able understand poem pretty well. But saying anything it, he read aloud, Diamond thought he understood much better already. “I will tell I think means,” he said. “It means people may way while, like, get troubles they will wish had not it.” “I know, I know!” said Diamond. “Like poor cabman next door. He drinks much.” “Just so,” returned Mr. Raymond. “But people want right, things try help them. Only must kill snake, know.” “I sure snake something it,” cried Diamond triumphantly. A good deal talk followed, Mr. Raymond gave Diamond his sixpence. “What it?” he asked. “Take home mother,” he answered. “She teapot--such black one!--with broken spout, she keeps her money it. It are not much; she saves buy shoes me. And there is baby coming famously, he will want shoes soon. And every sixpence something--are not it, sir?” “To sure, man. I hope you will always make good use money.” “I hope so, sir,” said Diamond. “And here is book you, full pictures stories poems. I wrote myself, chiefly children hospital I hope Nanny going. I do not mean I printed it, know. I made it,” added Mr. Raymond, wishing Diamond understand he author book. “I know mean. I make songs myself. They are awfully silly, please baby, that is they are meant for.” “Could not let hear one now?” said Mr. Raymond. “No, sir, I could not. I forget soon I have done them. Besides, I could not make line without baby knee. We make together, know. They are much baby's mine. It is he pulls me.” “I suspect child's genius,” said poet himself, “and that is makes people think silly.” Now child readers want know genius is--shall I try tell them, shall I not? I give one short answer: means one understands things without body telling mean. God makes teach rest us. “Do like riddles?” asked Mr. Raymond, turning leaves his book. “I do not know riddle is,” said Diamond. “It is something means something else, you have got find something else is.” Mr. Raymond liked old-fashioned riddle best, written few--one he read. I one foot, thousands toes; My one foot stands, never goes. I many arms, they are mighty all; And hundreds fingers, large small. From ends fingers beauty grows. I breathe hair, I drink toes. I grow bigger bigger waist, And yet I always tight laced. None ever saw eat--I have mouth bite; Yet I eat day full sunlight. In summer song I shave quiver, But winter I fast groan shiver. “Do know means, Diamond?” he asked, he finished. “No, indeed, I do not,” answered Diamond. “Then read yourself, think it, see find out,” said Mr. Raymond, giving book. “And better go home mother. When you have found riddle, come again.” If Diamond find riddle order see Mr. Raymond again, I doubt he would ever seen him. “Oh then,” I think I hear little reader say, “he could genius, genius finds things without told.” I answer, “Genius finds truths, tricks.” And understand that, I afraid must content wait till grow older know more. CHAPTER XXIII. THE EARLY BIRD WHEN Diamond got home he found his father home already, sitting fire looking rather miserable, his head ached he felt sick. He night work late, agreed him, he given up, time, he taken kind fever. The next day he forced keep his bed, his wife nursed him, Diamond attended baby. If he ill, would delightful home; first day Diamond sang songs ever baby, his father listened pleasure. But next he could bear even Diamond's sweet voice, ill indeed; Diamond took baby his room, end quiet games there. If he pull his bedding floor, matter, he kept baby quiet, made bed again, slept baby next night, many nights after. But long his father got well, his mother's savings gone. She say word hearing her husband, lest she distress him; one night, she could help crying, she came Diamond's room his father might hear her. She thought Diamond asleep, he not. When he heard her sobbing, he frightened, said-- “Is father worse, mother?” “No, Diamond,” she answered, well she could; “he is good bit better.” “Then crying for, mother?” “Because money almost gone,” she replied. “O mammy, make think little poem baby I learned North Wind's book to-day. Do not remember I bothered words?” “Yes, child,” said his mother heedlessly, thinking she to-morrow. Diamond began repeated poem, he wonderful memory. A little bird sat edge her nest; Her yellow-beaks slept sound tops; That day she done her best, And filled every one little crops. She filled her over-full, And hence she feeling little dull. “Oh, dear!” she sighed, she sat her head Sunk her chest, neck all, While her crop stuck like feather bed Turned inside out, rather small; “What shall I things do not reform? I do not know there is single worm. “I have twenty to-day, children five each, Besides flies, fat spiders: No one say I do not I preach-- I am one best bird-providers; But where is use? We want storm-- I do not know there is single worm.” “There is five crop,” said wee, wee bird, Which woke voice his mother's pain; “I know there is five.” And word He tucked his head, went again. “The folly childhood,” sighed his mother, “Has always especial bother.” The yellow-beaks slept on-- They never heard bogy To-morrow; But mother sat outside, making her moan-- She will soon beg, steal, borrow. For she never tell night before, Where she shall find one red worm more. The fact, I say, was, she would many; She could not sleep, she called virtue, Motherly foresight, affection, Name may call hurt you, So late ere she tucked her head in, And she slept late almost sin. But little fellow knew five Nor troubled his head more, Woke early, felt quite alive, And wanted sixth add his store: He pushed his mother, greedy elf, Then thought he better try himself. When his mother awoke rubbed her eyes, Feeling less like bird, like mole, She saw him--fancy surprise-- Dragging huge worm hole! It Was hero proverb took form: It Is early bird catches worm. “There, mother!” said Diamond, he finished; “are not funny?” “I wish like little bird, Diamond, could catch worms yourself,” said his mother, she rose go look her husband. Diamond lay awake minutes, thinking he could catch worms. It little trouble make his mind, however, still less go sleep it. CHAPTER XXIV. ANOTHER EARLY BIRD HE GOT morning soon he heard men moving yard. He tucked his little brother he could tumble bed, went out, leaving door open, he cry his mother might hear once. When he got yard he found stable-door opened. “I am early bird, I think,” he said himself. “I hope I shall catch worm.” He would ask one help him, fearing his project might meet disapproval opposition. With great difficulty, help broken chair he brought his bedroom, he managed put harness Diamond. If old horse least objection proceeding, course he could done it; even came bridle, he opened his mouth bit, he taking apple Diamond sometimes gave him. He fastened cheek-strap carefully, usual hole, fear choking his friend, else letting bit get amongst his teeth. It job get saddle on; chair he managed it. If old Diamond education physics equal camel, he would knelt let put his back, could expected him, Diamond creep quite get hold girth. The collar almost worst part business; Diamond could help Diamond. He held his head low till his little master got turned round, he lifted his head, shook his shoulders. The yoke rather difficult; he laid traces horse's neck, weight much him. He got right last, led stable. By time several men watching him, would interfere, anxious see he would get various difficulties. They followed far stable-door, stood watching he put horse shafts, got one loops, fastened traces, belly-band, breeching, reins. Then he got his whip. The moment he mounted box, men broke hearty cheer delight his success. But would let go without general inspection harness; although found right, buckle shifted, never allowed time his father ill. The cheer brought his mother window, she saw her little boy setting alone cab gray morning. She tugged window, stiff; she could open it, Diamond, great hurry, mews, almost street. She called “Diamond! Diamond!” answer except Jack. “Never fear him, madam,” said Jack. “It 'ud devil would hurt him, are not many folk 'ud believe. A boy Diamond's size 'arness 'oss t'other Diamond's size, put to, right trivet--if he upset keb-- will fall his feet, madam.” “But he will not upset cab, he, Jack?” “Not he, madam. Leastways he will not go it.” “I know much myself. What mean?” “I mean he is little likely oldest man stable. How is gov'nor to-day, madam?” “A good deal better, thank you,” she answered, closing window fear lest her husband made anxious news Diamond's expedition. He knew pretty well, however, his boy capable of, although quite easy less anxious his mother. But evening drew on, anxiety increased, every sound wheels made his father raise his bed, his mother peep window. Diamond resolved go straight cab-stand he best known, never crawl fear getting annoyed idlers. Before he got across Oxford Street, however, he hailed man wanted catch train, great hurry think driver. Having carried King's Cross good time, got good fare return, he set great spirits, reached stand safety. He first all. As men arrived greeted kindly, inquired his father. “Are not afraid old 'oss running away you?” asked one. “No, he would not run away me,” answered Diamond. “He knows I am getting shillings father. Or he he would run home.” “Well, you are plucky one, girl's looks!” said man; “and I wish ye luck.” “Thank you, sir,” said Diamond. “I will I can. I came old place, see, I knew would let turn here.” In course day one man try cut out, he stranger; shout rest raised let see would do, made far ashamed besides, he went away crawling. Once, block, policeman came him, asked his number. Diamond showed his father's badge, saying smile: “Father's ill home, I came cab. There is fear me. I drive. Besides, old horse could go alone.” “Just well, I daresay. You are pair  them. But rum 'un cabby--are not now?” said policeman. “I do not know I ought let go.” “I are not done nothing,” said Diamond. “It is fault I am bigger. I am big enough age.” “That is is,” said man. “You are not fit.” “How know that?” asked Diamond, his usual smile, turning his head like little bird. “Why, get ruck now, begins move?” “Just get box,” said Diamond, “and I will show you. There, van's a-moving now. Jump up.” The policeman Diamond told him, soon satisfied little fellow could drive. “Well,” he said, he got again, “I do not know I right interfere. Good luck you, little man!” “Thank you, sir,” said Diamond, drove away. In minutes gentleman hailed him. “Are driver cab?” he asked. “Yes, sir” said Diamond, showing his badge, which, he proud. “You are youngest cabman I ever saw. How I know will not break bones?” “I would rather break own,” said Diamond. “But you are afraid, never mind me; I shall soon get another fare.” “I will risk it,” said gentleman; and, opening door himself, he jumped in. He going good distance, soon found Diamond got ground well. Now Diamond go straight ahead, mind much he about, his thoughts always turned riddle Mr. Raymond set him; gentleman looked clever he fancied he must able read him. He given hope finding himself, he could plague his father he ill. He thought answer himself, fancied could right one, see fitted required knowledge physiology. So, he reached end his journey, he got quickly, his head looking window, said, gentleman gathered his gloves newspapers: “Please, sir, tell meaning riddle?” “You must tell riddle first,” answered gentleman, amused. Diamond repeated riddle. “Oh! that is easy enough,” he returned. “It is tree.” “Well, are not got mouth, sure enough; eat day long?” “It sucks food tiniest holes leaves,” he answered. “Its breath food. And cannot except daylight.” “Thank you, sir, thank you,” returned Diamond. “I am sorry I could not find myself; Mr. Raymond would better pleased me.” “But need not tell one told you.” Diamond gave stare came back north wind, kind thing unknown. “That would cheating,” he said last. “Are not cabby, then?” “Cabbies do not cheat.” “Do not they? I different opinion.” “I am sure father do not.” “What is fare, young innocent?” “Well, I think distance good deal three miles--that is two shillings. Only father says sixpence mile little, though cannot ask more.” “You are deep one. But I think you are wrong. It is four miles--not much, is.” “Then that is half-a-crown,” said Diamond. “Well, here is three shillings. Will do?” “Thank kindly, sir. I will tell father good me--first tell riddle, put right distance, give sixpence over. It will help father get well again, will.” “I hope may, man. I should not wonder you are good look, all.” As Diamond returned, he drew stand he never before: time give Diamond his bag chopped beans oats. The men got him, began chaff him. He took good-humouredly, one them, ill-conditioned fellow, began tease old Diamond poking roughly ribs, making general game him. That he could bear, tears came his eyes. He undid nose-bag, put boot, going mount drive away, fellow interfered, would let get up. Diamond endeavoured persuade him, civil, he would his fun him, he said. In minutes group idle boys assembled, Diamond found uncomfortable position. Another cab drew stand, driver got approached assemblage. “What is here?” he asked, Diamond knew voice. It drunken cabman. “Do see young oyster? He pretends drive cab,” said his enemy. “Yes, I see him. And I sees too. You would better leave alone. He are not oyster. He is angel come his business. You off, I will nearer quite agreeable.” The drunken cabman tall, stout man, look one take liberties with. “Oh! he is friend yours,” said other, drawing back. Diamond got nose-bag again. Old Diamond his feed now. “Yes, he friend mine. One best I ever had. It is pity he are not friend yourn. You would better it, are not fault hisn.” When Diamond went home night, he carried one pound one shilling sixpence, besides coppers extra, followed fares. His mother got anxious indeed--so much she almost afraid, she hear sound his cab, go look, lest she yet disappointed, break her husband. But old horse, cab right, Diamond box, his pale face looking triumphant full moon twilight. When he drew stable-door, Jack came out, good many friendly questions congratulations, said: “You go mother, Diamond. I will put old 'oss. I will take care him. He deserve small attention, he do.” “Thank you, Jack,” said Diamond, bounded house, arms his mother, waiting top stair. The poor, anxious woman led his room, sat his bed, took her lap he baby, cried. “How is father?” asked Diamond, almost afraid ask. “Better, child,” she answered, “but uneasy you, dear.” “Did not tell I early bird gone catch worm?” “That put head, it, monkey?” said his mother, beginning get better. “That something else,” answered Diamond, quietly his mother held his head back stared his face. “Well! children!” she said, said more. “And here is worm,” resumed Diamond. But see her face he poured shillings sixpences pence her lap! She burst crying second time, ran money her husband. And pleased he was! It end good. But he counting coins, Diamond turned baby, lying awake his cradle, sucking his precious thumb, took up, saying: “Baby, baby! I have not seen whole year.” And he began sing usual. And he sang this, he happy either make song his sing sense. It one Mr. Raymond's book. THE TRUE STORY OF THE CAT AND THE FIDDLE Hey, diddle, diddle! The cat fiddle! He played merry tune, That cow went mad With pleasure she had, And jumped right moon. But then, do not see? Before could be, The moon come listened. The little dog hearkened, So loud he barkened, “There is nothing like it, is not.” Hey, diddle, diddle! Went cat fiddle, Hey diddle, diddle, dee, dee! The dog laughed sport Till his cough cut short, It hey diddle, diddle, oh me! And back came cow With merry, merry low, For she would humbled man moon. The dish got excited, The spoon delighted, And dish waltzed away spoon. But man moon, Coming back soon From famous town Norwich, Caught dish, Said, “It is I wish To hold cold plum-porridge!” Gave cow rat-tat, Flung water cat, And sent away like rocket. Said, “O Moon are!” Got her car, And went spoon his pocket Hey ho! diddle, diddle! The wet cat wet fiddle, They made caterwauling, That cow fright Stood bolt upright Bellowing now, bawling; And dog his tail, Stretched his neck wail. But “Ho! ho!” said man moon-- “No South Shall I burn mouth, For I have found dish spoon.” CHAPTER XXV. DIAMOND'S DREAM “THERE, baby!” said Diamond; “I am happy I sing nonsense. Oh, father, think poor man, had not cab old Diamond! What I done?” “I do not know indeed could done,” said his father bed. “We starved, precious Diamond,” said his mother, whose pride her boy even greater her joy shillings. Both together made her heart ache, pleasure well pain. “Oh no! should not,” said Diamond. “I could taken Nanny's crossing till she came back; money, instead going Old Sal's gin, would gone father's beef-tea. I wonder Nanny she gets well again. Somebody else sure taken crossing time. I wonder she fight it, whether I shall help her. I will not bother head that. Time enough yet! Hey diddle! hey diddle! hey diddle diddle! I wonder whether Mr. Raymond would take see Nanny. Hey diddle! hey diddle! hey diddle diddle! The baby fiddle! O, mother, I am silly! But I cannot help it. I wish I could think something else, there is nothing come head hey diddle diddle! cat fiddle! I wonder angels do--when they are extra happy, know--when they have driving cabs day taking home money mothers. Do think ever sing nonsense, mother?” “I daresay they have got sort it,” answered his mother, “else would not like people.” She thinking her twenty-one shillings sixpence, nice dinner she would get her sick husband next day, angels nonsense, she said it. But Diamond found her answer right. “Yes, sure,” he replied. “They would not like people had not nonsense sometimes. But must pretty nonsense, like silly hey diddle diddle! cat fiddle! I wish I could get head. I wonder angels' nonsense like. Nonsense good thing, are not it, mother?--a little then; baby, much grown people like cabmen mothers? It is like pepper salt goes soup--that is it--is not it, mother? There is baby fast asleep! Oh, nonsense baby is--to sleep much! Shall I put down, mother?” Diamond chattered away. What rose his happy little heart ran his mouth, his father mother good. When he went bed, he early, tired, may suppose, usual, he still thinking nonsense could like angels sang happy sing sense. But coming conclusion he fell fast asleep. And wonder, must acknowledged difficult question. That night he curious dream I think readers would like told them. They would, least, fond nice dreams I am, do not enough own. He dreamed he running twilight old garden. He thought he waiting North Wind, she come. So he would run back gate, see she there. He ran ran. It good long garden his dream, his dream grown long spread wide gate he wanted nowhere. He ran ran, instead coming gate found beautiful country, like country he ever before. There trees size; nothing bigger fact hawthorns, full may-blossom. The place grew wild dry, mostly covered grass, patches heath. It extended every side far he could see. But although wild, yet wherever ordinary heath might expected furze bushes, holly, broom, grew roses--wild rare--all kinds. On every side, far near, roses glowing. There gum-cistus, whose flowers fall every night come next morning, lilacs syringas laburnums, many shrubs besides, he know names; roses everywhere. He wandered on, wondering would come end. It use going back, house seen anywhere. But he frightened, know Diamond used things rather way. He threw rose-bush, fell asleep. He woke, his dream, it, thinking he heard child's voice, calling “Diamond, Diamond!” He jumped up, still him. The rose-bushes pouring odours clouds. He could see scent like mists colour rose, issuing like slow fountain spreading air till joined thin rosy vapour hung wilderness. But came voice calling him, seemed come his head. He looked up, saw deep blue sky full stars--more brilliant, however, he seen before; sky stars looked nearer earth. While he gazed up, he heard cry. At moment he saw one biggest stars his head give kind twinkle jump, went came again. He threw his back, fixed his eyes upon it. Nor he gazed long went out, leaving something like scar blue. But he went gazing he saw face star been--a merry face, bright eyes. The eyes appeared see Diamond, know Diamond caught sight them, face withdrew moment. Again came voice, calling “Diamond, Diamond;” jumped star place. Diamond called loud he could, right sky: “Here is Diamond, you. What want do?” The next instant many stars round one went out, many voices shouted sky,-- “Come up; come up. We are jolly! Diamond! Diamond!” This followed peal merriest, kindliest laughter, stars jumped places again. “How I come up?” shouted Diamond. “Go round rose-bush. It is got foot it,” said first voice. Diamond got once, walked side rose-bush. There he found seemed opposite he wanted--a stair earth. It turf moss. It seem promise well getting sky, Diamond learned look look things. The voice must meant he go stair; stair Diamond went, without waiting think it. It nice stair, cool soft--all sides well steps grown moss grass ferns! Down Diamond went--a long way, last he heard gurgling splashing little stream; he gone much farther he met it--yes, met coming stairs meet him, running naturally thing. Neither Diamond least surprised see pitching one step another climbed towards him: he never thought odd--and was, there. It would odd here. It made merry tune came, voice like laughter he heard sky. This appeared promising; he went on, stair, stream, till last he came hurried stone, stair stopped altogether. And stream bubbled up, stone shook swayed force; Diamond thought he would try lift it. Lightly rose his hand, forced stream below; and, would seemed unaccountable perversion things he awake, threatened come tumbling upon his head. But he avoided it, fell, got upon it. He saw opening water came pouring his head, help stone he scrambled it, found side grassy hill rounded away every direction, came brook vanished hole. But scarcely he noticed much merry shouting laughter burst upon him, number naked little boys came running, every one eager get first. At shoulders fluttered two little wings, use flying, mere buds; made could help fluttering flying. Just foremost troop reached him, one two fell, rest shouts laughter came tumbling till heaped mound struggling merriment. One another extricated themselves, he got free threw his arms round Diamond kissed him. Diamond's heart ready melt within clear delight. When embraced him,-- “Now let us fun,” cried one, shout scampered hither thither, played wildest gambols grassy slopes. They kept constantly coming back Diamond, however, centre enjoyment, rejoicing found lost playmate. There wind hillside blew like embodiment living gladness. It blew Diamond's heart, made happy he forced sit cry. “Now let us go dig stars,” said one seemed captain troop. They scurried away, soon returned, one another, pickaxe his shoulder spade his hand. As soon gathered, captain led straight line another part hill. Diamond rose followed. “Here begin lesson to-night,” he said. “Scatter dig.” There fun. Each went himself, walking slowly bent shoulders his eyes fixed ground. Every one would stop, kneel down, look intently, feeling his hands parting grass. One would get walk again, another spring his feet, catch eagerly his pickaxe strike ground again, throw aside, snatch his spade, commence digging loosened earth. Now one would sorrowfully shovel earth hole again, trample his little bare white feet, walk on. But another would give joyful shout, much tugging loosening would draw hole lump big his head, bigger his fist; side would pour blaze golden bluish light Diamond's eyes he quite dazzled. Gold blue commoner colours: jubilation greater red green purple. And every time star dug little angels dropped tools crowded it, shouting dancing fluttering wing-buds. When examined well, would kneel one peep hole; always stood back give Diamond first look. All diamond could report, however, was, star-holes he saw great many things places people he knew quite well, somehow different--there something marvellous them--he could tell what. Every time he rose looking star-hole, he felt his heart would break for, joy; he said he cried, he know would become him. As soon looked, star carefully fitted again, little mould strewn it, rest heap left sign star discovered. At length one dug small star lovely colour--a colour Diamond never seen before. The moment angel saw was, instead showing about, he handed one his neighbours, seated edge hole, saying: “This me. Good-bye. I am off.” They crowded him, hugging kissing him; stood back solemn stillness, wings lying close shoulders. The little fellow looked round smile, shot headlong star-hole. Diamond, privileged, threw ground peep him, he saw nothing. “It is use,” said captain. “I never saw anything one went way.” “His wings cannot much use,” said Diamond, concerned fearful, yet comforted calm looks rest. “That is true,” said captain. “He is lost time. They go way. You have not got any, see.” “No,” said Diamond. “I never any.” “Oh! did not you?” said captain. “Some people say,” he added, pause, “that come again. I do not know. I have never found colour I care myself. I suppose I shall day.” Then looked star, put carefully hole, danced around it--but solemnly, called name finder. “Will know again?” asked Diamond. “Oh, yes. We never forget star that is made door of.” Then went searching digging. Diamond neither pickaxe spade, time think. “I do not see little girls,” he said last. The captain stopped his shovelling, leaned his spade, rubbed his forehead thoughtfully his left hand--the little angels left-handed--repeated words “little girls,” then, thought struck him, resumed his work, saying-- “I think I know mean. I have never seen them, course; I suppose that is sort mean. I am told--but mind I do not say so, I do not know--that fall asleep, troop angels like ourselves, quite different, goes round stars discovered, discovers us. I suppose shovelling handling spoil bit; I daresay clouds come make smoky dull sometimes. They say--mind, I say say--these angels take one one, pass round do, breathe it, rub white hands, softer ours, do not pick-and-spade work, smile it, put again: keeps growing dark.” “How jolly!” thought Diamond. “I like see work too.--When go sleep?” he asked captain. “When grow sleepy,” answered captain. “They say--but mind I say say--that others--what call them? I do not know name; I guessing may sort mean--when rounds come near troop us fall asleep. They live west side hill. None us ever top yet.” Even he spoke, he dropped his spade. He tumbled beside it, lay fast asleep. One troop dropped his pickaxe shovel his listless hands, lay fast asleep his work. “Ah!” thought Diamond himself, delight, “now girl-angels coming, I, angel, shall fall asleep like rest, I shall see girl-angels.” But moment he felt growing sleepy. He struggled hard invading power. He put his fingers his eyelids pulled open. But use. He thought he saw glimmer pale rosy light far green hill, ceased know. When he awoke, angels starting wide awake too. He expected see lift tools, no, time play come. They looked happier ever, began sing he stood. He heard sing before. “Now,” he thought, “I shall know kind nonsense angels sing merry. They do not drive cabs, I see, dig stars, work hard enough merry it.” And he hear angels' nonsense; sense them, much sense Diamond made good nonsense it. He tried hard set his mind, listening closely he could, one, another, together. But yet singing he began, his dismay, find he coming awake--faster faster. And he came awake, he found that, goodness his memory, verse verse angels' nonsense vanished it. He always thought he could keep last, next began he lost one it, length awoke, struggling keep hold last verse all. He felt effort keep forgetting one verse vanishing song nearly killed him. And yet time he wide awake he could sure even. It something like this: White hands whiteness Wash stars' faces, Till glitter, glitter, glit, goes brightness Down poor places. This, however, near sense he thought could really sing. CHAPTER XXVI. DIAMOND TAKES A FARE THE WRONG WAY RIGHT THE next morning Diamond almost early before. He nothing fear his mother now, made secret he about. By time he reached stable, several men there. They asked good many questions his luck day before, he told wanted know. But he proceeded harness old horse, pushed aside rough kindness, called baby, began him. So Diamond ran another mouthful tea bread butter; although he never tired he night before, he started quite fresh morning. It cloudy day, wind blew hard north--so hard sometimes that, perched box his toes touching ground, Diamond wished he kind strap fasten lest he blown away. But he really mind it. His head full dream he dreamed; make neglect his work, his work dig stars drive old Diamond pick fares. There many people think beautiful things common work time. But many people back north wind. There much business doing. And Diamond felt rather cold, notwithstanding his mother herself put his comforter helped his greatcoat. But he well aware his dignity get inside his cab do. A cabman ought minding weather--at least Diamond thought. At length he called neighbouring house, young woman heavy box taken Wapping coast-steamer. He find pleasant, far east near river; roughs great force. However, block, even Nightingale Lane, he reached entrance wharf, set his passenger without annoyance. But he turned go back, idlers, content chaffing him, showed mind fare young woman given him. They pulling box, Diamond shouting police, pale-faced man, shabby clothes, look gentleman somewhere him, came up, making good use his stick, drove off. “Now, little man,” he said, “get can. Do not lose time. This place you.” But Diamond habit thinking himself. He saw his new friend looked weary, ill, poor. “Will not jump in, sir?” he said. “I take wherever like.” “Thank you, man; I money; I cannot.” “Oh! I do not want money. I shall much happier get in. You saved I had. I owe lift, sir.” “Which way going?” “To Charing Cross; I do not mind I go.” “Well, I tired. If take Charing Cross, I shall greatly obliged you. I walked Gravesend, hardly penny left get tunnel.” So saying, he opened door got in, Diamond drove away. But he drove, he could help fancying he seen gentleman--for Diamond knew he gentleman--before. Do he could, however, he could recall when. Meantime his fare, may call such, seeing he pay nothing, relief carried made less less inclined carry himself, turning things his mind, and, passed Mint, called Diamond, stopped horse, got went window. “If did not mind taking Chiswick, I able pay got there. It is long way, shall whole fare Docks--and something over.” “Very well, sir” said Diamond. “I shall happy.” He clambering again, gentleman put his head window said-- “It is The Wilderness--Mr. Coleman's place; I will direct come neighbourhood.” It flashed upon Diamond he was. But he got upon his box arrange his thoughts making reply. The gentleman Mr. Evans, Miss Coleman married, Diamond seen several times her garden. I said he behaved well Miss Coleman. He put marriage cowardly fashion, merely he ashamed marry upon small income, live humble way. When man thinks people say case, he may love, his love poor affair. Mr. Coleman took firm junior partner, measure his influence he entered upon speculations ruined him. So his love blessing. The ship North Wind sunk last venture, Mr. Evans gone hope turning cargo best advantage. He one single boat-load managed reach desert island, he gone great many hardships sufferings since then. But he past taught, his troubles done end good, made doubt himself, begin think, he come see he foolish well wicked. For, he Miss Coleman desert island, build her hut, hunt her food, make clothes her, he would thought fortunate men; he home, he would marry till he could afford man-servant. Before he got home again, he even begun understand man make haste rich without going God, case one frightful thing successful. So he come back humble man, longing ask Miss Coleman forgive him. But he idea ruin fallen upon them, he never made thoroughly acquainted firm's affairs. Few speculative people know affairs. Hence he never doubted he find matters much he left them, expected see The Wilderness before. But he fallen Diamond, he would thought going first. What Diamond do? He heard his father mother drop remarks concerning Mr. Evans made doubtful him. He understood he considerate he might been. So he went rather slowly till he make his mind. It was, course, use drive Mr. Evans Chiswick. But he tell befallen them, lived now, he might put going see them, he certain Miss Coleman, least, must want much see Mr. Evans. He pretty sure also best thing case bring together, let set matters right themselves. The moment he came conclusion, he changed his course westward northward, went straight Mr. Coleman's poor little house Hoxton. Mr. Evans tired much occupied his thoughts take least notice streets passed through, suspicion, therefore, change direction. By time wind increased almost hurricane, often head it, joke either Diamonds. The distance, however, great. Before reached street Mr. Coleman lived blew tremendously, Miss Coleman, going little way, opened door, dashed wall bang, she afraid venture, went again. In five minutes after, Diamond drew door. As soon he entered street, however, wind blew right behind them, he pulled up, old Diamond much ado stop cab it, breeching broke. Young Diamond jumped his box, knocked loudly door, turned cab said--before Mr. Evans quite begun think something must amiss: “Please, sir, harness given away. Would mind stepping minutes? They are friends mine. I will take like I have got mended. I shall not many minutes, cannot stand wind.” Half stupid fatigue want food, Mr. Evans yielded boy's suggestion, walked door maid held difficulty wind. She took Mr. Evans visitor, indeed he was, showed room ground-floor. Diamond, followed hall, whispered her she closed door-- “Tell Miss Coleman. It is Miss Coleman he wants see.” “I do not know” said maid. “He do not look much like gentleman.” “He is, though; I know him, Miss Coleman.” The maid could remember Diamond, seen he his father brought ladies home. So she believed him, went he told her. What passed little parlour Miss Coleman came belong story, Diamond. If he known Miss Coleman thought Mr. Evans dead, perhaps he would managed differently. There cry running fro house, quiet again. Almost soon Mr. Evans went in, wind began cease, still. Diamond found making breeching little tighter quite comfortable old horse he could well present; and, thinking better let his bag quiet place, he sat box till old horse eaten his dinner. In little Mr. Evans came out, asked come in. Diamond obeyed, his delight Miss Coleman put her arms round kissed him, payment him! Not mention five precious shillings she gave him, he could refuse his mother wanted much home his father. He left nearly happy themselves. The rest day he better, and, although he much take home day before, yet whole result satisfactory. And story he tell his father mother his adventures, he done, result! They asked multitude questions! he could answer, he could answer; his father seemed ever much better finding his boy already useful his family useful people, quite taking his place man judged wise, work worth doing. For fortnight Diamond went driving his cab, keeping his family. He begun known parts London, people would prefer taking his cab liked heard him. One gentleman lived near mews engaged carry City every morning certain hour; Diamond punctual clockwork--though effect required good deal care, his father's watch much depended on, watched clock St. George's church. Between two, however, he make success it. After fortnight, his father able go again. Then Diamond went make inquiries Nanny, led something else. CHAPTER XXVII. THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL THE first day his father resumed his work, Diamond went usual. In afternoon, however, his father, taken fare neighbourhood, went home, Diamond drove cab rest day. It hard old Diamond work, could afford another horse. They contrived save much possible, fed well, he bravely. The next morning his father much stronger Diamond thought he might go ask Mr. Raymond take see Nanny. He found home. His servant grown friendly time, showed without cross-questioning. Mr. Raymond received his usual kindness, consented once, walked Hospital, close hand. It comfortable old-fashioned house, built reign Queen Anne, her day, doubt, inhabited rich fashionable people: home poor sick children, carefully tended love's sake. There regions London hospital every street might full children, whose fathers mothers dead, unable take care them. When Diamond followed Mr. Raymond room children got worst illness growing better lay, he saw number little iron bedsteads, heads walls, every one child, whose face story itself. In some, health begun appear tinge upon cheeks, doubtful brightness eyes, cold dreary winter spring comes blushing buds bright crocuses. In others signs winter left. Their faces reminded snow keen cutting winds, sunshine soft breezes butterflies; even signs suffering told suffering less, spring-time arrived, yet arrived. Diamond looked round, could see Nanny. He turned Mr. Raymond question his eyes. “Well?” said Mr. Raymond. “Nanny's here,” said Diamond. “Oh, yes, she is.” “I do not see her.” “I do, though. There she is.” He pointed bed right front Diamond standing. “That is Nanny,” he said. “It Nanny. I seen her many times since have. Illness makes great difference.” “Why, girl must back north wind!” thought Diamond, he said nothing, stared; he stared, something old Nanny began dawn face new Nanny. The old Nanny, though good girl, friendly girl, rough, blunt her speech, dirty her person. Her face would always reminded one already back north wind something he seen best company, coarse notwithstanding, partly weather, partly her living amongst low people, partly defend herself: sweet, gentle, refined, she might lady gentleman father mother. And Diamond could help thinking words he heard church day before: “Surely good afflicted;” something like that. North Wind, somehow other, must her! She grown rough girl gentle maiden. Mr. Raymond, however, surprised, he used see lovely changes--something like change passes upon crawling, many-footed creature, turns sick ill, revives butterfly, two wings instead many feet. Instead her take care herself, kind hands ministered her, making her comfortable sweet clean, soothing her aching head, giving her cooling drink she thirsty; kind eyes, stars kingdom heaven, shone upon her; that, fire fever dew tenderness, coarse her melted away, her whole face grown refined sweet Diamond know her. But he gazed, best old face, true good part it, Nanny herself, dawned upon him, like moon coming cloud, length, instead believing Mr. Raymond she, he saw Nanny indeed--very worn grown beautiful. He went her. She smiled. He heard her laugh, never seen her smile before. “Nanny, know me?” said Diamond. She smiled again, question amusing. She likely forget him; although she yet know he got her there, she dreamed often, talked much delirious. Nor much wonder, he boy except Joe ever shown her kindness. Meantime Mr. Raymond going bed bed, talking little people. Every one knew him, every one eager look, smile, kind word him. Diamond sat stool head Nanny's bed. She laid her hand his. No one else her old acquaintance near her. Suddenly little voice called aloud-- “Will not Mr. Raymond tell us story?” “Oh, yes, please do! please do!” cried several little voices also stronger rest. For Mr. Raymond habit telling story he went see them, enjoyed far nice things doctor permitted give them. “Very well,” said Mr. Raymond, “I will. What sort story shall be?” “A true story,” said one little girl. “A fairy tale,” said little boy. “Well,” said Mr. Raymond, “I suppose, difference, I may choose. I cannot think true story moment, I tell sort fairy one.” “Oh, jolly!” exclaimed little boy called fairy tale. “It came head morning I got bed,” continued Mr. Raymond; “and turns pretty well, I write down, get somebody print me, shall read like.” “Then nobody ever heard before?” asked one older child. “No, nobody.” “Oh!” exclaimed several, thinking grand first telling; I daresay might peculiar freshness it, everything would nearly new story-teller listeners. Some sitting lying down, could busy gathering, bustling, shifting fro children generally prepare hear story; faces, turning heads, many feeble exclamations expected pleasure, showed preparations making within them. Mr. Raymond stood middle room, he might turn side side, give share seeing him. Diamond kept his place Nanny's side, her hand his. I know much Mr. Raymond's story smaller children understood; indeed, I do not quite know much understood, story every one take he get. But listened apparent satisfaction, certainly great attention. Mr. Raymond wrote afterwards, is--somewhat altered doubt, good story-teller tries make his stories better every time he tells them. I cannot help thinking he somewhat indebted one old story The Sleeping Beauty. CHAPTER XXVIII. LITTLE DAYLIGHT NO HOUSE pretension called palace least worthy name, except wood near it--very near it--and nearer better. Not round it--I do not mean that, palace ought open sun wind, stand high brave, weathercocks glittering flags flying; one side every palace must wood. And grand wood indeed beside palace king going Daylight's father; grand wood, nobody yet ever got end it. Near house kept trim nice, free brushwood long way in; degrees got wild, grew wilder, wilder, wilder, said wild beasts last liked it. The king his courtiers often hunted, however, kept wild beasts far away palace. One glorious summer morning, wind sun together, vanes flashing flags frolicking blue sky, little Daylight made her appearance somewhere--nobody could tell where--a beautiful baby, bright eyes she might come sun, she showed lively ways she might equally well come wind. There great jubilation palace, first baby queen had, much happiness new baby palace cottage. But one disadvantage living near wood: know quite neighbours may be. Everybody knew several fairies, living within miles palace, always something new baby came; fairies live much longer we, business good many generations human mortals. The curious houses lived well known also,--one, hollow oak; another, birch-tree, though nobody could ever find fairy made house it; another, hut growing trees intertwined, patched turf moss. But another fairy lately come place, nobody even knew she fairy except fairies. A wicked old thing she was, always concealing her power, disagreeable she could, order tempt people give her offence, she might pleasure taking vengeance upon them. The people thought she witch, knew her sight careful avoid offending her. She lived mud house, swampy part forest. In history find fairies give remarkable gifts prince princess, child sufficient importance eyes, always christening. Now understand, ancient custom amongst human beings well; hard explain wicked fairies choose time unkind things; difficult understand able them, would fancy wicked creatures would powerless occasion. But I never knew interference part wicked fairy turn good thing end. What good thing, instance, one princess sleep hundred years! Was she saved plague young men worthy her? And she come awake exactly right moment right prince kissed her? For part, I cannot help wishing good many girls would sleep till fate overtook them. It would happier them, agreeable friends. Of course known fairies invited christening. But king queen never thought inviting old witch. For power fairies nature; whereas witch gets her power wickedness. The fairies, however, knowing danger thus run, provided well could accidents her quarter. But could neither render her powerless, could arrange gifts reference beforehand, could tell might be. Of course old hag without asked. Not asked she wanted, she might sort reason she wished do. For somehow even wickedest creatures likes pretext wrong thing. Five fairies one given child gifts counted best, fifth stepped back her place surrounding splendour ladies gentlemen, when, mumbling laugh her toothless gums, wicked fairy hobbled middle circle, moment archbishop handing baby lady head nursery department state affairs, addressed thus, giving bite two every word she could part it: “Please Grace, I am deaf: would Grace mind repeating princess's name?” “With pleasure, good woman,” said archbishop, stooping shout her ear: “the infant's name little Daylight.” “And little daylight shall be,” cried fairy, tone dry axle, “and little good shall her gifts her. For I bestow upon her gift sleeping day long, whether she not. Ha, ha! He, he! Hi, hi!” Then started sixth fairy, who, course, others arranged come wicked one, order undo much she might. “If she sleep day,” she said, mournfully, “she shall, least, wake night.” “A nice prospect her mother me!” thought poor king; loved her far much give her nurses, especially night, kings queens do--and sorry afterwards. “You spoke I done,” said wicked fairy. “That is law. It gives another chance.” “I beg pardon,” said fairies, together. “She did. I had not done laughing,” said crone. “I got Hi, hi! I go Ho, ho! Hu, hu! So I decree she wakes night she shall wax wane mistress, moon. And may mean I hope her royal parents live see. Ho, ho! Hu, hu!” But stepped another fairy, wise enough keep two reserve, every fairy knew trick one. “Until,” said seventh fairy, “a prince comes shall kiss her without knowing it.” The wicked fairy made horrid noise like angry cat, hobbled away. She could pretend she finished her speech time, she laughed Ho, ho! Hu, hu! “I do not know means,” said poor king seventh fairy. “Do not afraid. The meaning come thing itself,” said she. The assembly broke up, miserable enough--the queen, least, prepared good many sleepless nights, lady head nursery department anything comfortable prospect her, course queen could all. As king, he made his mind, courage he could summon, meet demands case, wondered whether he could propriety require First Lord Treasury take share burden laid upon him. I attempt describe go time. But last household settled regular system--a irregular one respects. For certain seasons palace rang night bursts laughter little Daylight, whose heart old fairy's curse could reach; she Daylight still, little wrong place, she always dropped asleep first hint dawn east. But her merriment short duration. When moon full, she glorious spirits, beautiful possible child her age be. But moon waned, she faded, last she wan withered like poorest, sickliest child might come upon streets great city arms homeless mother. Then night quiet day, little creature lay her gorgeous cradle night day hardly motion, indeed last without even moan, like one dead. At first often thought she dead, last got used it, consulted almanac find moment she would begin revive, which, course, first appearance silver thread crescent moon. Then she would move her lips, would give her little nourishment; she would grow better better better, days she splendidly well. When well, she always merriest moonlight; even near her worst, she seemed better when, warm summer nights, carried her cradle light waning moon. Then her sleep she would smile faintest, pitiful smile. For long time people ever saw her awake. As she grew older she became favourite, however, palace always would contrive keep awake night, order near her. But she soon began take every chance getting away her nurses enjoying her moonlight alone. And thus things went she nearly seventeen years age. Her father mother time got used odd state things ceased wonder them. All arrangements reference state Princess Daylight, amazing things contrive accommodate themselves. But prince ever find deliver her, appeared inconceivable. As she grew older she grown beautiful, sunniest hair loveliest eyes heavenly blue, brilliant profound sky June day. But much painful sad change her bad time came on. The beautiful she full moon, withered worn she become moon waned. At time story arrived, she looked, moon small gone, like old woman exhausted suffering. This painful her appearance unnatural; her hair eyes change. Her wan face drawn wrinkled, eager hungry look. Her skinny hands moved wishing, unable, lay hold something. Her shoulders bent forward, her chest went in, she stooped she eighty years old. At last she put bed, await flow tide life. But she grew dislike seen, still touched hands, season. One lovely summer evening, moon lay gone upon verge horizon, she vanished her attendants, searching her long time great terror, found her fast asleep forest, foot silver birch, carried her home. A little way palace great open glade, covered greenest softest grass. This her favourite haunt; full moon shone free glorious, vista trees she could generally see less dying moon crossed opening. Here she little rustic house built her, she mostly resided. None court might go without leave, her attendants learned time officious waiting upon her, she much liberty. Whether good fairies anything I cannot tell, last she got way retreating wood every night moon waned, sometimes great trouble finding her; she always angry she discovered watching her, scarcely dared so. At length one night thought lost her altogether. It morning found her. Feeble she was, she wandered thicket long way glade, she lay--fast asleep, course. Although fame her beauty sweetness gone abroad, yet everybody knew she bad spell, king neighbourhood desire her daughter-in-law. There serious objections relation. About time neighbouring kingdom, consequence wickedness nobles, insurrection took place upon death old king, greater part nobility massacred, young prince compelled flee his life, disguised like peasant. For time, he got country, he suffered much hunger fatigue; he got ruled princess's father, longer fear recognised, he fared better, people kind. He abandon his disguise, however. One tolerable reason he clothes put on, another he little money, know get more. There good telling everybody he met he prince, he felt prince ought able get like people, else his rank made fool him. He read princes setting upon adventure; he similar case, without choice matter. He would go on, see would come it. For day two he walking palace-wood, next nothing eat, he came upon strangest little house, inhabited nice, tidy, motherly old woman. This one good fairies. The moment she saw she knew quite well he going come it; she liberty interfere orderly march events. She received kindness she would shown traveller, gave bread milk, he thought delicious food he ever tasted, wondering dinner palace sometimes. The old woman pressed stay night. When he awoke he amazed find well strong he felt. She would take money he offered, begged him, he found occasion continuing neighbourhood, return occupy quarters. “Thank much, good mother,” answered prince; “but little chance that. The sooner I get wood better.” “I do not know that,” said fairy. “What mean?” asked prince. “Why, I know?” returned she. “I cannot tell,” said prince. “Very well,” said fairy. “How strangely talk!” said prince. “Do I?” said fairy. “Yes, do,” said prince. “Very well,” said fairy. The prince used spoken fashion, he felt little angry, turned walked away. But offend fairy. She stood door her little house looking till trees hid quite. Then she said “At last!” went in. The prince wandered wandered, got nowhere. The sun sank sank went sight, he seemed nearer end wood ever. He sat fallen tree, ate bit bread old woman given him, waited moon; for, although he much astronomer, he knew moon would rise time, she risen night before. Up she came, slow slow, good size, pretty nearly round indeed; whereupon, greatly refreshed his piece bread, he got went--he knew whither. After walking considerable distance, he thought he coming outside forest; he reached he thought last it, he found upon edge great open space it, covered grass. The moon shone bright, he thought he never seen lovely spot. Still looked dreary loneliness, he could see house side. He sat down, weary again, gazed glade. He seen much room several days. All he spied something middle grass. What could be? It moved; came nearer. Was human creature, gliding across--a girl dressed white, gleaming moonshine? She came nearer nearer. He crept behind tree watched, wondering. It must strange wood--a nymph moonlight warm dusky air enticed her tree. But she came close he stood, he longer doubted she human--for he caught sight her sunny hair, her clear blue eyes, loveliest face form he ever seen. All she began singing like nightingale, dancing her music, her eyes ever turned towards moon. She passed close he stood, dancing edge trees away great circle towards side, he could see spot white yellowish green moonlit grass. But he feared would vanish quite, spot grew, became figure more. She approached again, singing dancing, waving her arms her head, she completed circle. Just opposite his tree she stood, ceased her song, dropped her arms, broke long clear laugh, musical brook. Then, tired, she threw herself grass, lay gazing moon. The prince almost afraid breathe lest he startle her, she vanish his sight. As venturing near her, never came his head. She lain long hour longer, prince began doubt concerning her. Perhaps she vision his fancy. Or she spirit wood, all? If so, he would haunt wood, glad lost kingdom everything hope near her. He would build hut forest, he would live pure chance seeing her again. Upon nights like least she would come bask moonlight, make his soul blessed. But he thus dreamed she sprang her feet, turned her face full moon, began singing she would draw her sky power her entrancing voice. She looked beautiful ever. Again she began dancing her music, danced away distance. Once she returned similar manner; although he watching eagerly before, fatigue gazing, he fell fast asleep she came near him. When he awoke broad daylight, princess nowhere. He could leave place. What she come next night! He would gladly endure day's hunger see her yet again: he would buckle his belt quite tight. He walked round glade see he could discover prints her feet. But grass short, her steps light, she left single trace behind her. He walked half-way round wood without seeing anything account her presence. Then he spied lovely little house, thatched roof low eaves, surrounded exquisite garden, doves peacocks walking it. Of course must gracious lady loved moonlight lived. Forgetting his appearance, he walked towards door, determined make inquiries, he passed little pond full gold silver fishes, he caught sight turned find door kitchen. There he knocked, asked piece bread. The good-natured cook brought in, gave excellent breakfast, prince found nothing worse served kitchen. While he ate, he talked his entertainer, learned favourite retreat Princess Daylight. But he learned nothing more, he afraid seeming inquisitive, cook choose heard talking her mistress peasant lad begged his breakfast. As he rose take his leave, occurred he might far old woman's cottage he thought, he asked cook whether she knew anything place, describing well he could. She said she knew well enough, adding smile-- “It is you are going, it?” “Yes, it is far off.” “It is three miles. But mind about, know.” “Why say that?” “If you are mischief, she will make repent it.” “The best thing could happen circumstances,” remarked prince. “What mean that?” asked cook. “Why, stands reason,” answered prince “that wish anything wrong, best thing made repent it.” “I see,” said cook. “Well, I think may venture. She is good old soul.” “Which way lie here?” asked prince. She gave full instructions; he left her many thanks. Being refreshed, however, prince go back cottage day: he remained forest, amusing best he could, waiting anxiously night, hope princess would appear. Nor he disappointed, for, directly moon rose, he spied glimmering shape far across glade. As drew nearer, he saw she indeed--not dressed white before: pale blue like sky, she looked lovelier still. He thought blue suited her yet better white; he know she really beautiful moon nearer full. In fact next night full moon, princess would zenith her loveliness. The prince feared time she coming near his hiding-place night; circles her dance ever widened moon rose, last embraced whole glade, she came still closer trees he hiding she come night before. He entranced her loveliness, indeed marvellous thing. All night long he watched her, dared go near her. He would ashamed watching her too, he become almost incapable thinking anything beautiful she was. He watched whole night long, saw moon went she retreated smaller smaller circles, last he could see her more. Weary he was, he set old woman's cottage, he arrived time her breakfast, she shared him. He went bed, slept many hours. When he awoke sun down, he departed great anxiety lest he lose glimpse lovely vision. But, whether machinations swamp-fairy, merely one thing go another return road, he lost his way. I shall attempt describe his misery moon rose, he saw nothing trees, trees, trees. She high heavens he reached glade. Then indeed his troubles vanished, princess coming dancing towards him, dress shone like gold, shoes glimmered grass like fireflies. She course still beautiful before. Like embodied sunbeam she passed him, danced away distance. Before she returned her circle, clouds begun gather moon. The wind rose, trees moaned, lighter branches leaned one way it. The prince feared princess would go in, he see her night. But she came dancing jubilant ever, her golden dress her sunny hair streaming upon blast, waving her arms towards moon, exuberance her delight ordering clouds away her face. The prince could hardly believe she creature elements, all. By time she completed another circle, clouds gathered deep, growlings distant thunder. Just she passed tree he stood, flash lightning blinded moment, he saw again, his horror, princess lay ground. He darted her, thinking she struck; she heard coming, she her feet moment. “What want?” she asked. “I beg pardon. I thought--the lightning” said prince, hesitating. “There is nothing matter,” said princess, waving rather haughtily. The poor prince turned walked towards wood. “Come back,” said Daylight: “I like you. You told. Are good?” “Not good I like be,” said prince. “Then go grow better,” said princess. Again disappointed prince turned went. “Come back,” said princess. He obeyed, stood her waiting. “Can tell sun like?” she asked. “No,” he answered. “But where is good asking know?” “But I do not know,” she rejoined. “Why, everybody knows.” “That is thing: I am everybody. I have never seen sun.” “Then cannot know it is like till see it.” “I think must prince,” said princess. “Do I look like one?” said prince. “I cannot quite say that.” “Then think so?” “Because told speak truth.--Is sun bright?” “As bright lightning.” “But does not go like that, it?” “Oh, no. It shines like moon, rises sets like moon, much shape moon, bright cannot look moment.” “But I would look it,” said princess. “But could not,” said prince. “But I could,” said princess. “Why do not you, then?” “Because I cannot.” “Why cannot you?” “Because I cannot wake. And I never shall wake until----” Here she hid her face her hands, turned away, walked slowest, stateliest manner towards house. The prince ventured follow her little distance, she turned made repellent gesture, which, like true gentleman-prince, he obeyed once. He waited long time, she come near again, night cleared, he set last old woman's cottage. It long past midnight he reached it, but, his surprise, old woman paring potatoes door. Fairies fond odd things. Indeed, however may dissemble, night always day. And fairy blood them. “Why, there, time night, mother?” said prince; kind way young man his country would address woman much older himself. “Getting supper ready, son,” she answered. “Oh, I do not want supper,” said prince. “Ah! you have seen Daylight,” said she. “I have seen princess never saw it,” said prince. “Do like her?” asked fairy. “Oh! do not I?” said prince. “More would believe, mother.” “A fairy believe anything ever ever could be,” said old woman. “Then fairy?” asked prince. “Yes,” said she. “Then things believe?” asked prince. “There is plenty them--everything never ever could be.” “Plenty, I grant you,” said prince. “But believe could princess never saw daylight? Do believe now?” This prince said, he doubted princess, he wanted fairy tell more. She old fairy, however, caught easily. “Of people, fairies must tell secrets. Besides, she is princess.” “Well, I will tell secret. I am prince.” “I know that.” “How know it?” “By curl third eyelash left eyelid.” “Which corner count from?” “That is secret.” “Another secret? Well, least, I prince, harm telling princess.” “It is princes I cannot tell.” “There are not them--are there?” said prince. “What! do not think you are prince world, you?” “Oh, dear, no! all. But I know there is one many present, except princess----” “Yes, yes, that is it,” said fairy. “What is it?” asked prince. But he could get nothing fairy, go bed unanswered, something trial. Now wicked fairies bound law good fairies obey, always seems give bad advantage good, use means gain ends others not. But consequence, never succeeds; nay, end brings thing trying prevent. So see somehow, cleverness, wicked fairies dreadfully stupid, for, although beginning world really helped instead thwarting good fairies, one bit wiser it. She try bad thing her; succeeds better course. The prince far stolen march upon swamp-fairy she know he neighbourhood he seen princess three times. When she knew it, she consoled herself thinking princess must far proud modest young man venture even speak her he seen her six times least. But even less danger wicked fairy thought; for, however much princess might desire set free, she dreadfully afraid wrong prince. Now, however, fairy going she could. She contrived her deceitful spells, next night prince could endeavour find his way glade. It would take long tell her tricks. They would amusing us, know could harm, something amusing poor prince. He wandered forest till daylight, fell fast asleep. The thing occurred seven following days, neither could he find good fairy's cottage. After third quarter moon, however, bad fairy thought she might ease affair fortnight least, chance prince wishing kiss princess period. So first day fourth quarter he find cottage, next day he found glade. For nearly another week he haunted it. But princess never came. I little doubt she farther edge part every night, period she always wore black, and, little light, prince never saw her. Nor would he known her he seen her. How could he taken worn decrepit creature she now, glorious Princess Daylight? At last, one night moon all, he ventured near house. There he heard voices talking, although past midnight; her women considerable uneasiness, one whose turn watch her fallen asleep, seen way she went, night she would probably wander far, describing circle touch open glade all, stretched away back house, deep side forest--a part prince knew nothing. When he understood said she disappeared, she must gone somewhere said direction, he plunged wood see he could find her. For hours he roamed nothing guide vague notion circle one side bordered house, much he picked talk he overheard. It getting towards dawn, yet streak light sky, he came great birch-tree, sat weary foot it. While he sat--very miserable, may sure--full fear princess, wondering her attendants could take quietly, he bethought would bad plan light fire, which, she anywhere near, would attract her. This he managed tinder-box, good fairy given him. It beginning blaze up, he heard moan, seemed come side tree. He sprung his feet, his heart throbbed he lean moment tree he could move. When he got round, lay human form little dark heap earth. There light enough his fire show princess. He lifted his arms, hardly heavier child, carried flame. The countenance old woman, fearfully strange look. A black hood concealed her hair, her eyes closed. He laid her comfortably he could, chafed her hands, put little cordial bottle, also gift fairy, her mouth; took his coat wrapped her, short best he could. In little she opened her eyes looked him--so pitifully! The tears rose flowed her grey wrinkled cheeks, she said never word. She closed her eyes again, tears kept flowing, her whole appearance utterly pitiful prince near crying too. He begged her tell matter, promising he could help her; still she speak. He thought she dying, took her his arms carry her princess's house, he thought good-natured cook might able something her. When he lifted her, tears flowed yet faster, she gave sad moan went his heart. “Mother, mother!” he said. “Poor mother!” kissed her withered lips. She started; eyes opened upon him! But he see them, still dark, he enough make his way trees towards house. Just he approached door, feeling tired he could imagined possible--she little thin old thing--she began move, became restless that, unable carry her moment longer, he thought lay her grass. But she stood upright her feet. Her hood dropped, her hair fell her. The first gleam morning caught her face: face bright never-aging Dawn, her eyes lovely sky darkest blue. The prince recoiled overmastering wonder. It Daylight herself he brought forest! He fell her feet, dared look she laid her hand upon his head. He rose then. “You kissed I old woman: there! I kiss I young princess,” murmured Daylight.--“Is sun coming?” CHAPTER XXIX. RUBY THE children delighted story, made many amusing remarks upon it. Mr. Raymond promised search his brain another, he found one bring them. Diamond taken leave Nanny, promised go see her soon, went away him. Now Mr. Raymond turning his mind he could Diamond Nanny. He therefore made acquaintance Diamond's father, greatly pleased him. But he come resolution, he anything good he would like them, put certain test. So walked away together, he began talk Diamond follows:-- “Nanny must leave hospital soon, Diamond.” “I am glad that, sir.” “Why? Do not think it is nice place?” “Yes, very. But it is better well something, know, even it is quite comfortable.” “But cannot keep Nanny long would like. They cannot keep her till she is quite strong. There always many sick children want take make better. And question is, What she send her again?” “That is I cannot tell, though I have thinking over, sir. Her crossing taken long ago, I could not bear see Nanny fighting it, especially poor fellow taken it. He is quite lame, sir.” “She does not look much like fighting, now, she, Diamond?” “No, sir. She looks like angel. Angels do not fight--do they, sir?” “Not get things themselves, least,” said Mr. Raymond. “Besides,” added Diamond, “I do not quite see she would better right crossing boy got it. Nobody gave her; she took it. And he taken it.” “If she sweep crossing--soon least--after illness she had, she would laid first wet day,” said Mr. Raymond. “And there is hardly money got except wet days,” remarked Diamond reflectively. “Is nothing else she could do, sir?” “Not without taught, I am afraid.” “Well, could not somebody teach her something?” “Could not teach her, Diamond?” “I do not know anything myself, sir. I could teach her dress baby; nobody would give her anything things like that: easy. There would not much good teaching her drive cab, would she get cab drive? There are not fathers old Diamonds everywhere. At least poor Nanny cannot find them, I doubt.” “Perhaps she taught nice clean, speak gentle words.” “Mother could teach her that,” interrupted Diamond. “And dress babies, feed them, take care them,” Mr. Raymond proceeded, “she might get place nurse somewhere, know. People give money that.” “Then I will ask mother,” said Diamond. “But you will give her her food then; father, strong, enough already without that.” “But here is me,” said Diamond: “I help it. When he is tired driving, I get. It do not make difference old Diamond. I do not mean he likes well father--of course he cannot, know--nobody could; he his duty same. It is got done, know, sir; Diamond's good horse--is not he, sir?” “From description I say certainly; I pleasure his acquaintance myself.” “Do not think he go heaven, sir?” “That I do not know anything about,” said Mr. Raymond. “I confess I glad think so,” he added, smiling thoughtfully. “I am sure he will get back north wind, anyhow,” said Diamond himself; he learned careful saying things aloud. “Is not rather much go cab day every day?” resumed Mr. Raymond. “So father says, he feels his ribs morning. But he says old horse eat well, moment he is his supper, he goes, never gets till he is called; and, legs him, father says makes end differ. Some horses, sir! will not lie night long, go sleep four pins, like haystack, father says. I think it is stupid them, old Diamond. But I suppose do not know better, cannot help it. We must not hard upon them, father says.” “Your father must good man, Diamond.” Diamond looked Mr. Raymond's face, wondering he could mean. “I said father must good man, Diamond.” “Of course,” said Diamond. “How could he drive cab he was not?” “There men drive cabs good,” objected Mr. Raymond. Diamond remembered drunken cabman, saw his friend right. “Ah, but,” he returned, “he must be, know, horse old Diamond.” “That make difference,” said Mr. Raymond. “But quite enough he good man without trying account it. Now, like, I give proof I think good man. I going away Continent while--for three months, I believe--and I going let house gentleman want use brougham. My horse nearly old, I fancy, Diamond, I do not want part him, I do not want idle; nobody, say, ought idle; neither I want worked hard. Now, come head perhaps father would take charge him, work certain conditions.” “My father what is right,” said Diamond. “I am sure that.” “Well, I think. Will ask he comes home call little chat me--to-day, time?” “He must his dinner first,” said Diamond. “No, he is got his dinner to-day. It must he is his tea.” “Of course, course. Any time do. I shall home day.” “Very well, sir. I tell him. You may sure he come. My father thinks kind gentleman, I know he right, I know self, sir.” Mr. Raymond smiled, reached his door, parted, Diamond went home. As soon his father entered house, Diamond gave Mr. Raymond's message, recounted conversation preceded it. His father said little, took thought-sauce his bread butter, soon he finished his meal, rose, saying: “I go friend directly, Diamond. It would grand thing get little money. We want it.” Diamond accompanied his father Mr. Raymond's door, left him. He shown Mr. Raymond's study, he gazed wonder multitude books walls, thought learned man Mr. Raymond must be. Presently Mr. Raymond entered, saying much his old horse, made following distinct proposal--one over-advantageous Diamond's father, he reasons--namely, Joseph use Mr. Raymond's horse he away, condition he never worked six hours day, fed well, that, besides, he take Nanny home soon she able leave hospital, provide her one his children, neither better worse--so long, is, he horse. Diamond's father could help thinking pretty close bargain. He girl horse feed, six hours' work horse. “It save horse,” said Mr. Raymond. “That true,” answered Joseph; “but I get horse enough keep us, I save feed horse girl--do not see, sir?” “Well, go home think it, let know end week. I hurry then.” So Joseph went home recounted proposal his wife, adding he think much advantage got it. “Not much way, husband,” said Diamond's mother; “but would advantage, matter gets it!” “I do not see it,” answered her husband. “Mr. Raymond gentleman property, I do not discover much good helping save little more. He will not easily get one make bargain, I do not mean he shall get me. It would loss rather gain--I think--at least I took less work horse.” “One hour would make difference old Diamond. But that is main point. You must think advantage would poor girl has not home go to!” “She one Diamond's friends,” thought his father. “I could kind her, know,” mother went on, “and teach her housework, handle baby; and, besides, she would help me, I stronger it, able odd bit charing then, I got chance.” “I will not hear that,” said her husband. “Have girl means. I am ashamed I think sides thing once. I wonder horse great eater. To sure, I gave Diamond two hours' additional rest, would better old bones him, would four hours extra horse. That would give Diamond something every day. He could drive old Diamond dinner, I could take horse six hours tea, morning, I found best. It might pay keep them,--that is, I good luck. I like oblige Mr. Raymond, though he rather hard, he kind Diamond, wife. Has not he now?” “He indeed, Joseph,” said his wife, conversation ended. Diamond's father went next day Mr. Raymond, accepted his proposal; week got another stall stable, he two horses instead one. Oddly enough, name new horse Ruby, he red chestnut. Diamond's name came white lozenge his forehead. Young Diamond said rich now, big diamond big ruby. CHAPTER XXX. NANNY'S DREAM NANNY fit moved time yet, Diamond went see her often he could. But regularly engaged now, seeing he went every day hours old Diamond, his baby mind, one horses attend to, he could go often he would liked. One evening, he sat her bedside, she said him: “I have beautiful dream, Diamond! I like tell you.” “Oh! do,” said Diamond; “I fond dreams!” “She must back north wind,” he said himself. “It foolish dream, know. But somehow pleasant! What good thing believe dream time it!” My readers must suppose poor Nanny able say she meant well I put here. She never school, heard little else vulgar speech she came hospital. But I school, although could never make able dream well Nanny, made able tell her dream better she could herself. And I desirous her I already done best I could Diamond's dream, would shame give boy advantage. “I tell I know it,” said Nanny. “The day yesterday, lady came see us--a beautiful lady, beautifully dressed. I heard matron say her kind her come blue gold; she answered she knew did not like dull colours. She lovely shawl on, like redness dipped milk, worked flowers colour. It did not shine much, silk, kept shine. When she came bedside, she sat down, sitting, Diamond, laid her hand counterpane. I sitting up, table ready tea. Her hand looked pretty blue glove, I tempted stroke it. I thought she would not angry, everybody comes hospital kind. It is streets are not kind. But she drew her hand away, I almost cried, I thought I rude. Instead that, however, she did not like giving her glove stroke, she drew off, laid her hand before. I was not sure, I ventured put ugly hand.” “Your hand are not ugly, Nanny,” said Diamond; Nanny went on-- “And I stroked again, she stroked mine,--think that! And ring her finger, I looked see like. And she drew off, put upon one fingers. It red stone, she told called ruby.” “Oh, funny!” said Diamond. “Our new horse called Ruby. We have got another horse--a red one--such beauty!” But Nanny went her story. “I looked ruby time lady talking me,--it beautiful! And she talked I kept seeing deeper deeper stone. At last she rose go away, I began pull ring finger; think she said?--'Wear night, like. Only must take care it. I cannot give you, one gave me; may keep till to-morrow.' Was not kind her? I could hardly take tea, I delighted hear it; I think ring set dreaming; for, I taken tea, I leaned back, half lying half sitting, looked ring finger. By degrees I began dream. The ring grew larger larger, last I found I looking red stone, red sunset, shone end long street near Grannie lives. I dressed rags I used be, I great holes shoes, nasty mud came feet. I did not use mind before, I thought horrid. And great red sunset, streaks green gold between, standing looking me. Why could not I live sunset instead dirt? Why far away always? Why never come wretched street? It faded away, sunsets always do, last went altogether. Then cold wind began blow, flutter rags about----” “That North Wind herself,” said Diamond. “Eh?” said Nanny, went her story. “I turned back it, wandered away. I know I going, warmer go way. I do not think north wind, I found west end last. But does not matter dream wind was.” “I do not know that,” said Diamond. “I believe North Wind get dreams--yes, blow them. Sometimes she blown dream altogether.” “I do not know mean, Diamond,” said Nanny. “Never mind,” answered Diamond. “Two people cannot always understand other. They would back north wind directly, would become places without them?” “You talk oddly!” said Nanny. “I sometimes think must right you.” “What say me?” asked Diamond. “They called God's baby.” “How kind them! But I knew that.” “Did know meant, though? It meant right head.” “I feel right,” said Diamond, putting hands his head, globe he could take set again. “Well, long pleased I pleased,” said Nanny. “Thank you, Nanny. Do go story. I think I like dreams even better fairy tales. But must nice ones, like yours, know.” “Well, I went on, keeping back wind, I came fine street top hill. How happened I do not know, front door one houses open, front door, back door well, I could see right house--and think I saw? A garden place green grass, moon shining upon it! Think that! There moon street, house moon. I looked nobody near: I would harm, grass much nicer mud! But I could not think going grass dirty shoes: I kicked gutter, ran bare feet, steps, house, grass; moment I came moonlight, I began feel better.” “That is North Wind blew there,” said Diamond. “It came Mr. Raymond's story Princess Daylight,” returned Nanny. “Well, I lay upon grass moonlight without thinking I get again. Somehow moon suited exactly. There breath north wind talk about; quite gone.” “You did not want her more, then. She never goes she is wanted,” said Diamond. “But she blew moonlight, anyhow.” “Well, will not dispute it,” said Nanny: “you have got tile loose, know.” “Suppose I have,” returned Diamond, “do not see may let moonlight, sunlight matter?” “Perhaps yes, perhaps no,” said Nanny. “And you have got dreams, too, Nanny.” “Yes, I know they are dreams.” “So I. But I know besides something well.” “Oh! you?” rejoined Nanny. “I do not.” “All right,” said Diamond. “Perhaps day.” “Perhaps I will not,” said Nanny. Diamond held his peace, Nanny resumed her story. “I lay long time, moonlight got every tear clothes, made feel happy----” “There, I tell you!” said Diamond. “What tell me?” returned Nanny. “North Wind----” “It moonlight, I tell you,” persisted Nanny, Diamond held his peace. “All I felt moon shining strong. I looked up, cloud, crapey fluffy, trying drown beautiful creature. But moon round, like whole plate, cloud could not stick her. She shook off, said shone clearer brighter ever. But came thicker cloud,--and 'You shall not,' said moon; 'I will,' said cloud,--but could not: shone moon, quite laughing impudence. I knew her ways, I have always used watch her. She is thing worth looking street night.” “Do not call street,” said Diamond. “You are going back it. You are coming us, know.” “That is good true,” said Nanny. “There things good enough true,” said Diamond; “but I hope is. Too good true cannot be. Is not true good? is not good good? And how, then, anything good true? That is like old Sal--to say that.” “Do not abuse Grannie, Diamond. She is horrid old thing, she her gin bottle; she will repent day, you will glad said anything her.” “Why?” said Diamond. “Because you will sorry her.” “I sorry her now.” “Very well. That is right. She will sorry too. And there will end it.” “All right. You come us,” said Diamond. “Where I?” said Nanny. “Telling moon served clouds.” “Yes. But would not do, it. Up came clouds clouds, came faster faster, moon covered up. You could not expect her throw hundred once--could you?” “Certainly not,” said Diamond. “So grew dark; dog began yelp house. I looked saw door garden shut. Presently opened--not let out, let dog in--yelping bounding. I thought he caught sight me, I biting first, police after. So I jumped up, ran little summer-house corner garden. The dog came me, I shut door his face. It well door--was not it?” “You dreamed door wanted it,” said Diamond. “No, I did not; came itself. It there, true dream.” “There--I have caught you!” said Diamond. “I knew believed dream much I do.” “Oh, well, lay traps body!” said Nanny. “Anyhow, I safe inside summer-house. And think?--There moon beginning shine again--but one panes--and one colour ruby. Was not funny?” “No, bit funny,” said Diamond. “If contrary!” said Nanny. “No, no,” said Diamond; “I meant pane I expected her shine through.” “Oh, well!” returned Nanny. What Diamond meant, I pretend say. He curious notions things. “And now,” said Nanny, “I did not know do, dog kept barking door, I could not get out. But moon beautiful I could not keep looking red pane. And I looked got larger larger till filled whole pane outgrew it, I could see panes; grew till filled whole window, summer-house nearly bright day. “The dog stopped barking, I heard gentle tapping door, like wind blowing little branch it.” “Just like her,” said Diamond, thought everything strange beautiful must done North Wind. “So I turned window opened door; think I saw?” “A beautiful lady,” said Diamond. “No--the moon itself, big little house, round ball, shining like yellow silver. It stood grass--down grass: I could see nothing else brightness it: And I stared wondered, door opened side it, near ground, curious little old man, crooked thing his shoulder, looked out, said: 'Come along, Nanny; lady wants you. We are come fetch you.” I was not bit frightened. I went beautiful bright thing, old man held his hand, I took hold it, gave jump, he gave lift, I inside moon. And think like? It pretty little house, blue windows white curtains! At one windows sat beautiful lady, her head leaning her hand, looking out. She seemed rather sad, I sorry her, stood staring her. “`You did not think I beautiful mistress that!' said queer little man. `No, indeed!' I answered: `who would thought it?' `Ah! indeed? But see do not know everything.' The little man closed door, began pull rope hung behind weight end. After he pulled while, he said--`There, do; we are right now.' Then he took hand opened little trap floor, led two three steps, I saw like great hole me. `Do not frightened,' said tittle man. `It is hole. It is window. Put face look through.' I he told me, garden summer-house, far away, lying bottom moonlight. `There!' said little man; `we have brought off! Do see little dog barking us garden?' I told I could not see anything far. `Can see anything small far off?' I said. `Bless you, child!' said little man; `I could pick needle grass I long enough arm. There is one lying door summer-house now.' I looked his eyes. They small, bright I think he saw light went them. Then he took up, little stair corner room, another trapdoor, one great round window us, I saw blue sky clouds, lots stars, big shining hard ever could!” “The little girl-angels polishing them,” said Diamond. “What nonsense talk!” said Nanny. “But nonsense good yours, Nanny. When done, I will tell dream. The stars it--not moon, though. She away somewhere. Perhaps she gone fetch then. I do not think that, though, dream longer ago yours. She might fetch one else, though; cannot fancy it is us get fine things done them. But tell came next.” Perhaps one child-readers may remember whether moon came fetch her night Diamond his dream. I cannot tell, course. I know she come fetch me, though I think I could make her follow I boy--not tiny one either. “The little man took round house, made look every window. Oh, beautiful! There were, air, nice, clean little house! `Your work keep windows bright,' said little man. `You will not find difficult, are not much dust here. Only, frost settles sometimes, drops rain leave marks them.' `I easily clean inside,' I said; `but I get frost rain outside them?' `Oh!' he said, `it is quite easy. There ladders about. You have got go door, climb about. There great many windows have not seen yet, look places do not know anything about. I used clean myself, I am getting rather old, see. Are not I now?' `I cannot tell,' I answered. `You see I never saw younger.' `Never saw man moon?' said he. `Not near,' I answered, `not tell young old he looked. I seen bundle sticks his back.' For Jim pointed me. Jim fond looking man moon. Poor Jim! I wonder he has not see me. I am afraid he is ill too.” “I will try find out,” said Diamond, “and let know.” “Thank you,” said Nanny. “You Jim ought friends.” “But man moon say, told seen bundle sticks his back?” “He laughed. But I thought he looked offended too. His little nose turned sharper, he drew corners his mouth tips his ears his neck. But he did not look cross, know.” “Did not he say anything?” “Oh, yes! He said: `That is nonsense. What saw bundle dusters. I going clean windows. It takes good many, know. Really, say superiors there!' `It is do not know better,' I ventured say. `Of course, course,' said little man. `Nobody ever know better. Well, I forgive them, sets right, I hope.' `It is good you,' I said. `No!' said he, `it is least good me. I could not comfortable otherwise.' After he said nothing while, I laid floor his garret, stared around great blue beautifulness. I forgotten almost, last he said: `Are not done yet?' `Done what?' I asked. `Done saying prayers,' says he. 'I was not saying prayers,' I answered. `Oh, yes, were,' said he, `though did not know it! And I must show something else.' “He took hand led stair again, narrow passage, another, another, another. I do not know could room many passages little house. The heart must ever much farther sides other. How could inside independent outside? There is point. It funny--was not it, Diamond?” “No,” said Diamond. He going say much sort thing back north wind; he checked added, “All right. I do not see it. I do not see inside depend outside. It are not crabs. They creep outsides make new ones. Mr. Raymond told so.” “I do not see got it,” said Nanny. “Then go story, please,” said Diamond. “What come to, going winding passages heart moon?” “I did not say winding passages. I said long narrow. They did not wind. They went corners.” “That is worth knowing,” remarked Diamond. “For knows soon he may go there? But main thing is, come last?” “We came small box wall tiny room. The little man told put ear it. I so, heard noise something like purring cat, loud, much sweeter. `What it?' I asked. `Do not know sound?' returned little man. `No,' I answered. `Do not know sound bees?' he said. I never heard bees, could know sound them. `Those lady's bees,' he went on. I heard bees gather honey flowers. `But flowers them?' I asked. `My lady's bees gather honey sun stars,' said little man. `Do let see them,' I said. `No. I dare not that,' he answered. `I business them. I do not understand them. Besides, bright one fly eye, would blind altogether.' `Then seen them?' `Oh, yes! Once twice, I think. But I do not quite know: bright--like buttons lightning. Now I have showed I to-night, we will go back room.' I followed him, he made sit lamp hung roof, gave bread honey. “The lady never moved. She sat her forehead leaning her hand, gazing little window, hung like rest white cloudy curtains. From I sitting I looked too, I could see nothing. Her face beautiful, white, still, her hand white forehead leaned it. I see her whole face--only side it, she never moved turn full upon me, even look me. “How long I sat I eaten bread honey, I do not know. The little man busy room, pulling string here, string there, chiefly string back door. I thinking uneasiness he would soon wanting go clean windows, I did not fancy job. At last he came great armful dusters. `It is time set windows,' he said; `for there is rain coming, they are quite clean before, rain cannot spoil them.' I got once. `You need not afraid,' he said. `You will not tumble off. Only must careful. Always hold one hand rub other.' As he spoke, he opened door. I started back terrible fright, nothing blue air seen me, like great water without bottom all. But must must, live much nicer mud holes shoes, I never thought I told. The little man showed lay hold I put foot round edge door first round ladder. `Once you are up,' he said, `you will see go well enough.' I he told me, crept carefully. Then little man handed bundle dusters, saying, `I always carry reaping hook, I do not think could manage properly. You shall like.' I would not take it, however, looked dangerous. “I best I could dusters, crawled top moon. But grand sight was! The stars head, bright near I could almost laid hold them. The round ball I clung went bobbing floating away dark blue every side. It beautiful fear left me, I set work diligently. I cleaned window window. At length I came little one, I peeped. There room box bees it! I laid ear window, heard musical hum quite distinctly. A great longing see came upon me, I opened window crept in. The little box door like closet. I opened it--the tiniest crack--when came light sting I closed terror--not, however, three bees shot room, darted like flashes lightning. Terribly frightened, I tried get window again, I could not: way outside moon door; room lady sat. No sooner I reached room, three bees, followed me, flew lady, settled upon her hair. Then first I saw her move. She started, put her hand, caught them; rose and, held flame lamp one other, turned me. Her face sad stern. It frightened much. `Nanny, got trouble,' she said. `You letting bees, I manage. You forced burn them. It great loss, storm.' As she spoke, clouds gathered us. I could see come crowding white windows. `I sorry find,' said lady, `that trusted. You must go home again--you will not us.' Then came great clap thunder, moon rocked swayed. All grew dark me, I fell floor lay half-stunned. I could hear everything could see nothing. `Shall I throw her door, lady?' said little man. `No,' she answered; `she is quite bad enough that. I do not think there is much harm her; she will never us. She would make dreadful mischief here. She is fit mud. It is great pity. I sorry her. Just take ring her finger. I sadly afraid she stolen it.' The little man caught hold hand, I felt tugging ring. I tried speak true it, but, terrible effort, gave groan. Other things began come head. Somebody else hold me. The little man was not there. I opened eyes last, saw nurse. I cried sleep, she come waked me. But, Diamond, dream, I cannot help ashamed yet opening lady's box bees.” “You would not again--would you--if she take back?” said Diamond. “No. I do not think anything would ever make again. But where is good? I shall never chance.” “I do not know that,” said Diamond. “You silly baby! It dream,” said Nanny. “I know that, Nanny, dear. But tell may not dream again?” “That is bit likely.” “I do not know that,” said Diamond. “You are always saying that,” said Nanny. “I do not like it.” “Then I will not say again--if I do not forget.” said Diamond. “But beautiful dream!--was not it, Nanny? What pity opened door let bees out! You might long dream, nice talks moon-lady. Do try go again, Nanny. I want hear more.” But nurse came told time go; Diamond went, saying himself, “I cannot help thinking North Wind something dream. It would tiresome lie day night too--without dreaming. Perhaps she had not done that, moon might carried her back north wind--who knows?” CHAPTER XXXI. THE NORTH WIND DOTH BLOW IT WAS great delight Diamond length Nanny well enough leave hospital go home house. She strong yet, Diamond's mother considerate her, took care she nothing she quite fit for. If Nanny taken straight street, probable she would pleasant decent household, easy teach; refining influences her illness kind treatment she hospital, she moved house like rather sad pleasure haunting mind. As she got better, colour came back her cheeks, her step grew lighter quicker, her smile shone readily, became certain she would soon treasure help. It great fun see Diamond teaching her hold baby, wash dress him, often laughed together her awkwardness. But she many lessons she able perform duties quite well Diamond himself. Things however go well Joseph arrival Ruby. It almost seemed red beast brought ill luck him. The fares fewer, pay less. Ruby's services indeed make week's income first little beyond used be, two feed. After first month he fell lame, whole next Joseph dared attempt work him. I cannot say he never grumbled, his health far been; I say he tried his best. During month, lived short commons indeed, seldom tasting meat except Sundays, poor old Diamond, worked hardest all, even then--so end he thin clothes-horse, Ruby plump sleek bishop's cob. Nor much better Ruby able work again, season great depression business, soon felt amongst cabmen. City men look shillings, wives daughters less spend. It besides wet autumn, bread rose greatly price. When I add Diamond's mother poorly, new baby coming, see jolly times friends mews. Notwithstanding depressing influences around him, Joseph able keep little hope alive his heart; he came home night, would get Diamond read him, would also make Nanny produce her book he might see she getting on. For Diamond taken her education hand, she clever child, she soon able put letters words together. Thus three months passed away, Mr. Raymond return. Joseph looking anxiously him, chiefly desire getting rid Ruby--not he absolutely use him, he constant weight upon his mind. Indeed, far provision went, he rather worse Ruby Nanny he before, hand, Nanny great help house, comfort think new baby come, Nanny would his wife. Of God's gifts baby greatest; therefore wonder one came, she heartily welcomed little household she brought plenty her. Of course she made great difference work done--far difference her size warranted, Nanny end help, Diamond much sunbeam ever, began sing new baby first moment he got her his arms. But he sing songs her he sung his brother, for, he said, she new baby must new songs; besides, she sister-baby brother-baby, course would like kind songs. Where difference his songs lay, however, I pretend able point out. One thing I sure of, small share education little girl, helped whole family great deal aware. How managed get long dreary expensive winter, I hardly say. Sometimes things better, sometimes worse. But last spring came, winter gone, much. Still, Mr. Raymond return, although mother would able manage without Nanny now, could look place her long Ruby; altogether sorry this. One week last worse yet had. They almost without bread over. But sadder he saw his father mother looking, Diamond set sing two babies. One thing increased expenses forced hire another little room Nanny. When second baby came, Diamond gave his room Nanny might hand help his mother, went hers, which, although fine place she accustomed to, nice his eyes. He mind change though, his mother comfortable it? And Nanny comfortable too? And indeed Diamond comfortable people comfortable? And comfort every way, change happy one. CHAPTER XXXII. DIAMOND AND RUBY IT WAS Friday night, Diamond, like rest household, little eat day. The mother would always pay week's rent she laid anything even food. His father gloomy--so gloomy he actually cross his wife. It strange thing pain seeing suffering love sometimes make us add suffering cross them. This comes faith enough God, shows necessary faith is, lose it, lose even kindness alone soothe suffering. Diamond consequence gone bed quiet thoughtful--a little troubled indeed. It stormy winter, even spring come, north wind often blew. When Diamond went his bed, tiny room roof, he heard like sea moaning; he fell asleep he still heard moaning. All he said himself, “Am I awake, I asleep?” But he time answer question, North Wind calling him. His heart beat fast, long time since he heard voice. He jumped bed, looked everywhere, could see her. “Diamond, come here,” she said again; he could tell. To sure room quite dark, she might close beside him. “Dear North Wind,” said Diamond, “I want much go you, I cannot tell where.” “Come here, Diamond,” her answer. Diamond opened door, went room, stair yard. His little heart flutter, he long given thought seeing her again. Neither he see her. When he got out, great puff wind came him, obedience he turned his back, went blew. It blew right stable-door, went blowing. “She wants go stable,” said Diamond himself, “but door locked.” He knew key was, certain hole wall--far high get at. He ran place, however: he reached came wild blast, fell key clanging stones his feet. He picked up, ran back opened stable-door, went in. And think he saw? A little light came dusty window gas-lamp, sufficient show Diamond Ruby two heads up, looking across partition stalls. The light showed white mark Diamond's forehead, Ruby's eye shone bright, he thought light came went in. This he saw. But think he heard? He heard two horses talking other--in strange language, yet, somehow other, he could understand, turn his mind English. The first words he heard Diamond, apparently already quarrelling Ruby. “Look fat Ruby!” said old Diamond. “You plump skin shines so, ought ashamed yourself.” “There is harm fat,” said Ruby deprecating tone. “No, sleek. I may well shine not.” “No harm?” retorted Diamond. “Is harm go eating poor master's oats, taking much his time grooming you, work six hours--no, six hours day, and, I hear, get along faster big dray-horse two tons behind him?--So tell me.” “Your master's mine,” said Ruby. “I must attend master's interests, eat given me, sleek fat I can, go faster I need.” “Now really rest horses were not asleep, poor things--they work till they are tired--I believe would get kick stable. You make ashamed horse. You dare say master are not master! That is gratitude way he feeds spares you! Pray would carcass were not him?” “He does not sake. If I his horse, he would work hard he you.” “And I am proud worked. I would not fat you--not you are worth. You are disgrace stable. Look horse next you. He is something like horse--all skin bone. And his master are not kind either. He put stinging lash his whip last week. But old horse knows he is got wife children keep--as well his drunken master--and he works like horse. I daresay he grudges his master beer he drinks, I do not believe he grudges anything else.” “Well, I do not grudge he gets me,” said Ruby. “Gets!” retorted Diamond. “What he gets is not worth grudging. It comes next nothing--what fat shine. “Well, least ought thankful you are better it. You get two hours' rest day it.” “I thank master that--not you, lazy fellow! You go along like buttock beef upon castors--you do.” “Are not afraid I will kick, go like that, Diamond?” “Kick! You could not kick tried. You might heave rump half foot, lashing out--oho! If did, you would belly could get legs again. It is belief, out, they would stick ever. Talk kicking! Why do not put one foot you are cab? The abuse master gets sake quite shameful. No decent horse would bring him. Depend upon it, Ruby, cabman likes abused his fare. But his fares, least shafts, much excused. Indeed are.” “Well, see, Diamond, I do not want go lame again.” “I do not believe lame all--there!” “Oh, I was.” “Then I believe fault. I am lame. I never lame life. You do not take care legs. You never lay night. There huge carcass crushing poor legs night long. You do not even care legs--so long eat, eat, sleep, sleep. You horse indeed!” “But I tell I lame.” “I am denying puffy look off-pastern. But belief is, was not even grease--it fat.” “I tell I put foot one horrid stones make roads with, gave ankle twist.” “Ankle indeed! Why ape betters? Horses are not got ankles: they are pasterns. And long do not lift feet better, fall asleep every step, you will run good chance laming ankles call them, one another. It is lively horse comes grief way. I tell I believe was not much, was, fault. There! I have done. I am going sleep. I will try think well I can. If would step bit run little fat!” Here Diamond began double his knees; Ruby spoke again, and, young Diamond thought, rather different tone. “I say, Diamond, I cannot bear honest old horse like think like that. I tell truth: fault I fell lame.” “I told so,” returned other, tumbling partition he rolled his side give his legs every possible privilege narrow circumstances. “I meant it, Diamond.” At words, old horse arose scramble like thunder, shot his angry head glaring eye Ruby's stall, said-- “Keep way, unworthy wretch, I will bite you. You horse! Why that?” “Because I wanted grow fat.” “You grease-tub! Oh! teeth tail! I thought humbug! Why want get fat? There is truth got cross-questioning. You are not fit horse.” “Because I fat, nature keep fat long time; I did not know master might come home want see me.” “You conceited, good-for-nothing brute! You are fit knacker's yard. You wanted look handsome, you? Hold tongue, I will break halter you--with handsome fat!” “Never mind, Diamond. You are good horse. You cannot hurt me.” “Cannot hurt you! Just let try.” “No, cannot.” “Why then?” “Because I am angel.” “What is that?” “Of course do not know.” “Indeed I do not.” “I know do not. An ignorant, rude old human horse, like you, could not know it. But there is young Diamond listening we are saying; he knows well enough horses heaven angels ride upon, well animals, lions eagles bulls, important situations. The horses angels ride, must angel-horses, else angels could not ride upon them. Well, I am one them.” “You are not.” “Did ever know horse tell lie?” “Never before. But you have confessed shamming lame.” “Nothing sort. It necessary I grow fat, necessary good Joseph, master, grow lean. I could pretended lame, horse, least angel-horse would do. So I must lame, I sprained ankle--for angel-horses ankles--they do not talk horse-slang there--and hurt much, I assure you, Diamond, though may not good enough able believe it.” Old Diamond made reply. He lain again, sleepy snort, like snore, revealed that, he already asleep, he past understanding word Ruby saying. When young Diamond found this, he thought he might venture take dropt shuttlecock conversation. “I am good enough believe it, Ruby,” he said. But Ruby never turned his head, took notice him. I suppose he understand English coachman stableman habit addressing with. Finding, however, his companion made reply, he shot his head partition looking said-- “You wait till to-morrow, you will see whether I am speaking truth not.--I declare old horse fast asleep!--Diamond!--No I will not.” Ruby turned away, began pulling his hayrack silence. Diamond gave shiver, looking round saw door stable open. He began feel he dreaming, glance stable see North Wind anywhere visible, he thought he better go back bed. CHAPTER XXXIII. THE PROSPECT BRIGHTENS THE next morning, Diamond's mother said his father, “I am quite comfortable child again.” “Which child, Martha?” asked Joseph. “You have got choice now.” “Well, Diamond I mean. I am afraid he is getting his queer ways again. He is his old trick walking his sleep. I saw run stair middle night.” “Did not go him, wife?” “Of course I did--and found fast asleep his bed. It is he is little meat last six weeks, I am afraid.” “It may that. I am sorry. But do not please God send us enough, I do, wife?” “You cannot help it, I know, dear good man,” returned Martha. “And I do not know. I do not see he should not get well rest us. There I am nursing baby time, I get along pretty well. I am sure, hear little man singing, would not think much amiss him.” For moment Diamond singing like lark clouds. He new baby his arms, his mother dressing herself. Joseph sitting his breakfast--a little weak tea, dry bread, dubious butter--which Nanny set him, he enjoying he hungry. He groomed horses, got old Diamond harnessed ready put to. “Think fat angel, Dulcimer!” said Diamond. The baby christened yet, Diamond, reading his Bible, come upon word dulcimer, thought pretty ever he called his sister Dulcimer! “Think red, fat angel, Dulcimer!” he repeated; “for Ruby's angel horse, Dulcimer. He sprained his ankle got fat purpose.” “What purpose, Diamond?” asked his father. “Ah! I cannot tell. I suppose look handsome his master comes,” answered Diamond.--“What think, Dulcimer? It must good, Ruby's angel.” “I wish I rid him, anyhow,” said his father; “for he weighs heavy mind.” “No wonder, father: he is fat,” said Diamond. “But need not afraid, everybody says he is better condition him.” “Yes, he may thin tin horse his owner comes. It bad leave hands way.” “Perhaps he could not help it,” suggested Diamond. “I daresay he good reason it.” “So I said,” returned his father, “if he driven hard bargain first.” “But do not know may come yet, husband,” said his wife. “Mr. Raymond may give little boot, seeing you have bargain wanted reckoned upon.” “I am afraid not: he is hard man,” said Joseph, he rose went get his cab out. Diamond resumed his singing. For time he carolled snatches everything anything; last settled something like follows. I cannot tell he got it. Where come from, baby dear? Out everywhere here. Where get eyes blue? Out sky I came through. What makes light sparkle spin? Some starry spikes left in. Where get little tear? I found waiting I got here. What makes forehead smooth high? A soft hand stroked I went by. What makes cheek like warm white rose? I saw something better one knows. Whence three-cornered smile bliss? Three angels gave kiss. Where get pearly ear? God spoke, came hear. Where get arms hands? Love made hooks bands. Feet, whence come, darling things? From box cherubs' wings. How come you? God thought me, I grew. But come us, dear? God thought you, I here. “You never made song, Diamond,” said his mother. “No, mother. I wish I had. No, I do not. That would take somebody else. But it is mine that.” “What makes yours?” “I love so.” “Does loving thing make yours?” “I think so, mother--at least anything else can. If I did not love baby (which could not be, know) she would not mine bit. But I love baby, baby Dulcimer.” “The baby's mine, Diamond.” “That makes her mine, mother.” “How make out?” “Because you are mine, mother.” “Is love me?” “Yes, because. Love makes myness,” said Diamond. When his father came home his dinner, change Diamond Ruby, saw look sad, he told he fare worth mentioning whole morning. “We shall go workhouse, wife,” he said. “It would better go back north wind,” said Diamond, dreamily, intending say aloud. “So would,” answered his father. “But get there, Diamond?” “We must wait till we are taken,” returned Diamond. Before his father could speak again, knock came door, walked Mr. Raymond smile his face. Joseph got received respectfully, cordially. Martha set chair him, he would sit down. “You glad see me,” he said Joseph. “You do not want part old horse.” “Indeed, sir, mistaken there. What anxiety him, bad luck, I have wished I rid thousand times. It three months, it is eight nine.” “I am sorry hear statement,” said Mr. Raymond. “Has not he service you?” “Not much, his lameness” “Ah!” said Mr. Raymond, hastily--“you have laming him--have you? That accounts it. I see, I see.” “It was not fault, he is right now. I do not know happened, but--” “He purpose,” said Diamond. “He put his foot stone twist his ankle.” “How know that, Diamond?” said his father, turning him. “I never said so, I could think came.” “I heard it--in stable,” answered Diamond. “Let us look him,” said Mr. Raymond. “If you will step yard,” said Joseph, “I will bring out.” They went, Joseph, first taken his harness, walked Ruby middle yard. “Why,” said Mr. Raymond, “you have using well.” “I do not know mean that, sir. I did not expect hear you. He is sound wind limb--as sound barrel.” “And big, might add. Why, he is fat pig! You do not call good usage!” Joseph angry make answer. “You have worked enough, I say. That is making good use him. That is you would done by.” “I should not sorry I served same, sir.” “He is fat, I say.” “There whole month I could not work all, he nothing eat his head off. He is awful eater. I have taken best part six hours day since, I am always afraid his coming grief again, I could not make even that. I declare you, sir, he is shafts, I sit box miserable I would stolen him. He looks time he bottling complaints make minute he set eyes again. There! look now, squinting round one eye! I declare you, word, I have not laid whip three times.” “I am glad hear it. He never want whip.” “I did not say that, sir. If ever horse wanted whip, he do. He is brought beggary almost his snail's pace. I am glad you have come rid him.” “I do not know that,” said Mr. Raymond. “Suppose I ask buy me--cheap.” “I would not present, sir. I do not like him. And I would not drive horse I did not like--no, gold. It cannot come good there is love  them.” “Just bring horse, let see sort pair they would make.” Joseph laughed rather bitterly he went fetch Diamond. When two placed side side, Mr. Raymond could hardly keep his countenance, mingling feelings. Beside great, red, round barrel, Ruby, body legs, Diamond looked like clothes-horse skin thrown it. There hardly spot could descry sign bone underneath. Gaunt grim weary he stood, kissing his master, heeding one else. “You have not using well,” said Mr. Raymond. “I must say,” returned Joseph, throwing arm round his horse's neck, “that remark better spared, sir. The horse worth three now.” “I do not think so. I think make nice pair. If one's fat, other's lean--so that is right. And will not buy Ruby, I must buy Diamond.” “Thank you, sir,” said Joseph, tone implying anything thanks. “You do not seem like proposal,” said Mr. Raymond. “I do not,” returned Joseph. “I would not part old Diamond his skin full nuggets bones.” “Who said anything parting him?” “You now, sir.” “No; I did not. I spoke buying make pair Ruby. We could pare Ruby patch Diamond bit. And height, near match I care about. Of course would coachman--if would consent reconciled Ruby.” Joseph stood bewildered, unable answer. “I have bought small place Kent,” continued Mr. Raymond, “and I must pair carriage, roads hilly thereabouts. I do not want make show pair high-steppers. I think do. Suppose, week two, set take Ruby bring Diamond up. If could lay pipe Ruby's sides Diamond's, would work moment. But I fear would not answer.” A strong inclination laugh intruded upon Joseph's inclination cry, made speech still harder before. “I beg pardon, sir,” he said length. “I have miserable, long, I never thought chaffing said I had not used horses well. I grumble you, sir, many's time trouble; whenever I said anything, little Diamond would look smile, much say: 'I know better you, father;' upon word, I always thought boy must right.” “Will sell old Diamond, then?” “I will, sir, one condition--that ever want part me, give option buying him. I could part him, sir. As calls his, that is nothing; for, Diamond says, it is loving thing make yours--and I love old Diamond, sir, dearly.” “Well, there is cheque twenty pounds, I wrote offer him, case I find done handsome thing Ruby. Will enough?” “It is much, sir. His body are not worth it--shoes all. It is his heart, sir--that is worth millions--but his heart'll mine same--so it is much, sir.” “I do not think so. It will not be, least, time we have got fed again. You take welcome. Just go cabbing another month, take Ruby let Diamond rest; time I shall ready go country.” “Thank you, sir, thank you. Diamond set friend, sir, moment he saw you. I believe child mine knows people.” “I think so, too,” said Mr. Raymond he walked away. He meant test Joseph he made bargain Ruby, intention greatly prolonging trial. He taken ill Switzerland, quite unable return sooner. He went away highly gratified finding he stood test, true man. Joseph rushed his wife standing window anxiously waiting result long colloquy. When she heard horses go together double harness, she burst forth immoderate fit laughter. Diamond came baby his arms made big anxious eyes her, saying-- “What matter you, mother dear? Do cry little. It good. When father takes ever small drop spirits, he puts water it.” “You silly darling!” said his mother; “how could I laugh notion great fat Ruby going side side poor old Diamond?” “But not, mother? With month's oats, nothing do, Diamond'll nearer Ruby's size father's. I think it is good different sorts go together. Now Ruby chance teaching Diamond better manners.” “How dare say thing, Diamond?” said his father, angrily. “To compare two manners, there is comparison possible. Our Diamond's gentleman.” “I do not mean say he is not, father; I daresay gentlemen judge neighbours unjustly. That is I mean. Diamond should not thought bad things Ruby. He did not try make best him.” “How know that, pray?” “I heard talking one night.” “Who?” “Why Diamond Ruby. Ruby's angel.” Joseph stared said more. For his new gladness, he gloomy he re-harnessed angel, he thought his darling Diamond going his mind. He could help thinking rather differently, however, he found change come Ruby. Considering his fat, he exerted amazingly, got ground incredible speed. So willing, even anxious, he go now, Joseph hold quite tight. Then he laughed his fancies, new fear came upon lest horse break his wind, Mr. Raymond good think he using well. He might even suppose he taken advantage his new instructions, let upon horse his pent-up dislike; whereas truth, utterly vanished he felt Ruby, too, his friend time. CHAPTER XXXIV. IN THE COUNTRY BEFORE end month, Ruby got respectably thin, Diamond respectably stout. They really began look fit double harness. Joseph his wife got affairs order, everything ready migrating shortest notice; felt peaceful happy judged trouble gone well worth enduring. As Nanny, she happy ever since she left hospital, she expected nothing better, saw nothing attractive notion country. At time, she least idea word country meant, she never seen anything her streets gas-lamps. Besides, she attached Jim Diamond: Jim reasonable being, Diamond her eyes best amiable, over-grown baby, amount expostulation would ever bring talk sense, say think it. Now she could manage baby well he, she judged herself altogether his superior. Towards his father mother, she could wish. Diamond taken great deal pains trouble find Jim, last succeeded help tall policeman, glad renew his acquaintance strange child. Jim moved his quarters, heard Nanny's illness till time she taken hospital, he shy go inquire her. But length she went live Diamond's family, Jim willing enough go see her. It one his visits, talking her new prospects, Nanny expressed Diamond her opinion country. “There are not nothing sun moon, Diamond.” “There is trees flowers,” said Diamond. “Well, are not count,” returned Nanny. “Are not they? They are beautiful, make happy look them.” “That is you are silly.” Diamond smiled far-away look, he gazing clouds green leaves vision contented him. But he thinking he could Nanny; evening he went find Mr. Raymond, he heard he returned town. “Ah! do, Diamond?” said Mr. Raymond; “I glad see you.” And he indeed, he grown fond him. His opinion different Nanny's. “What want now, child?” he asked. “I am always wanting something, sir,” answered Diamond. “Well, that is quite right, long want right. Everybody always wanting something; do not mention right place often enough. What now?” “There is friend Nanny's, lame boy, called Jim.” “I have heard him,” said Mr. Raymond. “Well?” “Nanny does not care much going country, sir.” “Well, Jim?” “You could not find corner Jim work in--could you, sir?” “I do not know I could not. That is, show good reason it.” “He is good boy, sir.” “Well, much better him.” “I know he shine boots, sir.” “So much better us.” “You want boots shined country--do not you, sir?” “Yes, sure.” “It would not nice walk flowers dirty boots--would it, sir?” “No, indeed.” “They would not like it--would they?” “No, would not.” “Then Nanny would better pleased go, sir.” “If flowers did not like dirty boots walk them, Nanny would not mind going country? Is it? I do not quite see it.” “No, sir; I did not mean that. I meant, would take Jim clean boots, odd jobs, know, sir, Nanny would like better. She is fond Jim!” “Now come point, Diamond. I see mean, exactly. I turn mind. Could bring Jim see me?” “I will try, sir. But do not mind much. They think I am silly,” added Diamond, one his sweetest smiles. What Mr. Raymond thought, I dare hardly attempt put here. But one part was, highest wisdom must ever appear folly possess it. “I think he would come though--after dark, know,” Diamond continued. “He well shining boots. People's kind lame boys, know, sir. But dark, are not much doing.” Diamond succeeded bringing Jim Mr. Raymond, consequence he resolved give boy chance. He provided new clothes Nanny; upon certain day, Joseph took his wife three children, Nanny Jim, train certain station county Kent, found cart waiting carry luggage The Mound, name Mr. Raymond's new residence. I describe varied feelings party went, arrived. All I say is, Diamond, care, full quiet delight--a gladness deep talk about. Joseph returned town night, next morning drove Ruby Diamond down, carriage behind them, Mr. Raymond lady carriage. For Mr. Raymond old bachelor longer: he bringing his wife live The Mound. The moment Nanny saw her, she recognised her lady lent her ruby-ring. That ring given her Mr. Raymond. The weather hot, woods shadowy. There great many wild flowers, getting well towards autumn, wild flowers rise early leaves, not, would never get glimpse sun them. So fun over, ready go bed time trees dressed. But plenty loveliest grass daisies house, Diamond's chief pleasure seemed lie amongst them, breathe pure air. But time, he dreaming country back north wind, trying recall songs river used sing. For like back north wind anything he known since he left it. Sometimes he would his little brother, sometimes his little sister, sometimes grass him, he felt like cat her first kittens, he said, he could not purr--all he could sing. These different times he used drive cab, must suppose Diamond idle. He much his mother now, Nanny occupied his former place; he helped his father still, stable harness-room, generally went box he might learn drive pair, ready open carriage-door. Mr. Raymond advised his father give plenty liberty. “A boy like that,” he said, “ought pushed.” Joseph assented heartily, smiling idea pushing Diamond. After everything fell his share, boy wealth time his disposal. And happy, sometimes merry time was. Only two months so, he neither saw heard anything North Wind. CHAPTER XXXV. I MAKE DIAMOND'S ACQUAINTANCE MR. RAYMOND'S house called The Mound, stood upon little steep knoll, smooth symmetrical showed artificial. It had, beyond doubt, built Queen Elizabeth hunting tower--a place, namely, top could see country miles sides, able follow eyes flying deer pursuing hounds horsemen. The mound cast give good basement-advantage neighbouring heights woods. There great quarry-hole far off, brim-full water, which, current legend stated, materials forming heart mound--a kind stone unfit building--had dug. The house brick, said foundations first laid natural level, stones earth mound heaped them, great height well buttressed. Joseph his wife lived little cottage short way house. It real cottage, roof thick thatch, which, June July, wind sprinkled red white petals shook loose topmost sprays rose-trees climbing walls. At first Diamond nest thatch--a pretty little room white muslin curtains, afterwards Mr. Mrs. Raymond wanted page house, his father mother quite pleased employed without his leaving them. So he dressed suit blue, his pale face fair hair came like loveliest blossom, took his abode house. “Would afraid sleep alone, Diamond?” asked his mistress. “I do not know mean, madam,” said Diamond. “I never afraid anything I recollect--not much, least.” “There is little room top house--all alone,” she returned; “perhaps would mind sleeping there?” “I sleep anywhere, I like best high up. Should I able see out?” “I show place,” she answered; taking hand, she led oval-winding stair one two towers. Near top entered tiny little room, two windows could see whole country. Diamond clapped his hands delight. “You would like room, then, Diamond?” said his mistress. “It is grandest room house,” he answered. “I shall near stars, yet far tops trees. That is I like.” I daresay he thought, also, would nice place North Wind call passing; he said nothing sort. Below spread lake green leaves, glimpses grass bottom it. As he looked down, he saw squirrel appear suddenly, suddenly vanish amongst topmost branches. “Aha! little squirrel,” he cried, “my nest built higher yours.” “You books much like,” said his mistress. “I little bell hung door, I ring I want you. Half-way stair drawing-room.” So Diamond installed page, his new room got ready him. It soon I came know Diamond. I tutor family whose estate adjoined little property belonging The Mound. I made acquaintance Mr. Raymond London time before, walking drive towards house call upon one fine warm evening, I saw Diamond first time. He sitting foot great beech-tree, yards road, book his knees. He see me. I walked behind tree, peeping his shoulder, saw he reading fairy-book. “What reading?” I said, spoke suddenly, hope seeing startled little face look round me. Diamond turned his head quietly he obeying his mother's voice, calmness his face rebuked unkind desire made ashamed it. “I reading story Little Lady Goblin Prince,” said Diamond. “I sorry I do not know story,” I returned. “Who by?” “Mr. Raymond made it.” “Is he uncle?” I asked guess. “No. He is master.” “What him?” I asked respectfully. “Anything he wishes do,” he answered. “I busy now. He gave story read. He wants opinion upon it.” “Do not find rather hard make mind?” “Oh dear no! Any story always tells I am think it. Mr. Raymond does not want say whether clever story not, whether I like it, I like it. I never tell call clever call silly, I always know whether I like story not.” “And always tell like not?” “No. Very often I cannot all. Sometimes I can. I always know, I cannot always tell why. Mr. Raymond writes stories, tries me. Mother she makes jam. She is made lot jam since came here! And she always makes taste see it will do. Mother knows face I make whether not.” At moment I caught sight two children approaching. One handsome girl, pale-faced, awkward-looking boy, limped much one leg. I withdrew little, see would follow, seemed consternation. After hurried words, went together, I pursued way house, I kindly received Mr. Mrs. Raymond I could desired. From I learned something Diamond, consequence glad find him, I returned, seated place before. “What boy girl want you, Diamond?” I asked. “They seen creature frightened them.” “And came tell it?” “They could not get water well it. So wanted go them.” “They are bigger you.” “Yes, frightened it.” “And were not frightened it?” “No.” “Why?” “Because I am silly. I am never frightened things.” I could help thinking old meaning word silly. “And it?” I asked. “I think kind angel--a little one. It long body great wings, drove fast grew thin cloud round it. It flew backwards forwards well, hung right middle, making mist wings, business take care water.” “And drive away?” “I did not drive away. I knew, whatever creature was, well get water of. So I took jug, dipped in, drew water.” “And creature do?” “Flew about.” “And did not hurt you?” “No. Why it? I was not anything wrong.” “What companions say then?” “They said--`Thank you, Diamond. What dear silly are!'” “And were not angry them?” “No! Why I? I like would play little; always like better go away together work over. They never heed me. I do not mind much, though. The creatures friendly. They do not run away me. Only they are busy work, do not mind much.” “Do feel lonely, then?” “Oh, no! When nobody minds me, I get nest, look up. And sky mind me, thinks me.” “Where nest?” He rose, saying, “I show you,” led side tree. There hung little rope-ladder one lower boughs. The boy climbed ladder got upon bough. Then he climbed farther leafy branches, went sight. After little while, I heard his voice coming tree. “I nest now,” said voice. “I cannot see you,” I returned. “I cannot see either, I see first star peeping sky. I like get sky. Do not think I shall, day?” “Yes, I do. Tell see there.” “I do not see anything more, except leaves, big sky me. It goes swinging about. The earth behind back. There comes another star! The wind like kisses big lady. When I get I feel I North Wind's arms.” This first I heard North Wind. The whole ways look child, full quiet wisdom, yet ready accept judgment others his dispraise, took hold heart, I felt wonderfully drawn towards him. It seemed me, somehow, little Diamond possessed secret life, he ready think lowest living thing--an angel God something special say do. A gush reverence came me, single goodnight, I turned left his nest. I saw often this, gained much his confidence he told I told you. I cannot pretend account it. I leave philosophical reader his fashion. The easiest way Nanny Jim, said often Diamond tile loose. But Mr. Raymond much opinion concerning boy; Mrs. Raymond confessed she often rang her bell pleasure seeing lovely stillness boy's face, blue eyes seemed rather made people look look of. It plainer others he felt desertion Nanny Jim. They appeared regard mere toy, except found he could minister scruple using him--generally success. They were, however, well-behaved wonderful degree; I little doubt much good behaviour owing unconscious influence boy called God's baby. One strange thing I could never find he got his many songs. At times would bubbles blown nursery rhyme, following, I heard sing one evening his little Dulcimer. There score sheep feeding paddock near him, white wool dyed pale rose light setting sun. Those long shadows trees dead white; sunlight half glorified pale rose. Little Bo Peep, she lost her sheep, And did not know find them; They height sight, Trailing tails behind them. Little Bo Peep woke her sleep, Jump'd set find them: “The silly things, they have got wings, And they have left trails behind them: “They have taken tails, they have left trails, And I shall follow find them;” For wherever tail dragged trail, The long grass grew behind them. And day's eyes butter-cups, cow's lips crow's feet Were glittering sun. She threw her book, caught her crook, And her sheep run. She ran, she ran, ever she ran, The grass grew higher higher; Till hill sun began To set flame fire. She ran still--up grassy hill, And grass grew higher higher; When she reached crown, sun down, And left trail fire. The sheep tails gone, gone-- And trail behind them! Yes, yes! there--long-tailed fair, But, alas! she could find them. Purple gold, rosy blue, With tails white behind them, Her sheep run trail sun; She saw them, could find them. After sun, like clouds run, But she knew her sheep: She sat cry, look sky, But she cried herself asleep. And she slept dew fell fast, And wind blew sky; And strange things took place shun day's face, Because sweet shy. Nibble, nibble, crop! she heard she woke: A hundred little lambs Did pluck eat grass sweet That grew trails dams. Little Bo Peep caught her crook, And wiped tears blind her. And nibble, nibble crop! without stop! The lambs came eating behind her. Home, home she came, tired lame, With three times many sheep. In month more, they will big before, And she will laugh her sleep. But would say, one fine day, When they have got bushiest tails, Their grown game same, And she follow trails? Never weep, Bo Peep, though lose sheep, And know find them; It Is sun mothers run, And lambs behind them. I confess touched little, loses far Diamond's sweet voice singing gains rhyme there. Some books Mr. Raymond given him. These he always knew, others he could seldom tell. Sometimes he would say, “I made one.” generally he would say, “I do not know; I found somewhere;” “I got back north wind.” One evening I found sitting grassy slope house, his Dulcimer his arms his little brother rolling grass beside them. He chanting his usual way, like sound brook anything else I think of. When I went he ceased his chant. “Do go on, Diamond. Do not mind me,” I said. He began once. While he sang, Nanny Jim sat little way off, one hemming pocket-handkerchief, reading story her, never heeded Diamond. This near he sang I recollect, reproduce rather. What would see I took To little nest air? You would see sky like clear blue cup Turned upside downwards there. What would I took To little nest tree? My child cries would trouble air, To get she could see. What would get top tree For crying grief? Not star would clutch see-- You could gather leaf. But lost greedy grief, Content see afar, You would find hand withering leaf, In heart shining star. As Diamond went singing, grew dark, he ceased came great flash lightning, blinded us moment. Dulcimer crowed pleasure; roar thunder came it, little brother gave loud cry terror. Nanny Jim came running us, pale fear. Diamond's face, too, paler usual, delight. Some glory seemed clung it, remained shining. “You are frightened--are you, Diamond?” I said. “No. Why I be?” he answered his usual question, looking face calm shining eyes. “He are not got sense frightened,” said Nanny, going giving pitying hug. “Perhaps there is sense frightened, Nanny,” I returned. “Do think lightning likes?” “It might kill you,” said Jim. “Oh, no, might not!” said Diamond. As he spoke came another great flash, tearing crack. “There is tree struck!” I said; looked round, blinding flash left eyes, saw huge bough beech-tree Diamond's nest hanging ground like broken wing bird. “There!” cried Nanny; “I told so. If see would happened, little silly!” “No, I do not,” said Diamond, began sing Dulcimer. All I could hear song, children going chatter, was-- The clock struck one, And mouse came down. Dickery, dickery, dock! Then came blast wind, rain followed straight-pouring lines, watering-pot. Diamond jumped his little Dulcimer his arms, Nanny caught little boy, ran cottage. Jim vanished double shuffle, I went house. When I came return home, clouds gone, evening sky glimmered trees, blue, pale-green towards west, I turned steps little aside look stricken beech. I saw bough torn stem, twilight would allow see. While I stood gazing, sky came sound singing, voice neither lark nightingale: sweeter either: voice Diamond, his airy nest:-- The lightning thunder, They go come; But stars stillness Are always home. And voice ceased. “Good-night, Diamond,” I said. “Good-night, sir,” answered Diamond. As I walked away pondering, I saw great black top beech swaying sky upper wind, heard murmur many dim half-articulate voices filling solitude around Diamond's nest. CHAPTER XXXVI. DIAMOND QUESTIONS NORTH WIND MY READERS wonder that, this, I best gain friendship Diamond. Nor I find difficult, child ready trust. Upon one subject alone he reticent--the story his relations North Wind. I fancy he could quite make his mind think them. At events little time he trusted this, he told everything. If I could regard exactly light he did, I was, guiltless least pretence, fully sympathetic, he satisfied without demanding theory difficult points involved. I let see plainly enough, whatever might explanation marvellous experience, I would given much similar one myself. On evening soon thunderstorm, late twilight, half-moon high heavens, I came upon Diamond act climbing his little ladder beech-tree. “What always going for, Diamond?” I heard Nanny ask, rather rudely, I thought. “Sometimes one thing, sometimes another, Nanny,” answered Diamond, looking skywards he climbed. “You will break neck day,” she said. “I am going look moon to-night,” he added, without heeding her remark. “You will see moon well here,” she returned. “I do not think so.” “You will nearer her there.” “Oh, yes! I shall. I must nearer her, know. I wish I could dream pretty dreams her can, Nanny.” “You silly! never done dream. I never dreamed one, nonsense enough, I am sure.” “It was not nonsense. It beautiful dream--and funny one too, one.” “But what is good talking way, know dream? Dreams are not true.” “That one true, Nanny. You know was. Did not come grief told do? And is not true?” “I cannot get sense him,” exclaimed Nanny, expression mild despair. “Do really believe, Diamond, there is house moon, beautiful lady crooked old man dusters it?” “If is not, there is something better,” he answered, vanished leaves heads. I went house, I visited often evenings. When I came out, little wind blowing, pleasant heat day, although late summer now, still hot. The tree-tops swinging it. I took way past beech, called see Diamond still his nest rocking head. “Are there, Diamond?” I said. “Yes, sir,” came his clear voice reply. “Is not growing dark get safely?” “Oh, no, sir--if I take time it. I know way well, never let go one hand till I have good hold other.” “Do careful,” I insisted--foolishly, seeing boy careful he could already. “I am coming,” he returned. “I have got moon I want to-night.” I heard rustling rustling drawing nearer nearer. Three four minutes elapsed, he appeared length creeping his little ladder. I took arms, set ground. “Thank you, sir,” he said. “That is north wind blowing, is not it, sir?” “I cannot tell,” I answered. “It feels cool kind, I think may be. But I could not sure except stronger, gentle wind might turn way amongst trunks trees.” “I shall know I get room,” said Diamond. “I think I hear mistress's bell. Good-night, sir.” He ran house, I went home. His mistress rung send bed, she careful I daresay thought he looking well. When he reached his room, he opened his windows, one looked north east, find wind blew. It blew right northern window. Diamond glad, he thought perhaps North Wind herself would come now: real north wind never blown time since he left London. But, she always came herself, never he looking her, indeed almost never he thinking her, he shut east window, went bed. Perhaps readers may wonder he could go sleep expectation; and, indeed, I known him, I wondered myself; one his peculiarities, seemed nothing strange him. He full quietness he could go sleep almost time, he composed let sleep come. This time he went fast asleep usual. But he woke dim blue night. The moon vanished. He thought he heard knocking his door. “Somebody wants me,” he said himself, jumping bed, ran open it. But one there. He closed again, and, noise still continuing, found another door room rattling. It belonged closet, he thought, he never able open it. The wind blowing window must shaking it. He would go see so. The door opened quite easily, his surprise, instead closet he found long narrow room. The moon, sinking west, shone open window end. The room low coved ceiling, occupied whole top house, immediately roof. It quite empty. The yellow light half-moon streamed dark floor. He delighted discovery strange, desolate, moonlit place close his snug little room, he began dance skip floor. The wind came door he left open, blew he danced, he kept turning towards might blow his face. He kept picturing many places, lovely desolate, hill-sides farm-yards tree-tops meadows, blown way The Mound. And he danced, he grew delighted motion wind; his feet grew stronger, his body lighter, length seemed he borne air, could almost fly. So strong his feeling become, last he began doubt whether he one precious dreams he often had, he floated air will. But something made look up, his unspeakable delight, he found his uplifted hands lying North Wind, dancing him, round round long bare room, her hair falling floor, filling arched ceiling, her eyes shining like thinking stars, sweetest grand smiles playing breezily her beautiful mouth. She was, often before, height rather tall lady. She stoop order dance him, held his hands high hers. When he saw her, he gave one spring, his arms her neck, her arms holding her bosom. The moment she swept open window moon shining, made circuit like bird alight, settled his nest top great beech-tree. There she placed her lap began hush he her baby, Diamond entirely happy he care speak word. At length, however, he found he going sleep, would lose much, that, pleasant was, he could consent. “Please, dear North Wind,” he said, “I happy I am afraid it is dream. How I know it is dream?” “What matter?” returned North Wind. “I should, cry” said Diamond. “But cry? The dream, dream, pleasant one--is not?” “That is I want true.” “Have forgotten said Nanny her dream?” “It is dream itself--I mean, it is pleasure it,” answered Diamond, “for I that, whether dream not; it is you, North Wind; I cannot bear find dream, I lose you. You would nobody then, I could bear that. You are not dream, you, dear North Wind? Do say No, else I shall cry, come awake, you will gone ever. I dare not dream are not anybody.” “I am either dream, there is something better that is dream, Diamond,” said North Wind, rather sorrowful tone, he thought. “But it is something better--it is I want, North Wind,” he persisted, already beginning cry little. She made answer, rose her arms sailed away tree-tops till came meadow, flock sheep feeding. “Do remember song singing week ago says Bo-Peep--how she lost her sheep, got twice many lambs?” asked North Wind, sitting grass, placing her lap before. “Oh yes, I do, well enough,” answered Diamond; “but I never quite liked rhyme.” “Why not, child?” “Because seems say one's good another, two new ones better one that is lost. I have thinking great deal, seems although one sixpence good sixpence, twenty lambs would instead one sheep whose face knew. Somehow, you have looked anybody's eyes, right deep them, I mean, nobody one more. Nobody, ever beautiful good, make one going sight. So see, North Wind, I cannot help frightened think perhaps I dreaming, nowhere all. Do tell own, real, beautiful North Wind.” Again she rose, shot herself air, uneasy she could answer him; Diamond lay quiet her arms, waiting she would say. He tried see her face, he dreadfully afraid she answering she could say she dream; she let her hair fall her face he could see it. This frightened still more. “Do speak, North Wind,” he said last. “I never speak I nothing say,” she replied. “Then I think must real North Wind, dream,” said Diamond. “But I am looking something say time.” “But I do not want say what is hard find. If say one word comfort was not true, I know must dream, great beautiful lady like could never tell lie.” “But she might not know say she say, little boy like would understand it,” said North Wind. “Here, let us get again, I try tell I think. You musn't suppose I able answer questions, though. There great many things I do not understand do.” She descended grassy hillock, midst wild furzy common. There rabbit-warren underneath, rabbits came holes, moonlight, looking sober wise, like patriarchs standing tent-doors, looking going bed. When saw North Wind, instead turning round vanishing thump heels, cantered slowly her snuffled her long upper lips, moved every way once. That way kissing her; and, she talked Diamond, she would every stroke furry backs, lift play long ears. They would, Diamond thought, leaped upon her lap, he already. “I think,” said she, sitting silent while, “that I dream, would able love so. You love me, do not you?” “Indeed I do,” answered Diamond, stroking her hand. “I see! I see! How could I able love I were not all, know? Besides, I could not able dream anything half beautiful head; I did, I could not love fancy like that, could I?” “I think not. You might loved dream, dreamily, forgotten woke, I daresay, loved like real love me. Even then, I do not think could dream anything had not something real like somewhere. But you have seen many shapes, Diamond: remember I wolf once--do not you?” “Oh yes--a good wolf frightened naughty drunken nurse.” “Well, suppose I turn ugly, would rather I were not dream then?” “Yes; I know beautiful inside same. You would love me, I love same. I should not like look ugly, know. But I should not believe bit.” “Not saw it?” “No, I saw ever plain.” “There is Diamond! I tell I know then. I do not think I fancy be. I shape various ways various people. But heart true. People call dreadful names, think know me. But do not. Sometimes call Bad Fortune, sometimes Evil Chance, sometimes Ruin; another name think dreadful all.” “What that?” asked Diamond, smiling her face. “I will not tell name. Do remember go get country back?” “Oh yes, I do. How cold were, North Wind! white, lovely eyes! My heart grew like lump ice, I forgot while.” “You near knowing call then. Would afraid go again?” “No. Why I? Indeed I glad enough, get another peep country back.” “You have never seen yet.” “Have not I, North Wind? Oh! I am sorry! I thought I had. What I see then?” “Only picture it. The real country real back ever much beautiful that. You shall see one day--perhaps long.” “Do sing songs there?” “Do not remember dream little boys dug stars?” “Yes, I do. I thought must something dream, beautiful.” “Yes; I gave dream.” “Oh! thank you. Did give Nanny her dream too--about moon bees?” “Yes. I lady sat window moon.” “Oh, thank you. I almost sure something too. And tell Mr. Raymond story Princess Daylight?” “I believe I something it. At events he thought one night he could not sleep. But I want ask whether remember song boy-angels sang dream yours.” “No. I could not keep it, I would, I try.” “That fault.” “How could be, North Wind?” “Because I did not know properly myself, I could not teach you. I could make rough guess something like would be, I was not able make dream hard enough remember it. Nor would I done I could, correct. I made dream pictures it, though. But hear song get back of----” “My dear North Wind,” said Diamond, finishing sentence her, kissing arm held leaning her. “And we have settled this--for time, least,” said North Wind. “But I cannot feel quite sure yet,” said Diamond. “You must wait that. Meantime may hopeful, content quite sure. Come now, I take home again, will not tire much.” “Oh, no, no. I am least tired,” pleaded Diamond. “It better, though.” “Very well; wish it,” yielded Diamond sigh. “You dear good, boy” said North Wind. “I come to-morrow night take longer time. We shall make little journey together, fact, shall start earlier, moon later, shall little moonlight way.” She rose, swept meadow trees. In moments Mound appeared them. She sank little, floated window Diamond's room. There she laid his bed, covered over, moment he lapt dreamless sleep. CHAPTER XXXVII. ONCE MORE THE next night Diamond seated his open window, his head his hand, rather tired, eagerly waiting promised visit he afraid he could sleep. But he started suddenly, found he already asleep. He rose, looking window saw something white his beech-tree. It North Wind. She holding one hand top branch. Her hair her garments went floating away behind her tree, whose top swaying others still. “Are ready, Diamond?” she asked. “Yes,” answered Diamond, “quite ready.” In moment she window, her arms came took him. She sailed away swiftly he could first mark nothing speed clouds dim earth went rushing past. But soon he began see sky lovely, mottled clouds moon, she threw faint colours like mother-of-pearl, opal. The night warm, lady's arms he feel wind making waves ripe corn, ripples rivers lakes. At length descended side open earthy hill, where, beneath stone, spring came bubbling out. “I going take along little brook,” said North Wind. “I wanted anything else to-night, I give treat.” She stooped stream holding Diamond close surface it, glided along level flow ran hill. And song brook came Diamond's ears, grew grew changed every turn. It seemed Diamond singing story life him. And was. It began musical tinkle changed babble gentle rushing. Sometimes song would almost cease, break again, tinkle, babble, rush, once. At bottom hill came small river, brook flowed muffled merry sound. Along surface river, darkly clear moonlight, floated; now, widened little lake, would hover moment bed water-lilies, watch swing about, folded sleep, water leaned swayed presence North Wind; would watch fishes asleep among roots below. Sometimes she would hold Diamond deep hollow curving bank, he might look far cool stillness. Sometimes she would leave river sweep across clover-field. The bees home, clover asleep. Then she would return follow river. It grew wider wider went. Now armies wheat oats would hang rush opposite banks; willows would dip low branches still waters; would lead stately trees grassy banks lovely garden, roses lilies asleep, tender flowers quite folded up, wide-awake sending life sweet, strong odours. Wider wider grew stream, came upon boats lying along banks, rocked little flutter North Wind's garments. Then came houses banks, standing lovely lawn, grand trees; parts river high grass roots trees water, Diamond, glided stems, could see grass bottom water. Then would leave river float houses, one another--beautiful rich houses, which, like fine trees, taken centuries grow. There scarcely light seen, movement heard: people lay fast asleep. “What lot dreams must dreaming!” said Diamond. “Yes,” returned North Wind. “They cannot surely lies--can they?” “I think depends little dreams them,” suggested Diamond. “Yes,” said North Wind. “The people think lies, lies, likely dream lies. But people love true surely dream true things. But something depends whether dreams home-grown, whether seed blown somebody else's garden-wall. Ah! there is one awake house!” They floating past window light burning. Diamond heard moan, looked anxiously North Wind's face. “It is lady,” said North Wind. “She cannot sleep pain.” “Could not something her?” said Diamond. “No, I cannot. But could.” “What could I do?” “Sing little song her.” “She would not hear me.” “I take in, she hear you.” “But would rude, would not it? You go please, course, I business her room.” “You may trust me, Diamond. I shall take good care lady you. The window open. Come.” By shaded lamp, lady seated white wrapper, trying read, moaning every minute. North Wind floated behind her chair, set Diamond down, told sing something. He little frightened, he thought while, sang:-- The sun gone down, And moon's sky; But sun come up, And moon laid by. The flower asleep But dead; When morning shines, It lift head. When winter comes, It die--no, no; It hide From frost snow. Sure summer, Sure sun; The night winter Are shadows run. The lady never lifted her eyes her book, her head her hand. As soon Diamond finished, North Wind lifted carried away. “Did not lady hear me?” asked Diamond floating river. “Oh, yes, she heard you,” answered North Wind. “Was she frightened then?” “Oh, no.” “Why did not she look see was?” “She did not know there.” “How could she hear then?” “She did not hear her ears.” “What she hear with?” “With her heart.” “Where she think words came from?” “She thought came book she reading. She search to-morrow find them, will not able understand all.” “Oh, fun!” said Diamond. “What she do?” “I tell she will not do: she will never forget meaning them; she will never able remember words them.” “If she sees Mr. Raymond's book, puzzle her, will not it?” “Yes, will. She never able understand it.” “Until she gets back north wind,” suggested Diamond. “Until she gets back north wind,” assented lady. “Oh!” cried Diamond, “I know are. Oh! let go old garden, mother's room, Diamond's stall. I wonder hole back bed still. I like stay rest night. It will not take long get home here, it, North Wind?” “No,” she answered; “you shall stay long like.” “Oh, jolly,” cried Diamond, North Wind sailed house him, set lawn back. Diamond ran lawn little moonlight. He found part cut flower-beds, little summer-house coloured glass great elm-tree gone. He like this, ran stable. There horses all. He ran upstairs. The rooms empty. The thing left he cared hole wall his little bed stood; enough make wish stop. He ran stair again, upon lawn. There he threw began cry. It dreary lost! “I thought I liked place much,” said Diamond himself, “but I find I do not care it. I suppose it is people make like place, they are gone, it is dead, do not care bit it. North Wind told I might stop long I liked, I have stopped longer already. North Wind!” he cried aloud, turning his face towards sky. The moon cloud, looking dull dismal. A star shot sky, fell grass beside him. The moment lighted, stood North Wind. “Oh!” cried Diamond, joyfully, “were shooting star?” “Yes, child.” “Did hear call then?” “Yes.” “So high that?” “Yes; I heard quite well.” “Do take home.” “Have enough old home already?” “Yes, enough. It is not home now.” “I thought would it,” said North Wind. “Everything, dreaming all, got soul it, else it is worth nothing, do not care bit it. Some thoughts worth nothing, they have got soul them. The brain puts mind, mind brain.” “But know that, North Wind? You have not got body.” “If I had not would not know anything me. No creature know another without help body. But I do not care talk that. It time go home.” So saying, North Wind lifted Diamond bore away. CHAPTER XXXVIII. AT THE BACK OF THE NORTH WIND I DID see Diamond week this, he told I told you. I astonished his able even report conversations he said he North Wind, I known already children profound metaphysics. But fear crosses me, lest, telling much friend, I lead people mistake one consequential, priggish little monsters, always trying say clever things, looking see whether people appreciate them. When child like dies, instead silly book written him, he stuffed like one awful big-headed fishes see museums. But Diamond never troubled his head people thought him. He never set knowing better others. The wisest things he said came he wanted one help difficulty he in. He even offended Nanny Jim calling silly. He supposed something it, though he could quite understand what. I suspect however name gave him, God's Baby, share reconciling it. Happily me, I much interested metaphysics Diamond himself, therefore, he recounted his conversations North Wind, I find strange sea, although certainly I could always feel bottom, indeed convinced bottom miles away. “Could dreaming, think, sir?” he asked anxiously. “I dare not say, Diamond,” I answered. “But least one thing may sure of, still better love wonderful call North Wind. Even she dream, dream beautiful creature could come chance.” “Yes, I know,” returned Diamond; “I know.” Then he silent, but, I confess, appeared thoughtful satisfied. The next time I saw him, he looked paler usual. “Have seen friend again?” I asked him. “Yes,” he answered, solemnly. “Did she take her?” “No. She speak me. I woke once, I generally I going see her, she door big room, sitting I saw her sit her doorstep, white snow, her eyes blue heart iceberg. She looked me, never moved spoke.” “Were not afraid?” I asked. “No. Why I been?” he answered. “I felt little cold.” “Did she stay long?” “I do not know. I fell asleep again. I think I rather cold ever since though,” he added smile. I quite like this, I said nothing. Four days after, I called Mound. The maid opened door looked grave, I suspected nothing. When I reached drawing-room, I saw Mrs. Raymond crying. “Have not heard?” she said, seeing questioning looks. “I have heard nothing,” I answered. “This morning found dear little Diamond lying floor big attic-room, outside his door--fast asleep, thought. But took up, think he asleep. We saw that----” Here kind-hearted lady broke crying afresh. “May I go see him?” I asked. “Yes,” she sobbed. “You know way top tower.” I walked winding stair, entered his room. A lovely figure, white almost clear alabaster, lying bed. I saw was. They thought he dead. I knew he gone back north wind.
