 THE CORAL ISLAND Chapter I The beginning--My early life character--I thirst adventure foreign lands, go sea. Roving always been, still is, ruling passion, joy heart, sunshine existence. In childhood, boyhood, man's estate, I rover; mere rambler among woody glens upon hilltops native land, enthusiastic rover throughout length breadth wide, wide world. It wild, black night howling storm, night I born foaming bosom broad Atlantic Ocean. My father sea-captain; grandfather sea-captain; great-grandfather marine. Nobody could tell positively occupation _his_ father followed; dear mother used assert he midshipman, whose grandfather, mother's side, admiral Royal Navy. At rate, knew that, far back family could traced, intimately connected great watery waste. Indeed, case sides house; mother always went sea father his long voyages, spent greater part her life upon water. Thus was, I suppose, I came inherit roving disposition. Soon I born, father, old, retired seafaring life, purchased small cottage fishing village west coast England, settled spend evening his life shores sea many years his home. It long I began show roving spirit dwelt within me. For time past infant legs gaining strength, I came dissatisfied rubbing skin chubby knees walking them, made many attempts stand walk like man, attempts, however, resulted sitting violently sudden surprise. One day I took advantage dear mother's absence make another effort; and, joy, I actually succeeded reaching doorstep, I tumbled pool muddy water lay father's cottage door. Ah, vividly I remember horror poor mother she found sweltering mud amongst group cackling ducks, tenderness she stripped dripping clothes washed dirty little body! From time forth rambles became frequent, and, I grew older, distant, last I wandered far near shore woods around humble dwelling, rest content father bound apprentice coasting vessel, let go sea. For years I happy visiting seaports, coasting along shores native land. My Christian name Ralph, comrades added name Rover, consequence passion I always evinced travelling. Rover real name, I never received other, I came last answer naturally proper name; bad one, I see good reason I introduce reader Ralph Rover. My shipmates kind, good-natured fellows, I got well together. They did, indeed, frequently make game banter me, unkindly; I overheard sometimes saying Ralph Rover "queer, old-fashioned fellow." This, I must confess, surprised much, I pondered saying long, could come satisfactory conclusion wherein old-fashionedness lay. It true I quiet lad, seldom spoke except spoken to. Moreover, I never could understand jokes companions, even explained me: dulness apprehension occasioned much grief. However, I tried make smiling looking pleased I observed laughing witticism I failed detect. I also fond inquiring nature things causes, often fell fits abstraction thus engaged mind. But I saw nothing seem exceedingly natural, could means understand comrades call "an old-fashioned fellow." Now, engaged coasting trade, I fell many seamen travelled almost every quarter globe; I freely confess heart glowed ardently within recounted wild adventures foreign lands--the dreadful storms weathered, appalling dangers escaped, wonderful creatures seen land sea, interesting lands strange people visited. But places told me, none captivated charmed imagination much Coral Islands Southern Seas. They told thousands beautiful, fertile islands formed small creature called coral insect, summer reigned nearly year round; trees laden constant harvest luxuriant fruit; climate almost perpetually delightful; yet where, strange say, men wild, bloodthirsty savages, excepting favoured isles Gospel Saviour conveyed. These exciting accounts great effect upon mind that, I reached age fifteen, I resolved make voyage South Seas. I little difficulty first prevailing dear parents let go; I urged father he would never become great captain he remained coasting trade, he saw truth I said, gave his consent. My dear mother, seeing father made his mind, longer offered opposition wishes. "But oh, Ralph," she said, day I bade her adieu, "come back soon us, dear boy, getting old now, Ralph, may many years live." I take readers' time minute account occurred I took final leave dear parents. Suffice say father placed charge old messmate his own, merchant captain, point sailing South Seas his ship, _Arrow_. My mother gave her blessing small Bible; her last request I would never forget read chapter every day, say prayers; I promised, tears eyes, I would certainly do. Soon afterwards, I went board _Arrow_, fine large ship, set sail islands Pacific Ocean. Chapter II The departure--The sea--My companions--Some account wonderful sights saw great deep--A dreadful storm frightful wreck. It bright, beautiful, warm day ship spread her canvas breeze, sailed regions south. Oh, heart bounded delight I listened merry chorus sailors, hauled ropes got anchor! The captain shouted; men ran obey; noble ship bent breeze, shore gradually faded view, I stood looking kind feeling whole delightful dream. The first thing struck different anything I yet seen short career sea, hoisting anchor deck lashing firmly ropes, bid adieu land ever, would require services more. "There, lass," cried broad-shouldered jack-tar, giving fluke anchor hearty slap his hand housing completed--"there, lass, take good nap now, shall not ask kiss mud many long day come!" And was. That anchor "kiss mud" many long days afterwards; last did, last time! There number boys ship, two special favourites. Jack Martin tall, strapping, broad-shouldered youth eighteen, handsome, good-humoured, firm face. He good education, clever hearty lion-like his actions, mild quiet disposition. Jack general favourite, peculiar fondness me. My companion Peterkin Gay. He little, quick, funny, decidedly mischievous, fourteen years old. But Peterkin's mischief almost always harmless, else he could much beloved he was. "Hallo, youngster!" cried Jack Martin, giving slap shoulder day I joined ship, "come below, I will show berth. You I messmates, I think shall good friends, I like look you." Jack right. He I, Peterkin afterwards, became best staunchest friends ever tossed together stormy waves. I shall say little first part voyage. We usual amount rough weather calm; also saw many strange fish rolling sea, I greatly delighted one day seeing shoal flying-fish dart water skim air foot surface. They pursued dolphins, feed them, one flying-fish terror flew ship, struck rigging, fell upon deck. Its wings fins elongated, found could never fly far time, never mounted air like birds, skimmed along surface sea. Jack I dinner, found remarkably good. When approached Cape Horn, southern extremity America, weather became cold stormy, sailors began tell stories furious gales dangers terrible Cape. "Cape Horn," said one, "is horrible headland I ever doubled. I have sailed round twice already, times ship a'most blow'd water." "I have round once," said another, "an' time sails split, ropes frozen blocks, would not work, wos lost." "An' I have round five times," cried third, "an' every time wos wuss another, gales wos tree-mendous!" "And I have round times all," cried Peterkin, impudent wink his eye, "an' _that_ time I wos blow'd inside out!" Nevertheless, passed dreaded Cape without much rough weather, and, course weeks afterwards, sailing gently warm, tropical breeze Pacific Ocean. Thus proceeded voyage, sometimes bounding merrily fair breeze, times floating calmly glassy wave fishing curious inhabitants deep--all which, although sailors thought little them, strange, interesting, wonderful me. At last came among Coral Islands Pacific, I shall never forget delight I gazed--when chanced pass one--at pure, white, dazzling shores, verdant palm trees, looked bright beautiful sunshine. And often three long landed one, imagining certainly find perfect happiness there! Our wish granted sooner expected. One night, soon entered tropics, awful storm burst upon ship. The first squall wind carried away two masts, left foremast standing. Even this, however, enough, dare hoist rag sail it. For five days tempest raged fury. Everything swept decks except one small boat. The steersman lashed wheel, lest he washed away, gave lost. The captain said he idea were, blown far course; feared much might get among dangerous coral reefs numerous Pacific. At daybreak sixth morning gale saw land ahead. It island encircled reef coral waves broke fury. There calm water within reef, could see one narrow opening it. For opening steered, ere reached tremendous wave broke stern, tore rudder completely off, left us mercy winds waves. "It is us now, lads!" said captain men. "Get boat ready launch; shall rocks less half-an-hour." The men obeyed gloomy silence, felt little hope small boat living sea. "Come, boys," said Jack Martin, grave tone, Peterkin, stood quarter-deck awaiting fate--"come, boys; three shall stick together. You see impossible little boat reach shore, crowded men. It sure upset, I mean rather trust large oar. I see telescope ship strike tail reef, waves break quiet water inside; so, manage cling oar till driven breakers, may perhaps gain shore. What say you? join me?" We gladly agreed follow Jack, he inspired us confidence, although I could perceive, sad tone his voice, he little hope; and, indeed, I looked white waves lashed reef boiled rocks fury, I felt step us death. My heart sank within me; moment thoughts turned beloved mother, I remembered words, among last she said me: "Ralph, dearest child, always remember hour danger look Lord Saviour Jesus Christ. He alone able willing save body soul." So I felt much comforted I thought thereon. The ship near rocks. The men ready boat, captain beside giving orders, tremendous wave came towards us. We three ran towards bow lay hold oar, barely reached wave fell deck crash like thunder. At moment ship struck, foremast broke close deck went side, carrying boat men along it. Our oar got entangled wreck, Jack seized axe cut free, but, owing motion ship, he missed cordage struck axe deep oar. Another wave, however, washed clear wreck. We seized hold it, next instant struggling wild sea. The last thing I saw boat whirling surf, sailors tossed foaming waves. Then I became insensible. On recovering swoon, I found lying bank soft grass, shelter overhanging rock, Peterkin his knees side, tenderly bathing temples water, endeavouring stop blood flowed wound forehead. Chapter III The Coral Island--Our first cogitations landing, result them--We conclude island uninhabited. There strange peculiar sensation experienced recovering state insensibility, almost indescribable: sort dreamy, confused consciousness; half-waking, half-sleeping condition, accompanied feeling weariness, which, however, means disagreeable. As I slowly recovered, heard voice Peterkin inquiring whether I felt better, I thought I must overslept myself, sent mast-head lazy; I could leap haste, thought seemed vanish suddenly away, I fancied I must ill. Then balmy breeze fanned cheek, I thought home, garden back father's cottage, luxuriant flowers, sweet-scented honeysuckle dear mother trained carefully upon trellised porch. But roaring surf put delightful thoughts flight, I back sea, watching dolphins flying-fish, reefing topsails wild stormy Cape Horn. Gradually roar surf became louder distinct. I thought wrecked far, far away native land, slowly opened eyes meet companion Jack, who, look intense anxiety, gazing face. "Speak us, dear Ralph," whispered Jack tenderly. "Are better now?" I smiled, looked up, saying, "Better! why, mean, Jack? I am quite well." "Then shamming for, frightening us way?" said Peterkin, smiling his tears; poor boy really impression I dying. I raised elbow, putting hand forehead, found cut pretty severely, I lost good deal blood. "Come, come, Ralph," said Jack, pressing gently backward, "lie down, boy; you are right yet. Wet lips water; it is cool clear crystal. I got spring close hand. There now, do not say word, hold tongue," he said, seeing speak. "I will tell it, must utter syllable till rested well." "Oh! do not stop speaking, Jack," said Peterkin, who, his fears safety removed, busied erecting shelter broken branches order protect wind, which, however, almost unnecessary, rock beside I laid completely broke force gale. "Let speak, Jack; it is comfort hear he is alive, lying stiff white sulky whole hour, like Egyptian mummy. Never saw fellow are, Ralph, always mischief. You have almost knocked teeth, half choked me, go shamming dead! It is wicked you, indeed is." While Peterkin ran style, faculties became quite clear again, I began understand position. "What mean saying I half choked you, Peterkin?" said I. "What I mean? Is English mother-tongue, want repeat French, way making clearer? Do not remember----" "I remember nothing," said I, interrupting him, "after thrown sea." "Hush, Peterkin!" said Jack; "you are exciting Ralph nonsense.--I will explain you. You recollect ship struck, three sprang bow sea: well, I noticed oar struck head gave cut brow, nearly stunned you, grasped Peterkin round neck without knowing apparently about. In pushed telescope--which clung life--against Peterkin's mouth----" "Pushed his mouth!" interrupted Peterkin; "say, crammed his throat. Why, there is distinct mark brass rim back gullet moment!" "Well, well, may," continued Jack, "you clung him, Ralph, till I feared really would choke him; I saw he good hold oar, I exerted utmost push towards shore, luckily reached without much trouble, water inside reef quite calm." "But captain crew, them?" I inquired anxiously. Jack shook his head. "Are lost?" "No, lost, I hope, I fear much chance saved. The ship struck tail island cast. When boat tossed sea fortunately upset, although shipped good deal water, men managed scramble it; could get oars gale carried past point away leeward island. After landed I saw endeavouring pull towards us; one pair oars eight belong boat, wind blowing right teeth, gradually lost ground. Then I saw put hoist sort sail--a blanket, I fancy, small boat--and half-an-hour sight." "Poor fellows!" I murmured sorrowfully. "But I think it, I have better hope them," continued Jack, cheerful tone. "You see, Ralph, I have read great deal South Sea Islands, I know many places scattered thousands sea, they are almost sure fall one long." "I am sure I hope so," said Peterkin earnestly. "But become wreck, Jack? I saw clambering rocks I watching Ralph. Did say she gone pieces?" "No, she gone pieces, she gone bottom," replied Jack. "As I said before, she struck tail island stove her bow, next breaker swung her clear, she floated away leeward. The poor fellows boat made hard struggle reach her, long came near her she filled went down. It she foundered I saw trying pull island." There long silence Jack ceased speaking, I doubt revolving his mind extraordinary position. For part, I cannot say reflections agreeable. I knew island, Jack said so, whether inhabited I know. If inhabited, I felt certain, I heard South Sea Islanders, roasted alive eaten. If turn uninhabited, I fancied starved death. "Oh," thought I, "if ship struck rocks might done pretty well, could obtained provisions her, tools enable us build shelter; now--alas! alas! lost!" These last words I uttered aloud distress. "Lost! Ralph?" exclaimed Jack, smile overspread his hearty countenance. "Saved, said. Your cogitations seem taken wrong road, led wrong conclusion." "Do know conclusion _I_ come to?" said Peterkin. "I made mind it is capital--first-rate--the best thing ever happened us, splendid prospect ever lay three jolly young tars. We have got island ourselves. We will take possession name king; we will go enter service black inhabitants. Of course we will rise, naturally, top affairs. White men always savage countries. You shall king, Jack; Ralph, prime minister; I shall be----" "The court-jester," interrupted Jack. "No," retorted Peterkin; "I will title all. I shall merely accept highly responsible situation government; see, Jack, I am fond enormous salary nothing do." "But suppose natives?" "Then we will build charming villa, plant lovely garden round it, stuck full splendiferous tropical flowers, we will farm land, plant, sow, reap, eat, sleep, merry." "But serious," said Jack, assuming grave expression countenance, I observed always effect checking Peterkin's disposition make fun everything, "we really rather uncomfortable position. If desert island, shall live much like wild beasts, tool kind, even knife." "Yes, _that_," said Peterkin, fumbling his trousers pocket, he drew forth small penknife one blade, broken. "Well, that is better nothing. But come," said Jack, rising; "we wasting time _talking_ instead _doing_.--You seem well enough walk now, Ralph. Let us see got pockets, let us climb hill ascertain sort island cast upon, for, whether good bad, seems likely home time come." Chapter IV We examine personal property, make happy discovery--Our island described--Jack proves learned sagacious his fellows--Curious discoveries--Natural lemonade! We seated upon rock, began examine personal property. When reached shore, wrecked, companions taken part clothes spread sun dry; although gale raging fiercely, single cloud bright sky. They also stripped part wet clothes spread also rocks. Having resumed garments, searched pockets utmost care, laid contents flat stone us; minds fully alive condition, little anxiety turned several pockets inside out, order nothing might escape us. When collected together, found worldly goods consisted following articles:-- First, small penknife single blade broken middle rusty, besides two three notches edge. (Peterkin said this, his usual pleasantry, would saw well knife, great advantage.) Second, old German-silver pencil-case without lead it. Third, piece whipcord six yards long. Fourth, sailmaker's needle small size. Fifth, ship's telescope, I happened hand time ship struck, I clung firmly time I water. Indeed difficulty Jack got grasp I lying insensible shore. I cannot understand I kept firm hold telescope. They say drowning man clutch straw. Perhaps may feeling me, I know hand time wrecked. However, felt pleasure us now, although see could much use us, glass small end broken pieces. Our sixth article brass ring Jack always wore his little finger. I never understood he wore it, Jack vain his appearance, seem care ornaments kind. Peterkin said "it memory girl he left behind him!" But he never spoke girl either us, I inclined think Peterkin either jesting mistaken. In addition articles little bit tinder, clothes back. These last follows:-- Each us pair stout canvas trousers, pair sailors' thick shoes. Jack wore red flannel shirt, blue jacket, red Kilmarnock bonnet nightcap, besides pair worsted socks, cotton pocket-handkerchief, sixteen portraits Lord Nelson printed it, Union Jack middle. Peterkin striped flannel shirt--which he wore outside his trousers, belted round his waist, manner tunic--and round black straw hat. He jacket, thrown cast sea; much consequence, climate island proved extremely mild--so much so, indeed, Jack I often preferred go without jackets. Peterkin also pair white cotton socks, blue handkerchief white spots it. My costume consisted blue flannel shirt, blue jacket, black cap, pair worsted socks, besides shoes canvas trousers already mentioned. This had, besides things nothing else; thought danger escaped, much worse might ship struck reef night, felt thankful possessed much, although, I must confess, sometimes wished little more. While examining things talking them, Jack suddenly started exclaimed-- "The oar! We forgotten oar." "What good us!" said Peterkin; "there is wood enough island make thousand oars." "Ay, lad," replied Jack; "but there is bit hoop-iron end it, may much use us." "Very true," said I, "let us go fetch it;" three rose hastened beach. I still felt little weak loss blood, companions soon began leave behind; Jack perceived this, and, his usual considerate good-nature, turned back help me. This first time I looked well since landing, spot I laid covered thick bushes, almost hid country view. As emerged among walked sandy beach together, I cast eyes about, truly heart glowed within spirits rose beautiful prospect I beheld every side. The gale suddenly died away, blown furiously till dashed ship upon rocks, nothing accomplishing that. The island stood hilly, covered almost everywhere beautiful richly coloured trees, bushes, shrubs, none I knew names time, except, indeed, cocoa-nut palms, I recognised many pictures I seen I left home. A sandy beach dazzling whiteness lined bright green shore, upon fell gentle ripple sea. This last astonished much, I recollected home sea used fall huge billows shore long storm subsided. But casting glance sea, became apparent. About mile distant shore, I saw great billows ocean rolling like green wall, falling long, loud roar upon low coral reef, dashed white foam flung clouds spray. This spray sometimes flew exceedingly high, every beautiful rainbow formed moment among falling drops. We afterwards found coral reef extended quite round island, formed natural breakwater it. Beyond sea rose tossed violently effects storm; reef shore calm smooth pond. My heart filled delight I express sight many glorious objects, thoughts turned suddenly contemplation Creator all. I mention gladly time, I ashamed say, I seldom thought Creator, although I constantly surrounded beautiful wonderful His works. I observed, expression companion's countenance, he derived much joy splendid scenery, agreeable us long voyage salt sea. There breeze fresh cold, delightfully mild; puff blew land, came laden exquisite perfume imagined. While thus gazed, startled loud "Huzza!" Peterkin, looking towards edge sea, saw capering jumping like monkey, ever anon tugging his might something lay upon shore. "What odd fellow he is, sure!" said Jack, taking arm hurrying forward; "come, let us hasten see is." "Here is, boys, hurrah! come along. Just want," cried Peterkin, drew near, still tugging his power. "First-rate; ticket!" I need scarcely say readers companion Peterkin habit using remarkable peculiar phrases. And I free confess I well understand meaning them--such, instance, "the ticket"; I think duty recount everything relating adventures strict regard truthfulness far memory serves me; I write, nearly possible, exact words companions spoke. I often asked Peterkin explain he meant "ticket," he always answered going fits laughter. However, observing occasions he used it, I came understand meant show something remarkably good fortunate. On coming up, found Peterkin vainly endeavouring pull axe oar, which, remembered, Jack struck endeavouring cut away cordage among become entangled bow ship. Fortunately us, axe remained fast oar, even Peterkin's strength could draw cut. "Ah! capital indeed," cried Jack, time giving axe wrench plucked tough wood. "How fortunate is! It value us hundred knives, edge quite new sharp." "I will answer toughness handle, rate," cried Peterkin; "my arms nearly pulled sockets. But see here, luck great. There iron blade." He pointed piece hoop-iron he spoke, nailed round blade oar prevent splitting. This also fortunate discovery. Jack went his knees, edge axe began carefully force nails. But firmly fixed in, operation blunted axe, carried oar us place left rest things, intending burn wood away iron convenient time. "Now, lads," said Jack, laid stone contained little all, "I propose go tail island, ship struck, quarter mile off, see anything else thrown ashore. I do not expect anything, well see. When get back here, time supper prepare beds." "Agreed!" cried Peterkin I together, as, indeed, would agreed proposal Jack made, for, besides his older much stronger taller either us, he clever fellow, I think would induced people much older choose leader, especially required led bold enterprise. Now, hastened along white beach, shone brightly rays setting sun eyes quite dazzled glare, suddenly came Peterkin's head nothing eat except wild berries grew profusion feet. "What shall do, Jack?" said he, rueful look; "perhaps may poisonous!" "No fear," replied Jack confidently; "I observed unlike berries grow wild native hills. Besides, I saw one two strange birds eating minutes ago, will not kill birds will not kill us. But look there, Peterkin," continued Jack, pointing branched head cocoa-nut palm. "There nuts us stages." "So are!" cried Peterkin, who, unobservant nature, much taken things notice anything high his head fruit palm tree. But whatever faults young comrade had, he could blamed want activity animal spirits. Indeed, nuts scarcely pointed he bounded tall stem tree like squirrel, minutes returned three nuts, large man's fist. "You better keep till return," said Jack. "Let us finish work eating." "So it, captain; go ahead," cried Peterkin, thrusting nuts his trousers pocket. "In fact, I do not want eat now, I would give good deal drink. Oh I could find spring! I do not see smallest sign one hereabouts. I say, Jack, happen seem everything? You told us names half-a-dozen trees already, yet say never South Seas before." "I am _everything_, Peterkin, you will find ere long," replied Jack, smile; "but I great reader books travel adventure life, put good many things are, perhaps, acquainted with." "O Jack, that is humbug. If begin lay everything credit books, I will quite lose opinion you," cried Peterkin, look contempt. "I have seen lot fellows _always_ poring books, came try _do_ anything, better baboons!" "You quite right," retorted Jack, "and I seen lot fellows never looked books all, knew nothing anything except things actually seen, little knew even these. Indeed, ignorant know cocoa-nuts grew cocoa-nut trees!" I could refrain laughing rebuke, much truth Peterkin's ignorance. "Humph! maybe you are right," answered Peterkin; "but I would give _tuppence_ man books, he nothing else him." "Neither would I," said Jack; "but that is reason run books down, think less read them. Suppose now, Peterkin, wanted build ship, I give long particular account way it, would useful?" "No doubt it," said Peterkin, laughing. "And suppose I write account letter instead telling words, would less useful?" "Well--no, perhaps not." "Well, suppose I print it, send form book, would good useful ever?" "Oh, bother! Jack, you are philosopher, that is worse anything!" cried Peterkin, look pretended horror. "Very well, Peterkin, shall see," returned Jack, halting shade cocoa-nut tree. "You said thirsty minute ago; jump tree bring nut--not ripe one, bring green, unripe one." Peterkin looked surprised, seeing Jack earnest, he obeyed. "Now cut hole penknife, clap mouth, old fellow," said Jack. Peterkin he directed, burst uncontrollable laughter changes instantly passed his expressive countenance. No sooner he put nut his mouth, thrown back his head order catch came it, his eyes opened twice ordinary size astonishment, his throat moved vigorously act swallowing. Then smile look intense delight overspread his face, except, indeed, mouth, which, firmly fixed hole nut, could take part expression; he endeavoured make winking us excessively his right eye. At length he stopped, and, drawing long breath, exclaimed-- "Nectar! perfect nectar! I say, Jack, you are Briton--the best fellow I ever met life.--Only taste that!" said he, turning holding nut mouth. I immediately drank, certainly I much surprised delightful liquid flowed copiously throat. It extremely cool, sweet taste, mingled acid; fact likest thing lemonade I ever tasted, grateful refreshing. I handed nut Jack, who, tasting it, said, "Now, Peterkin, unbeliever, I never saw tasted cocoa-nut life before, except sold shops home; I read green nuts contain stuff, see true!" "And pray," asked Peterkin, "what sort 'stuff' ripe nut contain?" "A hollow kernel," answered Jack, "with liquid like milk it; satisfy thirst well hunger. It wholesome food, I believe." "Meat drink tree!" cried Peterkin; "washing sea, lodging ground--and nothing. My dear boys, we are set life; must ancient Paradise--hurrah!" Peterkin tossed his straw hat air, ran along beach hallooing like madman delight. We afterwards found, however, lovely islands unlike Paradise many things. But proper place. We come point rocks ship struck, find single article, although searched carefully among coral rocks, place jutted far nearly join reef encircled island. Just return, however, saw something black floating little cove escaped observation. Running forward, drew water, found long, thick, leather boot, fishermen home wear; paces farther picked fellow. We recognised belonged captain, he worn whole storm, order guard his legs waves spray constantly washed decks. My first thought seeing dear captain drowned; Jack soon put mind rest point, saying captain drowned boots on, he would certainly washed ashore along them, he doubt whatever he kicked sea, he might swim easily. Peterkin immediately put on, large that, Jack said, would done boots, trousers, vest too. I also tried them, although I long enough legs them, much large feet me: handed Jack, anxious make keep them; fitted his large limbs feet made him, I would hear it, he consented last use them. I may remark, however, Jack use often, extremely heavy. It beginning grow dark returned encampment; put visit top hill till next day, employed light yet remained us cutting quantity boughs broad leaves tree none us knew name. With erected sort rustic bower, meant pass night. There absolute necessity this, air island genial balmy could slept quite well without shelter; little used sleeping open air quite relish idea lying without covering us; besides, bower would shelter us night-dews rain, happen fall. Having strewed floor leaves dry grass, bethought supper. But occurred us, first time, means making fire. "Now, there is fix! What shall do?" said Peterkin, turned eyes Jack, always looked difficulties. Jack seemed little perplexed. "There flints enough, doubt, beach," said he, "but use without steel. However, must try." So saying, he went beach, soon returned two flints. On one he placed tinder, endeavoured ignite it; great difficulty small spark struck flints, tinder, bad, hard piece, would catch. He tried bit hoop-iron, would strike fire all; back axe, better success. During trials Peterkin sat his hands his pockets, gazing melancholy visage comrade, his face growing longer miserable successive failure. "Oh dear!" he sighed; "I would care button cooking victuals--perhaps do not need it--but it is dismal eat one's supper dark; capital day it is pity finish glum style. Oh, I it!" he cried, starting up; "the spy-glass--the big glass end burning-glass!" "You forget sun," said I. Peterkin silent. In his sudden recollection telescope he quite overlooked absence sun. "Ah, boys, I have got now!" exclaimed Jack, rising cutting branch neighbouring bush, he stripped leaves. "I recollect seeing done home. Hand bit whip-cord." With cord branch Jack soon formed bow. Then he cut piece, three inches long, end dead branch, he pointed two ends. Round he passed cord bow, placed one end his chest, protected point chip wood; point he placed bit tinder, began saw vigorously bow, blacksmith his drill boring hole piece iron. In seconds tinder begun smoke; less minute caught fire; less quarter hour drinking lemonade eating cocoa-nuts round fire would roasted entire sheep, smoke, flames, sparks flew among broad leaves overhanging palm trees, cast warm glow upon leafy bower. That night starry sky looked gently rustling trees upon slumbers, distant roaring surf upon coral reef lullaby. Chapter V Morning, cogitations connected therewith--We luxuriate sea, try diving powers, make enchanting excursions among coral groves bottom ocean--The wonders deep enlarged upon. What joyful thing awaken, fresh glorious morning, find rising sun staring face dazzling brilliancy! see birds twittering bushes, hear murmuring rill, soft hissing ripples fall upon seashore! At time place sights sounds charming, especially one awakens them, first time, novel romantic situation, soft sweet air tropical climate mingling fresh smell sea, stirring strange leaves flutter overhead around one, ruffling plumage stranger birds fly inquiringly around, demand business intrude uninvited domains. When I awoke morning shipwreck, I found delightful condition; I lay back upon bed leaves, gazing branches cocoa-nut trees clear blue sky, watched fleecy clouds passed slowly across it, heart expanded exulting gladness, like I never felt before. While I meditated, thoughts turned great kind Creator beautiful world, done previous day, I first beheld sea coral reef, mighty waves dashing calm waters lagoon. While thus meditating, I naturally bethought Bible, I faithfully kept promise, I gave parting beloved mother, I would read every morning; feeling dismay I remembered I left ship. I much troubled this. However, I consoled reflecting I could keep second part promise her--namely, I never omit say prayers. So I rose quietly, lest I disturb companions, still asleep, stepped aside bushes purpose. On return I found still slumbering, I lay think situation. Just moment I attracted sight small parrot, Jack afterwards told called paroquet. It seated twig overhung Peterkin's head, I speedily lost admiration bright green plumage, mingled gay colours. While I looked I observed bird turned head slowly side side looked downwards, first one eye other. On glancing downwards I observed Peterkin's mouth wide open, remarkable bird looking it. Peterkin used say I atom fun composition, I never could understand joke. In regard latter, perhaps he right; yet I think that, explained me, I understood jokes well people. But regard former, he must certainly wrong, bird seemed extremely funny; I could help thinking that, happen faint, slip foot, fall twig Peterkin's mouth, he would perhaps think funny too! Suddenly paroquet bent head uttered loud scream his face. This awoke him, and, cry surprise, he started up, foolish bird flew precipitately away. "Oh, monster!" cried Peterkin, shaking his fist bird. Then he yawned, rubbed his eyes, asked of the clock was. I smiled question, answered that, watches bottom sea, I could tell, little past sunrise. Peterkin began remember were. As he looked bright sky, snuffed scented air, his eyes glistened delight, he uttered faint "Hurrah!" yawned again. Then he gazed slowly round, till, observing calm sea opening bushes, he started suddenly he received electric shock, uttered vehement shout, flung his garments, and, rushing white sands, plunged water. The cry awoke Jack, rose his elbow look grave surprise; followed quiet smile intelligence seeing Peterkin water. With energy he gave way moments excitement, Jack bounded his feet, threw his clothes, shook back his hair, and, lion-like spring, dashed sands plunged sea force quite envelop Peterkin shower spray. Jack remarkably good swimmer diver, his plunge saw sign nearly minute; he suddenly emerged, cry joy, good many yards shore. My spirits much raised seeing I, too, hastily threw garments endeavoured imitate Jack's vigorous bound; I awkward foot caught stump, I fell ground; I slipped stone running sand, nearly fell again, much amusement Peterkin, laughed heartily, called "slow coach," Jack cried out, "Come along, Ralph, I will help you." However, I got water, I managed well, I really good swimmer diver too. I could not, indeed, equal Jack, superior Englishman I ever saw; I infinitely surpassed Peterkin, could swim little, could dive all. While Peterkin enjoyed shallow water running along beach, Jack I swam deep water, occasionally dived stones. I shall never forget surprise delight first beholding bottom sea. As I stated, water within reef calm pond; and, wind, quite clear surface bottom, could see easily even depth twenty thirty yards. When Jack I dived shallower water, expected found sand stones, instead found appeared really enchanted garden. The whole bottom lagoon, called calm water within reef, covered coral every shape, size, hue. Some portions formed like large mushrooms; others appeared like brain man, stalks necks attached them; common kind species branching coral, portions lovely pale pink colour, others pure white. Among grew large quantities seaweed richest hues imaginable, graceful forms; innumerable fishes--blue, red, yellow, green, striped--sported amongst flower-beds submarine garden, appear afraid approaching them. On darting surface breath, first dive, Jack I rose close other. "Did ever life, Ralph, see anything lovely?" said Jack, he flung spray his hair. "Never," I replied. "It appears like fairy realms. I scarcely believe dreaming." "Dreaming!" cried Jack; "do know, Ralph, I am half tempted think really dreaming. But so, I resolved make it, dream another dive; goes--down again, boy!" We took second dive together, kept beside water; I greatly surprised find could keep much longer I ever recollect done seas home. I believe owing heat water, warm afterwards found could remain two three hours time without feeling unpleasant effects used experience sea home. When Jack reached bottom, he grasped coral stems, crept along his hands knees, peeping seaweed among rocks. I observed also pick one two large oysters retain his grasp, he meant take him, I also gathered few. Suddenly he made grasp fish blue yellow stripes back, actually touched tail, catch it. At he turned towards attempted smile; sooner he done he sprang like arrow surface, where, following him, I found gasping coughing, spitting water his mouth. In minutes he recovered, turned swim ashore. "I declare, Ralph," said he, "that I actually tried laugh water." "So I saw," I replied; "and I observed nearly caught fish tail. It would done capitally breakfast had." "Breakfast enough here," said he, holding oysters, landed ran beach. "Hallo, Peterkin! are, boy. Split open fellows Ralph I put clothes. They will agree cocoa-nuts excellently, I doubt." Peterkin, already dressed, took oysters, opened edge axe, exclaiming, "Now, _is_ capital. There is nothing I am fond of." "Ah! that is lucky," remarked Jack. "I will able keep good order now, Master Peterkin. You know cannot dive better cat. So, sir, whenever behave ill, shall oysters breakfast." "I am glad prospect breakfast good," said I, "for I am hungry." "Here, then, stop mouth that, Ralph," said Peterkin, holding large oyster lips. I opened mouth swallowed silence, really remarkably good. We set earnestly preparations spending day. We difficulty fire morning, burning-glass admirable one; roasted oysters ate cocoa-nuts, held long, animated conversation plans future. What plans were, carried effect, reader shall see hereafter. Chapter VI An excursion interior, make many valuable interesting discoveries--We get dreadful fright--The bread-fruit tree--Wonderful peculiarity fruit-trees--Signs former inhabitants. Our first care, breakfast, place articles possessed crevice rock farther end small cave discovered near encampment. This cave, hoped, might useful us afterwards storehouse. Then cut two large clubs species hard tree grew near hand. One given Peterkin, me, Jack armed axe. We took precautions purposed make excursion top mountains interior, order obtain better view island. Of course knew dangers might befall us way, thought best prepared. Having completed arrangements carefully extinguished fire, sallied forth walked short distance along sea-beach, till came entrance valley, flowed rivulet mentioned. Here turned backs sea struck interior. The prospect burst upon view entering valley truly splendid. On either side us gentle rise land, thus formed two ridges mile apart side valley. These ridges--which, well low grounds them, covered trees shrubs luxuriant kind--continued recede inland two miles, joined foot small mountain. This hill rose rather abruptly head valley, likewise entirely covered even top trees, except one particular spot near left shoulder, bare rocky place broken savage character. Beyond hill could see, therefore directed course banks rivulet towards foot it, intending climb top, possible, as, indeed, doubt was. Jack wisest boldest among us, took lead, carrying axe his shoulder. Peterkin, his enormous club, came second, he said he like position defend danger threaten. I brought rear, but, taken wonderful curious things I saw starting thoughts possible danger, I foolishly left club behind me. Although, I said, trees bushes luxuriant, thickly crowded together hinder progress among them. We able wind out, follow banks stream quite easily, although, true, height thickness foliage prevented us seeing far ahead. But sometimes jutting-out rock hillsides afforded us position whence could enjoy romantic view mark progress towards foot hill. I particularly struck, walk, richness undergrowth places, recognised many berries plants resembled native land, especially tall, elegantly formed fern, emitted agreeable perfume. There several kinds flowers, too, I see many I expected climate. We also saw great variety small birds bright plumage, many paroquets similar one awoke Peterkin rudely morning. Thus advanced foot hill without encountering anything alarm us, except, indeed, once, passing close part hill hidden view broad leaves banana trees, grew great luxuriance part. Jack preparing force his way thicket, startled arrested strange pattering rumbling sound appeared us quite different sounds heard previous part walk. "Hallo!" cried Peterkin, stopping short grasping his club hands, "what is that?" Neither us replied; Jack seized his axe his right hand, he pushed aside broad leaves endeavoured peer amongst them. "I see nothing," he said, short pause. "I think it--" Again rumbling sound came, louder before, sprang back stood defensive. For myself, forgotten club, taken precaution cut another, I buttoned jacket, doubled fists, threw boxing attitude. I must say, however, I felt somewhat uneasy; companions afterwards confessed thoughts moment instantly filled ever heard read wild beasts savages, torturings stake, roastings alive, like horrible things. Suddenly pattering noise increased tenfold violence. It followed fearful crash among bushes, rapidly repeated, gigantic animal bounding towards us. In another moment enormous rock came crashing shrubbery, followed cloud dust small stones, flew close past spot stood, carrying bushes young trees along it. "Pooh! all?" exclaimed Peterkin, wiping perspiration his forehead. "Why, I thought wild men beasts South Sea Islands galloping one grand charge sweep us face earth, instead mere stone tumbling mountainside." "Nevertheless," remarked Jack, "if stone hit us, would rendered charge speak quite unnecessary, Peterkin." This true, I felt thankful escape. On examining spot narrowly, found lay close foot rugged precipice, stones various sizes always tumbling intervals. Indeed, numerous fragments lying scattered around might suggested sound, suddenly alarmed think anything. We resumed journey, resolving that, future excursions interior, would careful avoid dangerous precipice. Soon afterwards arrived foot hill prepared ascend it. Here Jack made discovery caused us great joy. This tree remarkably beautiful appearance, Jack confidently declared celebrated bread-fruit tree. "Is celebrated?" inquired Peterkin, look great simplicity. "It is," replied Jack. "That is odd, now," rejoined Peterkin; "I never heard before." "Then it is celebrated I thought was," returned Jack, quietly squeezing Peterkin's hat his eyes; "but listen, ignorant booby! hear now." Peterkin readjusted his hat, soon listening much interest myself, Jack told us tree one valuable islands south; bears two, sometimes three, crops fruit year; fruit like wheaten bread appearance, constitutes principal food many islanders. "So," said Peterkin, "we seem everything ready prepared hands wonderful island--lemonade ready bottled nuts, loaf-bread growing trees!" Peterkin, usual, jesting; nevertheless, curious fact he spoke almost literal truth. "Moreover," continued Jack, "the bread-fruit tree affords capital gum, serves natives pitching canoes; bark young branches made cloth; wood, durable good colour, build houses. So see, lads, lack material make us comfortable, clever enough use it." "But sure that is it?" asked Peterkin. "Quite sure," replied Jack; "for I particularly interested account I read it, I remember description well. I sorry, however, I forgotten descriptions many trees I sure seen to-day, could recognise them. So see, Peterkin, I am everything yet." "Never mind, Jack," said Peterkin, grave, patronising expression countenance, patting his tall companion shoulder--"never mind, Jack; know good deal age. You are clever boy, sir--a promising young man; go begun, sir, will----" The end speech suddenly cut short Jack tripping Peterkin's heels tumbling mass thick shrubs, where, finding comfortable, he lay still, basking sunshine, Jack I examined bread-fruit tree. We much struck deep, rich green colour broad leaves, twelve eighteen inches long, deeply indented, glossy smoothness, like laurel. The fruit, loaded, nearly round, appeared six inches diameter, rough rind, marked lozenge-shaped divisions. It various colours, light pea-green brown rich yellow. Jack said yellow ripe fruit. We afterwards found fruit-trees island evergreens, might, wished, pluck blossom ripe fruit tree. Such wonderful difference trees country surprised us little. The bark tree rough light-coloured; trunk two feet diameter, appeared twenty feet high, quite destitute branches height, branched beautiful umbrageous head. We noticed fruit hung clusters twos threes branches; anxious get top hill, refrained attempting pluck time. Our hearts much cheered good fortune, light active steps clambered steep sides hill. On reaching summit, new and, possible, grander prospect, met gaze. We found highest part island, another hill lay beyond, wide valley one stood. This valley, like first, also full rich trees, dark light green, heavy thick foliage, others light, feathery, graceful, beautiful blossoms many threw sort rainbow tint all, gave valley appearance garden flowers. Among recognised many bread-fruit trees, laden yellow fruit, also great many cocoa-nut palms. After gazing fill, pushed hillside, crossed valley, soon began ascend second mountain. It clothed trees nearly top, summit bare, places broken. While way came object filled us much interest. This stump tree evidently cut axe! So, then, first viewed beautiful isle. The hand man work us. It began recur us perhaps island inhabited, although seen traces man now; second glance stump convinced us reason think formerly; surface wood quite decayed, partly covered fungus green matter, must cut many years ago. "Perhaps," said Peterkin, "some ship touched long ago wood, taken one tree." We think likely, however, because, circumstances, crew ship would cut wood small size, near shore, whereas large tree stood near top mountain. In fact, highest large tree mountain, wood recent growth. "I cannot understand it," said Jack, scratching surface stump his axe. "I suppose savages cut purpose known themselves. But, hallo! here?" As he spoke, Jack began carefully scrape away moss fungus stump, soon laid bare three distinct traces marks, inscription initials cut thereon. But although traces distinct, beyond doubt, exact form letters could made out. Jack thought looked like J. S., could certain. They apparently carelessly cut, long exposure weather broken could make were. We exceedingly perplexed discovery, stayed long time place conjecturing marks could been, without avail; so, day advancing, left quickly reached top mountain. We found highest point island, saw kingdom lying, were, like map around us. As I always thought impossible get thing properly one's understanding without comprehending it, I shall beg reader's patience little I describe island, thus, shortly:-- It consisted two mountains: one guessed 500 feet; other, stood, 1000. Between lay rich, beautiful valley, already said. This valley crossed island one end other, high middle sloping side towards sea. The large mountain sloped, side farthest wrecked, gradually towards sea; although, viewed glance, thus regular sloping appearance, careful observation showed broken multitude small vales, rather dells glens, intermingled little rugged spots small abrupt precipices there, rivulets tumbling edges wandering slopes little white streams, sometimes glistening among broad leaves bread-fruit cocoa-nut trees, hiding altogether beneath rich underwood. At base mountain lay narrow bright green plain meadow, terminated abruptly shore. On side island, whence come, stood smaller hill, foot diverged three valleys; one ascended, smaller vale side it, separated two ridges mentioned. In smaller valleys streams, clothed luxuriant vegetation. The diameter island seemed ten miles, almost circular form, circumference must thirty miles--perhaps little more, allowance made numerous bays indentations shore. The entire island belted beach pure white sand, laved gentle ripples lagoon. We also observed coral reef completely encircled island; varied distance there, places mile beach, others hundred yards, average distance half mile. The reef lay low, spray surf broke quite many places. This surf never ceased roar, however calm weather might be, always gentle swaying motion great Pacific, which, although scarce noticeable sea, reaches shore last huge billow. The water within lagoon, said, perfectly still. There three narrow openings reef: one opposite end valley I described crossing island; opposite valley, afterwards named Valley Wreck. At openings reef rose two small green islets, covered bushes one two cocoa-nut palms each. These islets singular, appeared planted expressly purpose marking channel lagoon. Our captain making one openings day wrecked, would reached too, I doubt not, rudder torn away. Within lagoon several pretty, low coral islands, opposite encampment; immediately beyond these, sea, lay dozen islands, various distances, half mile ten miles;--all them, far could discern, smaller apparently uninhabited. They seemed low coral islands, raised little sea, yet covered cocoa-nut trees. All noted great deal more, sat top mountain. After satisfied prepared return; discovered traces presence man. These pole staff one two pieces wood squared axe. All were, however, much decayed, evidently touched many years. Full discoveries returned encampment. On way fell traces four-footed animal, whether old recent date none us able guess. This also tended raise hopes obtaining animal food island, reached home good spirits, quite prepared supper, highly satisfied excursion. After much discussion, Peterkin took lead, came conclusion island uninhabited, went bed. Chapter VII Jack's ingenuity--We get difficulties fishing, get method gives us cold bath--Horrible encounter shark. For several days excursion related last chapter wander far encampment, gave forming plans future making present abode comfortable. There various causes induced state comparative inaction. In first place, although everything around us delightful, could without difficulty obtain required bodily comfort, quite like idea settling rest lives, far away friends native land. To set energetically preparations permanent residence seemed like making minds saying adieu home friends ever, tacitly shrank it, put preparations, one reason another, long could. Then little uncertainty still natives island, entertained kind faint hope ship might come take us off. But day day passed, neither savages ships appeared, gave hope early deliverance, set diligently work homestead. During time, however, altogether idle. We made several experiments cooking cocoa-nut, improve it. Then removed goods, took abode cave, found change bad returned gladly bower. Besides this, bathed frequently, talked great deal: least Jack Peterkin did--I listened. Among useful things, Jack, ever active diligent, converted three inches hoop-iron excellent knife. First he beat quite flat axe. Then he made rude handle, tied hoop-iron piece whipcord, ground edge piece sandstone. When finished, he used shape better handle, he fixed strip his cotton handkerchief--in operation he had, Peterkin pointed out, torn one Lord Nelson's noses. However, whipcord, thus set free, used Peterkin fishing-line. He merely tied piece oyster end it. This fish allowed swallow, pulled quickly ashore. But line short boat, fish caught exceedingly small. One day Peterkin came beach, he angling, said cross tone, "I will tell what, Jack, I am going humbugged catching contemptible things longer. I want swim back, let fish deep water!" "Dear me, Peterkin!" replied Jack, "I idea taking thing much heart, else I would got difficulty long ago. Let see"--and Jack looked piece timber he labouring, peculiar gaze abstraction, he always assumed trying invent discover anything. "What say building boat?" he inquired, looking hastily. "Take far long," reply; "cannot bothered waiting. I want begin once!" Again Jack considered. "I it!" he cried. "We will fell large tree launch trunk water, want fish you have nothing swim it." "Would small raft better?" said I. "Much better; ropes bind together with. Perhaps may find something hereafter well, meantime let us try tree." This agreed on, started spot far distant, knew tree would suit us, grew near water's edge. As soon reached Jack threw his coat, and, wielding axe his sturdy arms, hacked hewed quarter hour without stopping. Then he paused, he sat rest I continued work. Then Peterkin made vigorous attack it, Jack renewed his powerful blows, minutes cutting brought terrible crash. "Hurrah! it," cried Jack; "let us head." So saying he began cut stem again, six yards thick end. This done, he cut three strong, short poles levers stout branches, roll log beach sea; for, nearly two feet thick large end, could move without helps. With levers, however, rolled slowly sea. Having thus successful launching vessel, next shaped levers rude oars paddles, attempted embark. This easy enough do; seating astride log, utmost difficulty kept rolling round plunging us water. Not minded much; preferred, possible, fish dry clothes. To sure, trousers necessarily wet, legs dangling water side log; could easily dried, care. After half-an-hour's practice, became expert enough keep balance pretty steadily. Then Peterkin laid his paddle, baited his line whole oyster, dropped deep water. "Now then, Jack," said he, "be cautious; steer clear seaweed. There! that is it; gently now, gently. I see fellow least foot long there, coming to--ha! that is it! Oh bother! he is off." "Did he bite?" said Jack, urging log onwards little his paddle. "Bite? ay! He took his mouth, moment I began haul he opened his jaws let again." "Let swallow next time," said Jack, laughing melancholy expression Peterkin's visage. "There he is again," cried Peterkin, his eyes flashing excitement. "Look out! Now then! No! Yes! No! Why brute _won't_ swallow it!" "Try haul mouth, then," cried Jack. "Do gently." A heavy sigh look blank despair showed poor Peterkin tried failed again. "Never mind, lad," said Jack, voice sympathy, "we will move on, offer fish." So saying, Jack plied his paddle; scarcely he moved spot, fish enormous head little body darted rock swallowed bait once. "Got time--that is fact!" cried Peterkin, hauling line. "He is swallowed bait right his tail, I declare. Oh, thumper!" As fish came struggling surface, leaned forward see it, overbalanced log. Peterkin threw his arms round fish's neck, another instant floundering water. A shout laughter burst us rose surface like three drowned rats, seized hold log. We soon recovered position, sat warily, Peterkin secured fish, well-nigh escaped midst struggles. It little worth having, however; but, Peterkin remarked, better smouts he catching last two three days; laid log us, re-baited line, dropped another. Now, thus intent upon sport, attention suddenly attracted ripple sea, yards away us. Peterkin shouted us paddle direction, he thought big fish, might chance catching it. But Jack, instead complying, said, deep, earnest tone voice, I never heard use--"Haul line, Peterkin; seize paddle; quick--it is shark!" The horror heard may well imagined, must remembered legs hanging water, could venture pull without upsetting log. Peterkin instantly hauled line, grasping his paddle, exerted utmost, also best make shore. But good way off, log being, I said, heavy, moved slowly water. We saw shark quite distinctly swimming round round us, sharp fin every protruding water. From active unsteady motions, Jack knew making mind attack us, he urged us vehemently paddle lives, he set us example. Suddenly he shouted, "Look out! he comes!" second saw monstrous fish dive close us, turn half his side. But made great commotion paddles, doubt frightened away time, saw immediately circling round us before. "Throw fish him," cried Jack, quick, suppressed voice; "we will make shore time yet keep minutes." Peterkin stopped one instant obey command, plied his paddle his might. No sooner fish fallen water observed shark sink. In another second saw white breast rising; sharks always turn sides seize prey, mouths point heads like fish, but, were, chins. In another moment his snout rose water; his wide jaws, armed terrific double row teeth, appeared. The dead fish engulfed, shark sank sight. But Jack mistaken supposing would satisfied. In minutes returned us, quick motions led us fear would attack us once. "Stop paddling," cried Jack suddenly. "I see coming behind us. Now, obey orders _quickly_. Our lives may depend it. Ralph, Peterkin, best _balance log_. Do not look shark. Do not glance behind you. Do nothing balance log." Peterkin I instantly ordered, glad anything afforded us chance hope escape, implicit confidence Jack's courage wisdom. For seconds, seemed long minutes mind, sat thus silently; I could resist glancing backward, despite orders contrary. On so, I saw Jack sitting rigid like statue, his paddle raised, his lips compressed, his eyebrows bent his eyes, glared savagely beneath water. I also saw shark, horror, quite close log, act darting towards Jack's foot. I could scarce suppress cry beholding this. In another moment shark rose. Jack drew his leg suddenly water, threw log. The monster's snout rubbed log passed, revealed hideous jaws, Jack instantly plunged paddle, thrust throat. So violent act Jack rose his feet performing it; log thereby rolled completely over, plunged water. We rose, spluttering gasping, moment. "Now, then, strike shore," cried Jack. "Here, Peterkin, catch hold collar, kick will." Peterkin he desired, Jack struck force he cut water like boat; I, free encumbrance, succeeded keeping him. As time drawn pretty near shore, minutes sufficed carry us shallow water; and, finally, landed safety, though much exhausted, little frightened terrible adventure. Chapter VIII The beauties bottom sea tempt Peterkin dive--How he it--More difficulties overcome--The Water Garden--Curious creatures sea--The tank--Candles missed much, candle-nut tree discovered--Wonderful account Peterkin's first voyage--Cloth found growing tree--A plan projected, arms prepared offence defence--A dreadful cry. Our encounter shark first great danger befallen us since landing island, felt seriously affected it, especially considered often unwittingly incurred danger bathing. We forced take fishing shallow water, succeed constructing raft. What troubled us most, however, was, compelled forego morning swimming excursions. We did, indeed, continue enjoy bathe shallow water, Jack I found one great source enjoyment gone, could longer dive among beautiful coral groves bottom lagoon. We come fond exercise, take interest watching formations coral gambols many beautiful fish amongst forest red green seaweeds, become quite familiar appearance fish localities chiefly haunted. We also become expert divers. But made rule never stay long water time. Jack told often bad lungs, and, instead affording us enjoyment, would ere long us serious injury. So never stayed bottom long might done, came frequently top fresh air, dived immediately. Sometimes, Jack happened humorous frame, he would seat bottom sea one brain-corals, he seated large paddock-stool, make faces me, order, possible, make laugh water. At first, he took unawares, he nearly succeeded, I shoot surface order laugh; afterwards I became aware his intentions, naturally grave disposition, I difficulty restraining myself. I used often wonder poor Peterkin would liked us; he sometimes expressed much regret unable join us. I used best gratify him, poor fellow, relating wonders saw; this, instead satisfying, seemed whet his curiosity more, one day prevailed try go us. But although brave boy every way, Peterkin nervous water, difficulty got consent taken down, he could never managed push bottom without assistance. But sooner pulled yard deep clear water, he began struggle kick violently; forced let go, he rose water like cork, gave loud gasp frightful roar, struck land utmost possible haste. Now pleasure forego, thought thereon, Jack I felt much depressed spirits. I could see, also, Peterkin grieved sympathised us, talking matter he refrained jesting bantering us upon it. As, however, man's difficulties usually set upon devising methods overcome them, whereby he often discovers better things he may lost, difficulty induced us think searching large pool among rocks, water deep enough diving, yet surrounded rocks prevent sharks getting us. And pool afterwards found, proved much better sanguine hopes anticipated. It situated ten minutes' walk camp, form small deep bay basin, entrance which, besides narrow, shallow fish large shark could get in, least unless he remarkably thin one. Inside basin, called Water Garden, coral formations much wonderful, seaweed plants far lovely vividly coloured, lagoon itself. And water clear still, that, although deep, could see minutest object bottom. Besides this, ledge rock overhung basin deepest part, could dive pleasantly, whereon Peterkin could sit see wonders I described him, also see Jack creeping amongst marine shrubbery bottom, like--as he expressed it--"two great white sea-monsters." During excursions bottom sea, began get insight manners customs inhabitants, make discoveries wonderful things, like never conceived. Among things, deeply interested operations little coral insect which, I informed Jack, supposed entirely constructed many numerous islands Pacific Ocean. And certainly, considered great reef insects formed round island cast, observed ceaseless activity building myriad cells, first seem might true; then, again, I looked mountains island, reflected thousands such, many much higher, South Seas, I doubted must mistake here. But hereafter. I also became much taken manners appearance anemones, star-fish, crabs, sea-urchins, such-like creatures; content watching I saw dives Water Garden, I must needs scoop hole coral rock close it, I filled salt water, stocked sundry specimens anemones she will-fish, order watch closely habit passing time. Our burning-glass also became great treasure me, enabled magnify, perceive clearly forms actions curious creatures deep. Having got comfortable condition, began talk project long contemplation--namely, travel entirely round island; order, first, ascertain whether contained productions might useful us; and, second, see whether might place convenient suitable permanent residence encamped. Not degree dissatisfied it; contrary, entertained quite home-feeling bower neighbourhood; better place exist, reason make use it. At rate, would well know existence. We much earnest talk matter. But Jack proposed that, undertaking excursion, supply good defensive arms; intended go round shore, descend valleys, returning home, likely meet with, he would say _dangers_, least everything existed island, whatever might be. "Besides," said Jack, "it will not us live cocoa-nuts oysters always. No doubt excellent way, I think little animal food would agreeable well good us; many small birds among trees, probably good eat, I think would capital plan make bows arrows, could easily knock over." "First-rate!" cried Peterkin. "You make bows, Jack, I will try hand arrows. The fact is, I am quite tired throwing stones birds. I began day landed, I think, persevered present time, I have never hit anything yet." "You forget," said I, "you hit one day shin." "Ah, true," replied Peterkin, "and precious shindy kicked consequence. But least four yards away impudent paroquet I aimed at; see horribly bad shot I am." "But," said I, "Jack, cannot make three bows arrows to-morrow, would pity waste time, made minds go expedition? Suppose make one bow arrow yourself, take clubs?" "That is true, Ralph. The day pretty far advanced, I doubt I make even one bow dark. To sure, I might work firelight, sun goes down." We had, time, habit going bed sun, pressing call work nights; and, indeed, work day usually hard enough--what fishing, improving bower, diving Water Garden, rambling woods; night came usually glad retire beds. But desire work night, felt wish candles. "Will not good blazing fire give light enough?" inquired Peterkin. "Yes," replied Jack, "quite enough; give us great deal enough heat warm climate ours." "True," said Peterkin; "I forgot that. It would roast us." "Well, you are always rate," remarked Jack, "we could scarcely call change. But fact is, I have thinking subject before. There certain nut growing islands called candle-nut, natives use instead candles, I know it, prepare burning--" "Then do not it?" interrupted Peterkin. "Why kept us dark long, vile philosopher?" "Because," said Jack, "I seen tree yet, I am sure I know either tree nuts I see them. You see, I forget description." "Ah! that is way me," said Peterkin, deep sigh. "I never could keep mind half-an-hour descriptions I ever attempted remember. The first voyage I ever made caused mistaking description, forgetting it, thing. And horrible voyage was. I fight captain whole way out, made homeward voyage swimming!" "Come, Peterkin," said I, "you cannot get even _me_ believe that." "Perhaps not, it is true notwithstanding," returned Peterkin, pretending hurt doubting his word. "Let us hear happened," said Jack, good-natured smile overspread his face. "Well, must know," began Peterkin, "that day I went sea, I greatly taken game hockey, I playing old school-fellows last time leaving them--you see I young then, Ralph." Peterkin gazed, abstracted melancholy manner, sea. "Well, midst game, uncle, taken bother trouble getting bound 'prentice rigged out, came took aside, told he called suddenly away home, would able see aboard, he intended. 'However,' said he, 'the captain knows coming, that is much consequence; you will find ship yourself, must remember her name description. D'ye hear, boy?' I certainly hear, I am afraid I understand, mind taken game, I saw side losing, I began grow impatient, moment uncle finished his description ship bade good-bye, I bolted back game, confused idea three masts, green painted tafferel, gilt figure-head Hercules his club bow. Next day I much cast everybody saying good-bye, lot female friends cryin' horribly me, I start harbour, ship lying among thousand others, till almost late. So I run whole way. When I reached pier, many masts, much confusion, I felt quite humble-bumbled faculties. 'Now,' said I myself, 'Peterkin, you are fix.' Then I fancied I saw gilt figure-head three masts, belonging ship start; I darted board, speedily jumped shore I found two masts belonged another vessel, figure-head third! At last I caught sight I made sure it--a fine large vessel casting her moorings. The tafferel green. Three masts--yes, must it--and gilt figure-head Hercules. To sure, three-pronged pitchfork hand instead club; might uncle's mistake, perhaps Hercules sometimes varied his weapons. 'Cast off!' roared voice quarter-deck. 'Hold on!' cried I, rushing frantically crowd. 'Hold on! hold on!' repeated bystanders, men ropes delayed minute. This threw captain frightful rage; his friends come see off, his orders contradicted flatly much him. However, delay sufficient. I took race good leap; ropes cast off; steam-tug gave puff, started. Suddenly captain walks me: 'Where come from, scamp, want here?' "'Please, sir,' said I, touching cap, 'I am new 'prentice come aboard.' "'New 'prentice!' said he, stamping; 'I have got new 'prentice. My boys aboard already. This trick, young blackguard. You have run away, have;' captain stamped deck swore dreadfully; for, see, thought stop ship lower boat lose half-an-hour, sake sending small boy ashore, seemed make angry. Besides, blowin' fresh outside harbour, let steamer alongside put easy job. Just passing pierhead, several boats rowing harbour, captain came me. "'You have run away, blackguard,' he said, giving box ear. "'No, I have not,' said I angrily; box means light one. "'Hark'ee, boy, swim?' "'Yes,' said I. "'Then it;' seizing trousers nape neck, he tossed side sea. The fellows boats end pier backed oars seeing this; observing I could swim, allowed make best way pierhead. So see, Ralph, I really swim first homeward voyage." Jack laughed, patted Peterkin shoulder. "But tell us candle-nut tree," said I; "you talking it." "Very true," said Jack, "but I fear I remember little it. I believe nut size walnut; I think leaves white, I sure." "Eh! ha! hum!" exclaimed Peterkin, "I saw tree answering description day." "Did you?" cried Jack. "Is far this?" "No, half mile." "Then lead it," said Jack, seizing his axe. In minutes three pushing underwood forest, headed Peterkin. We soon came tree question, which, Jack closely examined it, concluded must candle-nut tree. Its leaves beautiful silvery white, formed fine contrast dark-green foliage surrounding trees. We immediately filled pockets nuts, Jack said-- "Now, Peterkin, climb cocoa-nut tree cut one long branches." This soon done, cost trouble, stem high, Peterkin usually pulled nuts younger trees, he much accustomed climbing high ones. The leaf branch large one, surprised size strength. Viewed little distance, cocoa-nut tree seems tall, straight stem, without single branch except top, tuft feathery-looking leaves, seem wave like soft plumes wind. But saw one leaves branches feet, found strong stalk, fifteen feet long, number narrow, pointed leaflets ranged alternately side. But seemed us wonderful thing curious substance resembling cloth, wrapped round thick end stalk, cut tree. Peterkin told us he greatest difficulty separating branch stem account substance, wrapped quite round tree, and, he observed, round branches, thus forming strong support large leaves exposed high winds. When I call substance cloth I exaggerate. Indeed, regard things I saw eventful career South Seas, I exceedingly careful exaggerate, way mislead deceive readers. This cloth, I say, remarkably like coarse brown cotton cloth. It seam fibre centre it, diverged fibres, size bristle. There two layers fibres, long tough, one layer crossing obliquely, whole cemented together still finer fibrous adhesive substance. When regarded attentively, could difficulty believe woven human hands. This remarkable piece cloth stripped carefully off, found two feet long foot broad, carried home us great prize. Jack took one leaflets, and, cutting central spine stalk, hurried back camp. Having made small fire, he baked nuts slightly, peeled husks. After he wished bore hole them, which, anything better hand time, he point useless pencil-case. Then he strung cocoa-nut spine, putting light topmost nut, found joy burned clear, beautiful flame; upon seeing which, Peterkin sprang danced round fire least five minutes excess his satisfaction. "Now, lads," said Jack, extinguishing candle, "the sun set hour, time lose. I shall go cut young tree make bow of, better go select good strong sticks clubs, we will set work dark." So saying he shouldered his axe went off, followed Peterkin, I took piece newly discovered cloth, fell examining structure. So engrossed I I still sitting attitude occupation companions returned. "I told so!" cried Peterkin, loud laugh. "O Ralph, you are incorrigible. See, there is club you. I sure, left looking bit stuff, would find poring came back, I cut club well myself." "Thank you, Peterkin," said I. "It kind that, instead scolding lazy fellow, I confess I deserve." "Oh, that," returned Peterkin, "I will blow yet, wish it; would use I did, you are perfect mule!" As getting dark lighted candle, placing holder made two crossing branches, inside bower, seated leafy beds began work. "I intend appropriate bow use," said Jack, chipping piece wood he brought his axe. "I used pretty fair shot once. But what is you are doing?" he added, looking Peterkin, drawn end long pole tent, endeavouring fit small piece hoop-iron end it. "I am going enlist Lancers," answered Peterkin. "You see, Jack, I find club rather unwieldy instrument delicately formed muscles, I flatter I shall execution spear." "Well, length constitutes power," said Jack, "you will certainly invincible." The pole Peterkin cut full twelve feet long, strong light tough young tree, merely required thinning butt serviceable weapon. "That is good idea," said I. "Which--this?" inquired Peterkin, pointing spear. "Yes," I replied. "Humph!" said he; "you would find pretty tough matter-of-fact idea stuck gizzard, old boy!" "I mean idea making good one," said I, laughing. "And, I think it, I will change plan too. I do not think much club, I will make sling piece cloth. I used fond slinging, ever since I read David slaying Goliath Philistine, I thought expert it." So I set work manufacture sling. For long time worked busily without speaking. At length Peterkin looked up. "I say, Jack, I am sorry say I must apply another strip handkerchief, tie rascally head with. It is pretty well torn rate, will not miss it." Jack proceeded comply request, Peterkin suddenly laid his hand his arm arrested him. "Hist, man," said he, "be tender; never needlessly cruel help it. Do try shave past Lord Nelson's mouth without tearing it, possible! Thanks. There plenty handkerchiefs cocoa-nut trees." Poor Peterkin! pleasant feelings I recall record his jests humorous sayings now! While thus engaged, startled distant strange horrible cry. It seemed come sea, far away could clearly distinguish precise direction. Rushing bower, hastened beach stayed listen. Again came quite loud distinct night air--a prolonged, hideous cry, something like braying ass. The moon risen, could see islands beyond lagoon quite plainly, object visible account cry. A strong gust wind blowing point whence sound came, died away gazing sea. "What be?" said Peterkin low whisper, involuntarily crept closer other. "Do know," said Jack, "I heard mysterious sound twice before, never loud to-night. Indeed faint I thought I must merely fancied it, so, I wish alarm you, I said nothing it." We listened long time sound again, come, returned bower resumed work. "Very strange," said Peterkin, quite gravely. "Do believe ghosts, Ralph?" "No," I answered, "I not. Nevertheless I must confess strange, unaccountable sounds, heard, make feel little uneasy." "What say it, Jack?" "I neither believe ghosts feel uneasy," he replied. "I never saw ghost myself, I never met one had; I generally found strange unaccountable things almost always accounted for, found quite simple close examination. I certainly cannot imagine _that_ sound is; I am quite sure I shall find long, it is ghost I will--I will--" "Eat it," cried Peterkin. "Yes, I will eat it! Now, then, bow two arrows finished; ready better turn in." By time Peterkin thinned his spear tied iron point cleverly end it; I formed sling, lines composed thin strips cocoa-nut cloth, plaited; Jack made stout bow, nearly five feet long, two arrows, feathered two three large plumes bird dropped. They barbs, Jack said arrows well feathered require iron points, would fly quite well merely sharpened point; I know before. "A feathered arrow without barb," said he, "is good weapon, barbed arrow without feathers utterly useless." The string bow formed piece whipcord, part which, he like cut it, rolled round bow. Although thus prepared start morrow, thought wise exercise little use weapons starting, spent whole next day practising. And well so, found arms imperfect, far perfect use them. First, Jack found bow much strong, he thin it. Also spear much heavy, reduced thickness, although nothing would induce Peterkin shortened. My sling answered well, I fallen much practice first stone knocked Peterkin's hat, narrowly missed making second Goliath him. However, spent whole day diligent practice, began find former expertness returning--at least Jack I did. As Peterkin, naturally neat-handed boy, he soon handled his spear well, could run full tilt cocoa-nut, hit great precision every five times. But I feel satisfied owed much rapid success unflagging energy Jack, insisted since made captain, obey him; he kept us work morning till night, perseveringly, thing. Peterkin wished much run stick his spear everything he passed; Jack put cocoa-nut, would let leave running moment, except he wanted rest. We laughed Jack this, convinced us much good. That night examined repaired arms ere lay rest, although much fatigued, order might readiness set expedition daylight following morning. Chapter IX Prepare journey round island--Sagacious reflections--Mysterious appearances startling occurrences. Scarcely sun shot first ray across bosom broad Pacific, Jack sprang his feet, and, hallooing Peterkin's ear awaken him, ran beach take his customary dip sea. We not, will not, bathe morning Water Garden, but, order save time, refreshed shallow water opposite bower. Our breakfast also despatched without loss time, less hour afterwards preparations journey completed. In addition his ordinary dress, Jack tied belt cocoa-nut cloth round his waist, he thrust axe. I also advised put belt carry short cudgel bludgeon it; for, Jack truly remarked, sling would little use chance come close quarters wild animal. As Peterkin, notwithstanding he carried long, I must add, frightful-looking spear his shoulder, could prevail leave his club behind; "for," said he, "a spear close quarters worth button." I must say seemed club was, use his style language, worth button-hole; knotted head, something like club I remember observed picture-books Jack Giant Killer, besides heavy he required grasp hands order wield all. However, he took him, manner set upon travels. We consider necessary carry food us, knew wherever went certain fall cocoa-nut trees; amply supplied, Peterkin said, meat drink pocket-handkerchiefs! I took precaution, however, put burning-glass pocket lest want fire. The morning exceedingly lovely. It one still peaceful sort made noises heard seem _quiet_ noises. I know way expressing idea. Noises which, far interrupting universal tranquillity earth, sea, sky, rather tended reveal us quiet world round us really was. Such sounds I refer were, peculiar melancholy--yet, seemed me, cheerful--plaint sea-birds floating glassy waters sailing sky, also subdued twittering little birds among bushes, faint ripples beach, solemn boom surf upon distant coral reef. We felt glad hearts walked along sands side side. For part, I felt deeply overjoyed I surprised sensations, fell reverie upon causes happiness. I came conclusion state profound peace repose, regard outward objects within soul, happiest condition man placed; although I many time joyful happy engaged bustling, energetic, active pursuits amusements, I never found joy satisfaction deep pleasant reflect upon I experienced. And I confirmed opinion I observed, indeed told himself, Peterkin's happiness also great; yet he express dancing his will not, he give much single shout, walked quietly us his eye sparkling, joyful smile upon his countenance. My reader must suppose I thought clear methodical manner I set here. These thoughts indeed pass mind, confused indefinite manner, I young time, much given deep reflections. Neither I consider peace whereof I write found world--at least perfection, although I since learned religion man may attain great degree it. I said Peterkin walked along sands us. We two ways walking together island. When travelled woods, always single file, method advanced greater facility, one treading other's footsteps. In cases Jack always took lead, Peterkin followed, I brought rear. But travelled along sands, extended almost unbroken line glistening white round island, marched abreast, found method sociable, every way pleasant. Jack, tallest, walked next sea, Peterkin marched us, arrangement either us could talk he us, Jack I happened wish converse together, could conveniently Peterkin's head. Peterkin used say, reference arrangement, he tall either us, order march might same; Jack often used scold letting everything said pass one ear other, his head could course form interruption discourse. We fairly started. Half mile's walk conveyed us round bend land shut bower view, time advanced brisk pace without speaking, though eyes idle, noted everything, woods, shore, sea, interesting. After passing ridge land formed one side valley--the Valley Wreck--we beheld another small vale lying us luxuriant loveliness tropical vegetation. We had, indeed, seen mountain-top, idea would turn much lovely close it. We commence exploration valley, Peterkin stopped us, directed attention remarkable appearance advance along shore. "What is yon, think you?" said he, levelling his spear, he expected immediate attack object question, though full half mile distant. As he spoke, appeared white column rocks, steam spray. It rose upwards height several feet, disappeared. Had near sea, would greatly surprised, might case surf, part coast coral reef approached near island parts almost joined it. There therefore lagoon between, heavy surf ocean beat almost rocks. But white column appeared fifty yards inland. The rocks place rugged, stretched across sandy beach sea. Scarce ceased expressing surprise sight, another column flew upwards seconds, far spot first seen, disappeared; so, long, irregular intervals, strange sights recurred. We quite sure columns watery composed spray, caused could guess, determined go see. In minutes gained spot, rugged precipitous, and, moreover, quite damp falling spray. We much ado pass dry-shod. The ground also full holes there. Now, stood anxiously waiting reappearance water-spouts, heard low, rumbling sound near us, quickly increased gurgling hissing noise, moment afterwards thick spout water burst upwards hole rock, spouted air much violence, close Jack I standing nearly touched us. We sprang aside, cloud spray descended, drenched us skin. Peterkin, standing farther off, escaped drops, burst uncontrollable fit laughter beholding miserable plight. "Mind eye!" he shouted eagerly, "there goes another!" The words scarcely his mouth came spout another hole, served us exactly manner before. Peterkin shrieked laughter; his merriment abruptly put stop gurgling noise occurring close he stood. "Where'll spout time, I wonder?" he said, looking anxiety, preparing run. Suddenly came loud hiss snort; fierce spout water burst Peterkin's legs, blew his feet, enveloped spray, hurled ground. He fell much violence feared he must broken his bones, ran anxiously his assistance; fortunately he fallen clump tangled herbage, he lay sprawling deplorable condition. It turn laugh; yet quite sure he unhurt, knew next spout might arise, assisted hastily jump hurry spot. I may add that, although I quite certain spout water strong, blew Peterkin completely his legs, I quite certain exact height lifted him, somewhat startled event, blinded partially spray, power observation somewhat impaired moment. "What is done now?" asked Peterkin ruefully. "Make fire, lad, dry ourselves," replied Jack. "And material ready hand," said I, picking dried branch tree, hurried woods. In hour mishap clothes dried. While hanging fire, walked beach, soon observed curious spouts took place immediately fall huge wave, never it; and, moreover, spouts take place excepting billow extremely large one. From concluded must subterraneous channel rock water driven larger waves, finding way escape except small holes, thus forced violently them. At rate, could conceive reason strange water-spouts, seemed simple probable one, forthwith adopted it. "I say, Ralph, what is water; shark?" said Jack, quit place. I immediately ran overhanging ledge rock, he looking sea, bent it. There I saw faint pale object greenish colour, seemed move slightly, I looked it. "It is like fish sort," said I. "Hallo, Peterkin!" cried Jack, "fetch spear; here is work it." But tried reach object, spear proved short. "There now," said Peterkin sneer, "you always telling long." Jack drove spear forcibly towards object, let go his hold; although seemed well aimed, he must missed, handle soon rose again; spear drawn up, pale green object exactly spot, slowly moving tail. "Very odd," said Jack. But although undoubtedly odd, although Jack us plunged spear repeatedly, could neither hit drive away, compelled continue journey without discovering was. I much perplexed strange appearance water, could get mind long time afterwards. However, I quieted resolving I would pay visit convenient season. Chapter X Make discovery many excellent roots fruits--The resources Coral Island gradually unfolded--The banyan tree--Another tree supported natural planks--Waterfowl found--A remarkable discovery, peculiar murder--We luxuriate fat land. Our examination little valley proved altogether satisfactory. We found similar trees already seen valley, also one two others different species. We also satisfaction discovering peculiar vegetable, Jack concluded must certainly he read common among South Sea islanders, named _taro_. Also found large supply yams, another root like potato appearance. As quite new us, regarded lot fortunate one, thus cast island prolific well stored necessaries life. Long afterwards found island better respects thousands islands seas. Indeed, many much richer productive; render us less grateful present good fortune. We put one roots pocket, intending use supper; hereafter. We also saw many beautiful birds here, traces four-footed animal again. Meanwhile sun began descend, returned shore, pushed round spouting rocks next valley. This valley I spoken running across entire island. It far largest beautiful yet looked upon. Here trees every shape size hue possible conceive of, many seen valleys; for, stream valley larger, mould much richer Valley Wreck, clothed luxuriant growth trees plants. Some trees dark glossy green, others rich warm hue, contrasting well pale light green, everywhere abundant. Among recognised broad dark heads bread-fruit, golden fruit; pure, silvery foliage candle-nut, several species bore strong resemblance pine; there, groups single trees, rose tall forms cocoa-nut palms, spreading abroad, waving graceful plumes high rest, superior race stately giants keeping guard luxuriant forests. Oh, enchanting scene, I thanked God created delightful spots use man. Now, gazing around us silent admiration, Jack uttered exclamation surprise, pointing object little one side us, said-- "That is banyan tree." "And what is banyan tree?" inquired Peterkin, walked towards it. "A curious one, shall see presently," replied Jack. "It called _aoa_ here, I recollect rightly, wonderful peculiarity it. What enormous one is, sure!" _"It!"_ repeated Peterkin; "why, dozens banyans here! What mean talking bad grammar? Is philosophy deserting you, Jack?" "There one tree kind," returned Jack, "as perceive examine it." And, sure enough, find supposed forest trees reality one. Its bark light colour, shining appearance, leaves lance-shaped, small, beautiful pea-green. But wonderful thing was, branches, grew stem horizontally, sent long shoots fibres ground, which, taking root, become trees, covered bark like tree itself. Many fibres descended branches various distances, thus supported natural pillars, large strong easy first distinguish offspring parent stem. The fibres sizes states advancement, pillars mentioned small cords hung take root, thin brown threads still far ground, swayed every motion wind. In short, seemed us that, space afforded it, single tree would length cover whole island. Shortly came upon another remarkable tree, which, peculiar formation afterwards proved extremely useful us, merits description. It splendid chestnut, proper name Jack know. However, quantities fine nuts upon it, put pockets. But stem wonderful part it. It rose twelve feet without branch, great thickness: contrary, remarkably slender size tree; but, make this, four five wonderful projections stem, I cannot better describe asking reader suppose five planks two inches thick three feet broad placed round trunk tree, _edges_ closely fixed it, ground branches, planks covered bark tree incorporated it. In short, natural buttresses, without stem could supported heavy umbrageous top. We found chestnuts numerous. They grew chiefly banks stream, sizes. While examining small tree kind, Jack chipped piece buttress his axe, found wood firm easily cut. He struck axe his force, soon split close tree, first, however, cut across transversely below. By means he satisfied could obtain short planks, ready sawn, size thickness desired; great discovery indeed, perhaps important yet made. We wended way back coast, intending encamp near beach, found mosquitoes troublesome forest. On way could help admiring birds flew chirped around us. Among observed pretty kind paroquet, green body, blue head, red breast; also beautiful turtle-doves, several flocks wood-pigeons. The hues many birds extremely vivid--bright green, blue, scarlet prevailing tints. We made several attempts throughout day bring one these, bow sling--not mere sport, ascertain whether good food. But invariably missed, although twice near hitting. As evening drew on, however, flock pigeons flew past. I slung stone midst venture, good fortune kill one. We startled, soon after, loud whistling noise heads; looking up, saw flock wild-ducks making coast. We watched these, observing alighted, followed came upon lovely blue lake, two hundred yards long, embosomed verdant trees. Its placid surface, reflected every leaf stem mirror, covered various species wild ducks, feeding among sedges broad-leaved water-plants floated it, numerous birds like water-hens ran fro busily margin. These one accord flew tumultuously away instant made appearance. While walking along margin observed fish water, sort could tell. Now, neared shore, Jack I said would go little way see could procure one ducks; so, directing Peterkin go straight shore kindle fire, separated, promising rejoin speedily. But find ducks, although made diligent search half-an-hour. We retrace steps, arrested one strangest sights yet beheld. Just front us, distance ten yards, grew superb tree, certainly largest yet seen island. Its trunk least five feet diameter, smooth grey bark; spreading branches clothed light green leaves, amid clusters bright yellow fruit, numerous weigh boughs great weight. This fruit seemed plum species, oblong form, good deal larger magnum-bonum plum. The ground foot tree thickly strewn fallen fruit, midst lay sleeping, every possible attitude, least twenty hogs ages sizes, apparently quite surfeited recent banquet. Jack I could scarce restrain laughter gazed coarse, fat, ill-looking animals lay groaning snoring heavily amid remains supper. "Now, Ralph," said Jack, low whisper, "put stone sling--a good big one--and let fly fat fellow his back toward you. I will try put arrow yon little pig." "Do not think better put first?" I whispered; "it seems cruel kill asleep." "If I wanted _sport,_ Ralph, I would certainly set up; want _pork,_ we will let lie. Besides, we are sure killing them; so, fire away." Thus admonished, I slung stone good aim went bang hog's flank head drum; effect causing animal start feet, frightful yell surprise, scamper away. At instant Jack's bow twanged, arrow pinned little pig ground ear. "I have missed, all," cried Jack, darting forward uplifted axe, little pig uttered loud squeal, tore arrow ground, ran away it, along whole drove, bushes disappeared, though heard screaming long afterwards distance. "That is provoking, now," said Jack, rubbing point his nose. "Very," I replied, stroking chin. "Well, must make haste rejoin Peterkin," said Jack. "It is getting late." And without remark threaded way quickly woods towards shore. When reached it, found wood laid out, fire lighted beginning kindle up, signs preparation encampment, Peterkin nowhere found. We wondered much this; Jack suggested he might gone fetch water; he gave shout let know arrived, sat upon rock, I threw jacket, seized axe, intending split one two billets wood. But I scarce moved spot when, distance, heard appalling shriek, followed chorus yells hogs, loud hurrah. "I believe," said I, "that Peterkin met hogs." "When Greek meets Greek," said Jack, soliloquising, "then comes tug of--" "Hurrah!" shouted Peterkin distance. We turned hastily towards direction whence sound came, soon descried Peterkin walking along beach towards us little pig transfixed end his long spear! "Well done, boy!" exclaimed Jack, slapping shoulder he came up; "you are best shot amongst us." "Look here, Jack!" cried Peterkin, he disengaged animal his spear. "Do recognise hole?" said he, pointing pig's ear; "and familiar arrow, eh?" "Well, I declare!" said Jack. "Of course do," interrupted Peterkin; "but, pray, restrain declarations time, let us supper, I am uncommonly hungry, I tell you; it is joke charge whole herd swine great-grandmother bristling like giant porcupine head them!" We set preparing supper; and, truly good display viands made, laid flat rock light blazing fire. There was, first all, little pig; taro-root, yam, potato, six plums; and, lastly, wood-pigeon. To Peterkin added bit sugar-cane, he cut little patch plant he found long separating us; "and," said he, "the patch somewhat square form, convinces must planted man." "Very likely," replied Jack. "From seen, I am inclined think savages must dwelt long ago." We found small difficulty making minds cook pig. None us ever cut one before, know exactly begin; besides, nothing axe with, knife forgotten. At last Jack started said-- "Do not let us waste time talking it, boys.--Hold up, Peterkin. There, lay hind-leg block wood--so;" he cut off, large portion haunch, single blow axe. "Now other--that is it." And thus cut two hind-legs, he made several deep gashes them, thrust sharp-pointed stick each, stuck blaze roast. The wood-pigeon split open, quite flat, washed clean salt water, treated similar manner. While cooking, scraped hole sand ashes fire, put vegetables, covered up. The taro-root oval shape, ten inches long four five thick. It mottled-grey colour, thick rind. We found somewhat like Irish potato, exceedingly good. The yam roundish, rough brown skin. It sweet well flavoured. The potato, surprised find, quite sweet exceedingly palatable, also plums; and, indeed, pork pigeon too, came taste them. Altogether decidedly luxurious supper enjoyed many day; Jack said out-of-sight better ever got board ship; Peterkin said he feared remain long island he would infallibly become glutton epicure: whereat Jack remarked he need fear that, he _both_ already! And so, eaten fill, forgetting finish plum, laid comfortably sleep upon couch branches, overhanging ledge coral rock. Chapter XI Effects over-eating, reflections thereon--Humble advice regarding cold water--The "horrible cry" accounted for--The curious birds called penguins--Peculiarity cocoa-nut palm--Questions formation coral islands--Mysterious footsteps--Strange discoveries sad sights. When awoke following morning, found sun already good way horizon, I came conclusion heavy supper conducive early rising. Nevertheless felt remarkably strong well, much disposed breakfast. First, however, customary morning bathe, refreshed us greatly. I often wondered much years inhabitants dear land make frequent use charming element, water. I mean way cold bathing. Of course, I perceived convenient go sea rivers winter, used Coral Island; I knew experience large washing-tub sponge form pleasant substitute. The feelings freshness, cleanliness, vigour, extreme hilarity, always followed bathes sea, even, England, ablutions wash-tub, delightful I would sooner gone without breakfast without bathe cold water. My readers forgive asking whether habit bathing thus every morning; answer "No," pardon recommending begin once. Of late years, since retiring stirring life adventure I led long foreign climes, I heard system called cold-water cure. Now, I know much system, I mean uphold it, neither I intend run down. Perhaps, reference it, I may hint may much good thing. I know not, I quite certain, may also little good thing; great delight I cold bathing course adventurous career inclines think better risk taking much content one's self little. Such opinion, derived much experience; I put readers utmost diffidence profound modesty, knowing may possibly jar feelings confidence ability know judge best fittest reference affairs. But, return digression, I humbly crave forgiveness. We advanced journey much mile so, beginning feel pleasant glow usually accompanies vigorous exercise, when, turning point revealed us new beautiful cluster islands, suddenly arrested appalling cry alarmed us nights before. But time means much alarmed us previous occasion, because, whereas time night, day; I always found, though I unable account it, daylight banishes many fears apt assail us dark. On hearing sound, Peterkin instantly threw forward his spear. "Now, be?" said he, looking round Jack. "I tell is: go pulled constant state horror astonishment, last week, sooner we are island better, notwithstanding yams lemonade, pork plums!" Peterkin's remark followed repetition cry, louder before. "It comes one islands," said Jack. "It must ghost jackass, then," said Peterkin, "for I never heard anything like." We turned eyes towards cluster islands, where, largest, observed curious objects moving shore. "Soldiers are--that is flat!" cried Peterkin, gazing utmost amazement. And, truth, Peterkin's remark seemed correct; for, distance saw them, appeared army soldiers. There stood, rank file, lines squares, marching countermarching, blue coats white trousers. While looking them, dreadful cry came water, Peterkin suggested must regiment sent massacre natives cold blood. At remark Jack laughed said-- "Why, Peterkin, penguins!" "Penguins?" repeated Peterkin. "Ay, penguins, Peterkin, penguins--nothing less big sea-birds, shall see one days, pay visit boat, I mean set building moment return bower." "So, then, dreadful yelling ghosts murdering army soldiers," remarked Peterkin, "have dwindled penguins--big sea-birds! Very good. Then I propose continue journey fast possible, lest island converted dream get completely round it." Now, continued way, I pondered much new discovery, singular appearance birds, Jack could give us slight vague account; I began long commence boat, order might go inspect narrowly. But degrees thoughts left me, I began much taken interesting peculiarities country passing through. The second night passed manner somewhat similar first, two-thirds way round island, calculated, hoped sleep night following bower. I note particularly said saw course second day, make discoveries great importance. The shore along travelled, various parts woods passed, similar already treated of. There one two observations made, however, follows:-- We saw that, many large fruit-bearing trees grew valleys, near banks streams, soil peculiarly rich, cocoa-nut palm grew every place whatsoever; hillsides, also seashore, even, already stated, coral reef itself, soil, may use name, nothing better loose sand mingled broken shells coral rock. So near sea, too, useful tree grow, many places roots washed spray breakers. Yet found trees growing thus sands quite luxuriant growing valleys, fruit good refreshing also. Besides this, I noticed summit high mountain, ascended different point first ascent, found abundance shells broken coral formations; Jack I agreed proved either island must sea, sea must island. In words, shells coral could possibly climb mountain-top, must washed upon mountain-top level sea. We pondered much; put question, "What raised island present height sea?" But could means give satisfactory reply. Jack thought might blown volcano; Peterkin said he thought must jumped accord! We also noticed, escaped us before, solid rocks island formed quite different live coral rocks shore, wonderful little insects continually working. They seemed, indeed, material--a substance like limestone; coral rocks quite full minute cells insects lived, rocks inland hard solid, without appearance cells all. Our thoughts conversations subject sometimes profound Peterkin said certainly get drowned last, even although good divers! Nevertheless allow his pleasantry similar points deter us making notes observations went along. We found several droves hogs woods, abstained killing them, sufficient present necessities. We saw also many footprints neighbourhood. Among also observed footprints smaller animal, examined much care, could form certain opinion them. Peterkin thought little dog, Jack I thought differently. We became curious matter, observed footprints lie scattered one locality, animal made wandering round irregular manner, without object view. Early forenoon third day observed footprints much numerous ever, one particular spot diverged woods regular beaten track, was, however, closely beset bushes pushed difficulty. We become anxious find animal went to, determined follow track, and, possible, clear mystery. Peterkin said, bantering tone, he sure would cleared up, usual, frightfully simple way, prove mystery all! The beaten track seemed much large formed animal itself, concluded larger animal made it, smaller one made use it. But everywhere creeping plants tangled bushes crossed path, forced way along difficulty. Suddenly, came upon open space, heard faint cry, observed black animal standing track us. "A wild-cat!" cried Jack, fitting arrow his bow, discharging hastily he missed animal, hit earth half foot one side it. To surprise wild-cat fly, walked slowly towards arrow, snuffed it. "That is comical wild-cat I ever saw!" cried Jack. "It is tame wild-cat, I think," said Peterkin, levelling his spear make charge. "Stop!" cried I, laying hand his shoulder; "I believe poor beast blind. See, strikes branches walks along. It must old one;" I hastened towards it. "Only think," said Peterkin, suppressed laugh, "of superannuated wild-cat!" We found poor cat blind, nearly so, extremely deaf, hear footsteps quite close behind it. Then sprang round, putting back tail, black hair stood end, uttered hoarse mew fuff. "Poor thing," said Peterkin, gently extending his hand, endeavouring pat cat's head. "Poor pussy; chee, chee, chee; puss, puss, puss; cheetie pussy!" No sooner cat hear sounds signs anger fled, advancing eagerly Peterkin, allowed stroked, rubbed his legs, purring loudly time, showing every symptom extreme delight. "It is wild-cat I am!" cried Peterkin, taking his arms; "it is quite tame.--Poor pussy, cheetie pussy!" We crowded around Peterkin, little surprised, and, say truth, good deal affected, sight poor animal's excessive joy. It rubbed head Peterkin's cheek, licked his chin, thrust head almost violently his neck, purred loudly I ever heard cat purr before, appeared much overpowered feelings, occasionally mewed purred almost breath. Such demonstrations joy affection led us conclude poor cat must known man before, conjectured left either accidentally design island many years ago, evincing extreme joy meeting human beings. While fondling cat talking it, Jack glanced round open space midst stood. "Hallo!" exclaimed he, "this looks something like clearing. The axe work here. Just look tree-stumps." We turned examine these, without doubt found trees cut there, also stumps broken branches; which, however, completely covered moss, bore evidence condition years. No human footprints seen either track among bushes, cat found everywhere. We determined follow track far went, Peterkin put cat down; seemed weak, mewed pitifully, he took carried his arms, minutes fell sound asleep. About ten yards farther on, felled trees became numerous, track, diverging right, followed short space banks stream. Suddenly came spot must rude bridge, stones scattered stream, bank entirely covered moss. In silent surprise expectancy continued advance, and, yards farther on, beheld, shelter bread-fruit trees, small hut cottage. I cannot hope convey readers correct idea feelings affected us witnessing unexpected sight. We stood long time silent wonder, deep melancholy stillness place quite overpowered us; length speak, subdued whispers, surrounded awful supernatural influence. Even Peterkin's voice, usually quick lively occasions, hushed now; dreariness silent, lonely, uninhabited cottage--so strange appearance, far away usual dwellings man, old, decayed, deserted aspect--that fell upon spirits like thick cloud, blotted pall cheerful sunshine filled us since commencement tour round island. The hut cottage rude simple construction. It twelve feet long ten feet broad, seven eight feet high. It one window, rather small frame window might perhaps been, empty. The door exceedingly low, formed rough boards, roof covered broad cocoa-nut plantain leaves. But every part state utmost decay. Moss green matter grew spots it. The woodwork quite perforated holes; roof nearly fallen in, appeared prevented altogether thick matting creeping-plants interlaced branches years neglect allowed cover almost entirely; thick, luxuriant branches bread-fruit trees spread it, flung deep, sombre shadow spot, guard heat light day. We conversed long whispers strange habitation ere ventured approach it; length so, was, least part, feelings awe. At first Jack endeavoured peep window, deep shadow trees already mentioned, gloom within, he could clearly discern objects; lifted latch pushed open door. We observed latch made iron, almost eaten away rust. In like condition also hinges, creaked door swung back. On entering, stood still gazed around us, much impressed dreary stillness room. But saw surprised shocked us little. There furniture apartment save little wooden stool iron pot, latter almost eaten rust. In corner farthest door low bedstead, lay two skeletons, embedded little heap dry dust. With beating hearts went forward examine them. One skeleton man, dog, extended close beside man, head resting his bosom. Now much concerned discovery, could scarce refrain tears beholding sad remains. After time began talk seen, examine around hut, order discover clue name history poor man, thus died solitude, none mourn his loss save his cat his faithful dog. But found nothing--neither book scrap paper. We found, however, decayed remnants appeared clothing, old axe. But none things bore marks kind; and, indeed, much decayed convince us lain condition found many years. This discovery accounted us tree-stump top mountain initials cut it; also patch sugar-cane traces man met course rambles island. And much saddened reflection lot poor wanderer might possibly own, many years' residence island, unless rescued visit vessel arrival natives. Having clue whatever account presence poor human lonely spot, fell conjecturing could brought there. I inclined think he shipwrecked sailor, whose vessel lost here, crew drowned except his dog cat. But Jack thought likely he run away his vessel, taken dog cat keep company. We also much occupied minds wonderful difference cat dog. For saw one perished like loving friend master's side, head resting his bosom, sought sustain prowling abroad forest, lived solitude good old age. However, conclude cat destitute affection, could forget emotions first meeting us; saw dog great deal generous love nature cat, found impossible live death master, must needs, came die, crawl his side rest head upon his lifeless breast. While thinking things, examining everything room, attracted exclamation Peterkin. "I say, Jack," said he, "here something use us." "What it?" said Jack, hastening across room. "An old pistol," replied Peterkin, holding weapon, he pulled heap broken wood rubbish lay corner. "That, indeed, might useful," said Jack, examining it, "if powder; I suspect bow sling prove serviceable." "True, I forgot that," said Peterkin; "but may well take us, flint serve strike fire sun shine." After spent hour place without discovering anything interest, Peterkin took old cat, lain contentedly asleep stool whereon he placed it, prepared take departure. In leaving hut, Jack stumbled heavily doorpost, much decayed break across, whole fabric hut seemed ready tumble ears. This put heads might well pull down, form mound skeleton. Jack, therefore, his axe, cut doorpost, which, done, brought whole hut ruins ground, thus formed grave bones poor recluse his dog. Then left spot, brought away iron pot, pistol, old axe, might much use us hereafter. During rest day pursued journey, examined end large valley, found much alike parts already described, I shall recount particulars saw place. I may, however, remark quite recover former cheerful spirits arrived bower, late evening, found everything condition left three days before. Chapter XII Something wrong tank--Jack's wisdom Peterkin's impertinence--Wonderful behaviour crab--Good wishes dwell far sea--Jack commences build little boat. Rest sweet well body mind. During long experience, amid vicissitudes chequered life, I found periods profound rest certain intervals, addition ordinary hours repose, necessary well-being man. And nature well period rest varies, according different temperaments individuals, peculiar circumstances may chance placed. To work minds, bodily labour rest. To labour body, deep sleep rest. To downcast, weary, sorrowful, joy peace rest. Nay, further, I think gay, frivolous, reckless, sated pleasures cannot last, even sorrow proves rest kind, although, perchance, better I call relief rest. There is, indeed, one class men rest denied--there rest wicked. At I hint, however, I treat rest spiritual, particularly applies mind body. Of rest stood much need return home, found exceedingly sweet indulged completing journey related. It not, indeed, long journey, nevertheless pursued diligently frames little prostrated. Our minds also much exhausted consequence many surprises, frequent alarms, much profound thought subjected; lay night return shelter bower, fell immediately deep repose. I state much certainty, Jack afterwards admitted fact, Peterkin, although he stoutly denied it, I heard snoring loudly least two minutes lying down. In condition remained night whole following day without awaking once, much moving positions. When awake near sunset, state lassitude merely rose swallow mouthful food. As Peterkin remarked, midst yawn, took breakfast tea-time, went bed again, lay following forenoon. After arose greatly refreshed, much alarmed lest lost count day. I say much alarmed head, carefully kept count days since cast upon island, order might remember Sabbath-day, day hitherto one accord kept day rest, refrained work whatsoever. However, considering subject, three entertained opinion long slept, minds put ease. We hastened Water Garden enjoy bathe, see animals I placed tank. We found garden charming, pellucid, inviting ever, Jack I plunged depth gambolled among radiant coral groves, Peterkin wallowed surface, tried occasionally kick us passed below. Having dressed, I hastened tank; surprise grief find nearly animals dead, water putrid condition! I greatly distressed this, wondered could it. "Why, precious humbug," said Peterkin, coming me, "how could expect otherwise? When fishes accustomed live Pacific Ocean, expect exist hole like that?" "Indeed, Peterkin," I replied, "there seems truth say. Nevertheless, I think it, must error reasoning; I put small animals, bear proportion pond millions fish bear ocean." "I say, Jack," cried Peterkin, waving his hand, "come here, like good fellow. Ralph actually talking philosophy. Do come assistance, he is sight beyond already!" "What is matter?" inquired Jack, coming up, he endeavoured scrub his long hair dry towel cocoa-nut cloth. I repeated thoughts Jack, who, I happy find, quite agreed me. "The best plan," he said, "will put animals first tank, add find bear them. And look here," he added, pointing sides tank, which, space two inches water-level, encrusted salt, "you must carry philosophy little further, Ralph. That water evaporated much salt anything live in. You require add _fresh_ water then, order keep degree saltness sea." "Very true, Jack; never struck before," said I. "And, I think it," continued Jack, "it seems surest way arranging tank get keep pure good condition, _imitate_ ocean it. In fact, make miniature Pacific. I do not see hope succeed unless that." "Most true," said I, pondering companion said. "But I fear difficult." "Not all," cried Jack, rolling his towel ball throwing face Peterkin, grinning winking last five minutes--"not all. Look here. There water certain saltness sea; well, fill tank sea-water, keep saltness marking height water stands sides. When evaporates little, pour _fresh_ water brook till comes mark, right, salt evaporate water. Then there is lots seaweed sea; well, go get one two bits seaweed put tank. Of course weed must alive, growing little stones; chip bit rocks weed sticking it. Then, like, throw little sand gravel tank thing's complete." "Nay, quite," said Peterkin, gravely attentive off-hand advice--"not quite; must first make three little men dive said perfect; would rather difficult, I fear, two would require philosophers. But hallo! what is this? I say, Ralph, look here. There is one crabs something uncommon. It is performing remarkable operation crab I ever saw--taking coat, I believe, going bed!" We hastily stooped tank, certainly little amused conduct one crabs still survived companions. It one common small crabs, like found running everywhere coasts England. While gazed it, observed back split away lower part body, gap thus formed came soft lump moved writhed unceasingly. This lump continued increase size appeared like bunch crab's legs; and, indeed, proved minutes be, points toes length extricated hole back, legs spread out, body followed, crab walked away quite entire, even points nipper-claws, leaving perfectly entire she will behind it, that, looked, seemed though two complete crabs instead one. "Well!" exclaimed Peterkin, drawing long breath, "I have _heard_ man jumping his skin sitting his skeleton order cool himself, I never expected _see_ crab it!" We were, truth, much amazed spectacle, observed new crab larger crab came of. It also quite soft, next morning skin hardened good she will. We came thus know crabs grow way, growing shells, always thought saw wonderful operation. Now I considered well advice Jack given preparing tank, I thought I came regard sound worthy acted on. So I forthwith put his plan execution, found answer excellently well, indeed, much beyond expectation; I found that, little experience taught proper proportion seaweed animals put certain amount water, tank needed attendance; and, moreover, I require ever afterwards renew change sea-water, add little fresh water brook, then, evaporated. I therefore concluded I suddenly conveyed, along tank, region salt sea all, little sea sea-fish would continued thrive prosper notwithstanding. This made greatly desire people world live far inland might know wonderful tank, and, materials like made conveyed them, thus enabled watch habits mysterious animals reside sea, examine eyes wonders great deep. For many days this, Peterkin Jack busily employed building little boat curious natural planks chestnut tree, I spent much time examining burning-glass marvellous operations constantly going tank. Here I saw anemones cling, like little red, yellow, green blobs jelly, rocks, put forth, were, multitude arms wait till little fish small animalcules unwarily touched them, would instantly seize them, fold arm arm around victims, engulf stomachs. Here I saw ceaseless working little coral insects whose efforts encrusted islands Pacific vast rocks surrounded enormous reefs. And I observed many insects, though extremely minute, beautiful, coming holes circle fine threads, form shuttlecock. Here I saw curious little barnacles opening hole backs constantly putting thin, feathery hand, which, I doubt not, dragged food mouths. Here, also, I saw crabs shells front bodies, she will whatever remarkably tender tails, that, order find protection them, thrust empty shells whelks, fish, grow big one, change another. But, curious all, I saw animal wonderful power, became ill, casting stomach teeth away it, getting entirely new set course months! All I saw, great deal more, means tank burning-glass; I refrain setting particulars here, I still much tell adventures befell us remained island. Chapter XII Notable discovery spouting cliffs--The mysterious green monster explained--We thrown unutterable terror idea Jack drowned--The Diamond Cave. "Come, Jack," cried Peterkin, one morning three weeks return long excursion, "let us jolly to-day, something vigorous. I am quite tired hammering hammering, hewing screwing, cutting butting, little boat ours, seems hard build Noah's ark. Let us go excursion mountain-top, hunt wild-ducks, make dash pigs. I am quite flat--flat bad ginger-beer--flat pancake; fact, I want something rouse me, toss up, were. Eh! say it?" "Well," answered Jack, throwing axe he proceed towards boat, "if that is want, I would recommend make excursion water-spouts. The last one tossed considerable height; perhaps next send higher--who knows?--if you are reasonable moderate expectations!" "Jack, dear boy," said Peterkin gravely, "you really becoming fond jesting. It is thing I do not approve of, do not give up, I fear that, mutual good, shall part." "Well then, Peterkin," replied Jack smile, "what would have?" "Have?" said Peterkin; "I would _have_ nothing. I did not say I wanted _have;_ I said I wanted _do."_ "By-the-bye," said I, interrupting conversation, "I reminded yet discovered nature yon curious appearance saw near water-spouts, journey round island. Perhaps would well go purpose." "Humph!" ejaculated Peterkin, "I know nature well enough." "What it?" said I. "It _mysterious_ nature sure!" said he, wave his hand, he rose log he sitting buckled his belt, he thrust his enormous club. "Well, then, let us away water-spouts," cried Jack, going bower his bow arrows; "and bring spear, Peterkin. It may useful." We now, made minds examine matter, sallied forth eagerly direction water-spout rocks, which, I mentioned, far present place abode. On arriving hastened edge rocks gazed sea, observed pale-green object still distinctly visible, moving tail slowly fro water. "Most remarkable!" said Jack. "Exceedingly curious!" said I. "Beats everything!" said Peterkin. "Now, Jack," he added, "you made poor figure last attempt stick object, I would advise let try it. If got heart all, I will engage send spear right core it; has not got heart, I will send spot heart ought be." "Fire away then, boy," replied Jack laugh. Peterkin immediately took spear, poised second two his head, darted like arrow sea. Down went straight centre green object, passed quite it, came immediately afterwards, pure unsullied, mysterious tail moved quietly before! "Now," said Peterkin gravely, "that brute heartless monster; I will nothing it." "I am pretty sure now," said Jack, "that merely phosphoric light; I must say, I am puzzled staying always exact spot." I also much puzzled, inclined think Jack must phosphoric light, luminous appearance seen much voyage seas. "But," said I, "there nothing hinder us diving it, sure shark." "True," returned Jack, stripping his clothes; "I will go down, Ralph, I am better diving are.--Now then, Peterkin, road!" Jack stepped forward, joined his hands his head, bent rocks, plunged sea. For second two spray caused his dive hid view; water became still, saw swimming far midst green object. Suddenly he sank it, vanished altogether sight! We gazed anxiously spot he disappeared nearly minute, expecting every moment see rise breath; fully minute appeared, still he reappear. Two minutes passed! flood alarm rushed upon soul, I considered that, acquaintance him, Jack never stayed water minute time; indeed, seldom long. "O Peterkin!" I said, voice trembled increasing anxiety, "something happened. It three minutes now." But Peterkin answer, I observed he gazing water look intense fear mingled anxiety, his face overspread deadly paleness. Suddenly he sprang his feet rushed frantic state, wringing his hands, exclaiming, "O Jack, Jack! he gone! It must shark, he gone ever!" For next five minutes I know I did; intensity feelings almost bereft senses. But I recalled Peterkin seizing shoulders staring wildly face, he exclaimed, "Ralph! Ralph! perhaps he fainted. Dive him, Ralph!" It seemed strange occur sooner. In moment I rushed edge rocks, without waiting throw garments, point spring waves, I observed something black rising green object. In another moment Jack's head rose surface, he gave wild shout, flinging back spray his locks, his will not dive. Now almost much amazed seeing reappear, well strong, first his non-appearance; for, best judgment, he nearly ten minutes water, perhaps longer, required exertion reason convince us utterly impossible mortal man retain his strength faculties. It therefore feeling akin superstitious awe I held hand assisted clamber steep rocks. But feeling affected Peterkin. No sooner Jack gain rocks seat one, panting breath, he threw his arms round his neck burst flood tears. "O Jack, Jack!" said he, "where you? What kept long?" After moments Peterkin became composed enough sit still listen Jack's explanation, although he could restrain attempting wink every two minutes me, order express his joy Jack's safety. I say he attempted wink, I bound add he succeed, his eyes much swollen weeping, his frequent attempts resulted series violent altogether idiotical contortions face, far expressing he intended. However, I knew poor fellow meant it, I smiled return, endeavoured make believe he winking. "Now, lads," said Jack, composed enough listen him, "yon green object shark; stream light issuing cave rocks. Just I made dive, I observed light came side rock sitting; I struck it, saw opening place appeared luminous within. For one instant I paused think whether I ought venture. Then I made mind, dashed it. For see, Peterkin, although I take time tell this, happened space seconds, I knew I wind enough serve bring hole surface again. Well, I point turning--for I began feel little uncomfortable place--when seemed faint light right me. I darted upwards, found head water. This relieved greatly, I felt I could take air enough enable return way I came. Then occurred I might able find way again; but, glancing downwards, mind put quite rest seeing green light streaming cave, like light seen streaming it, I saw much brighter. "At first I could scarcely see anything I gazed around me, dark; gradually eyes became accustomed it, I found I huge cave, part walls I observed side me. The ceiling also visible, I fancied I could perceive beautiful glittering objects there; farther end cave shrouded darkness. While I looking around great wonder, came head two would think I drowned; I plunged passage great hurry, rose surface, and--here I am!" When Jack concluded his recital he seen remarkable cave, I could rest satisfied till I dived see it: I did, found dark, Jack said, I could scarcely see anything. When I returned, long conversation it, I observed Peterkin lugubrious expression his countenance. "What is matter, Peterkin?" said I. "The matter?" he replied. "It is well two talking away like mermaids wonders cave, know I must content hear it, enjoying like mad dolphins. It is really bad." "I am sorry you, Peterkin, indeed I am," said Jack, "but cannot help you. If would learn dive--" "Learn fly, might well say!" retorted Peterkin sulky tone. "If would consent keep still," said I, "we would take us ten seconds." "Hum!" returned Peterkin; "suppose salamander propose 'only keep still,' he would carry blazing fire seconds, would say?" We laughed shook heads, evident nothing made Peterkin water. But could rest satisfied till seen cave; so, consultation, Jack I determined try could take torch us, set fire cavern. This found undertaking small difficulty, accomplished last following means: First, made torch inflammable nature bark certain tree, cut strips, and, twisting, cemented together kind resin gum, also obtained another tree; neither trees, however, known name Jack. This, prepared, wrapped great number plies cocoa-nut cloth, confident could get wet short time water. Then took small piece tinder, carefully treasured lest require it, said, sun fail us; also, rolled dry grass chips, which, little bow drill, like described before, made another bundle, wrapped cocoa-nut cloth. When ready, laid aside garments, exception trousers, which, know rough scraping rocks might subjected to, kept on. Then advanced edge rocks, Jack carrying one bundle, torch, I other, things producing fire. "Now do not weary us, Peterkin, gone time," said Jack; "we will sure return half-an-hour latest, however interesting cave be, may relieve mind." "Farewell!" said Peterkin, coming us look deep pretended solemnity, he shook hands kissed us cheek. "Farewell! gone I shall repose weary limbs shelter bush, meditate changefulness things earthly, special reference forsaken condition poor shipwrecked sailor boy!" So saying, Peterkin waved his hand, turned us, cast upon ground look melancholy resignation, well feigned I would thought genuine he accompanied gentle wink. We laughed, springing rocks together, plunged head first sea. We gained interior submarine cave without difficulty, and, emerging waves, supported time treading water, held two bundles heads. This order let eyes become accustomed obscurity. Then, could see sufficiently, swam shelving rock, landed safety. Having wrung water trousers, dried well could circumstances, proceeded ignite torch. This accomplished without difficulty minutes; sooner flare struck dumb wonderful objects revealed gaze. The roof cabin us seemed ten feet high, grew higher receded distance, lost darkness. It seemed made coral, supported massive columns material. Immense icicles (as appeared us) hung various places. These, however, formed ice, species limestone, seemed flow liquid form towards point each, became solid. A good many drops fell, however, rock below, formed little cones, rose meet points above. Some already met, thus saw pillars formed, first seemed us placed human architect support roof. As advanced farther in, saw floor composed material pillars; presented curious appearance ripples formed water gently ruffled wind. There several openings either hand walls seemed lead caverns; but, explore time. We also observed ceiling curiously marked many places, fretwork noble cathedral; walls, well roof, sparkled light torch, threw back gleams flashes covered precious stones. Although proceeded far cavern, come end it; obliged return speedily would otherwise done, torch nearly expended. We observe openings roof, indications places whereby light might enter; near entrance cavern stood immense mass pure white coral rock, caught threw back little light found entrance cave's mouth, thus produced, conjectured, pale-green object first attracted attention. We concluded, also, reflecting power rock gave forth dim light faintly illumined first part cave. Before diving passage extinguished small piece torch remained, left dry spot; conceiving might possibly stand need it, future time chance wet torch diving cavern. As stood minutes out, waiting till eyes became accustomed gloom, could help remarking deep, intense stillness unutterable gloom around us; and, I thought stupendous dome above, countless gems sparkled torchlight minutes before, came mind consider strange God make wonderful exquisitely beautiful works never seen all, except, indeed, chance visitors ourselves. I afterwards found many caverns among islands South Seas, larger beautiful one I described. "Now, Ralph, ready?" said Jack, low voice, seemed echo dome above. "Quite ready." "Come along, then," said he; plunging ledge rock water, dived narrow entrance. In seconds panting rocks above, receiving congratulations friend Peterkin. Chapter XIV Strange peculiarity tides--Also twilight--Peterkin's remarkable conduct embracing little pig killing big sow--Sage remarks jesting--Also love. It quite relief us breathe pure air enjoy glad sunshine long ramble Diamond Cave, named it; although stay half-an-hour away, seemed us much longer. While dressing, walk home, best satisfy curiosity poor Peterkin, seemed regret, lively sincerity, his inability dive. There help it, however, condoled best could. Had great rise fall tide seas, might perhaps found possible take us low water; tide never rose fell eighteen inches two feet, impossible. This peculiarity tide--its slight rise fall--had attracted observation till time residence island. Neither observed another curious circumstance time there. This fact tide rose fell constant regularity, instead affected changes moon country, parts world--at least parts I acquainted. Every day every night, twelve of the clock precisely, tide full; six of the clock every morning evening ebb. I speak much confidence singular circumstance, took particular note it, never found alter. Of course, I must admit, guess hour twelve midnight, I think could pretty correctly; regard twelve noon quite positive, easily found highest point sun reached sky placing certain spot whence observed sharp summit cliff resting sky, sun passed. Jack I surprised noticed first days residence here, could account much taken obvious wonders novel situation. I since learned, however, want observation sad common infirmity human nature, hundreds persons whose eyes wonderful things passing every day, nevertheless totally ignorant them. I therefore record sympathy persons, recommend course conduct I long time adopted--namely, habit forcing attention upon _all_ things go around me, taking degree interest them, whether I feel naturally not. I suggest earnestly, though humbly, I frequently come know indifference thing generally caused ignorance regard it. We much serious conversation subject tides; Jack told us, his quiet, philosophical way, tides great good world many ways, particularly way cleansing shores land, carrying filth constantly poured sea therefrom; which, Peterkin suggested, remarkably _tidy_ do. Poor Peterkin could never let slip opportunity joke, however inopportune might be: first found rather disagreeable propensity, often interrupted flow agreeable conversation--and, indeed, I cannot strongly record disapprobation tendency general--but became used last found interruption whatever; indeed, strange say, came feel necessary part enjoyment (such force habit), found sudden outbursts mirth, resulting his humorous disposition, quite natural refreshing us midst serious conversations. But I must misrepresent Peterkin. We often found, surprise, he knew many things not; I also observed things he learned experience never forgotten. From things I came length understand things opposite dissimilar themselves, united, make agreeable whole; as, example, three island, although unlike many things, united, made trio harmonious I question ever met agreeable triumvirate. There was, indeed, note discord whatever symphony played together sweet Coral Island; I persuaded owing tuned key, namely, _love!_ Yes, loved one another much fervency lived island; and, matter that, love still. And I subject, rather subject preceded it--namely, tides--I may remark another curious natural phenomenon. We found little twilight island. We distinct remembrance charming long twilight home, people think delightful part day, though part I always preferred sunrise; first landed, used sit rocky point eminence, close day's work, enjoy evening breeze; sooner sun sunk horizon became suddenly dark. This rendered necessary watch sun happened hunting; suddenly left dark woods perplexing, as, although stars shone great beauty brilliancy, could pierce thick umbrageous boughs interlaced heads. But return: told could Peterkin Diamond Cave Spouting Cliff, named locality, wending way rapidly homewards, grunt squeal borne land breeze ears. "That is ticket!" Peterkin's remarkable exclamation, he started convulsively levelled his spear. "Hist!" cried Jack; "these friends, Peterkin. They must come expressly pay friendly visit, first time seen side island." "Come along!" cried Peterkin, hurrying towards wood, Jack I followed, smiling his impatience. Another grunt half-a-dozen squeals, much louder before, came valley. At time opposite small vale lay Valley Wreck Spouting Cliff. "I say, Peterkin," cried Jack hoarse whisper. "Well, is't?" "Stay bit, man. These grunters hillside. If go stand Ralph lee yon cliff, I will cut round behind drive gorge, you will better chance picking good one. Now, mind pitch fat young pig, Peterkin," added Jack, he sprang bushes. "Will not I, just!" said Peterkin, licking his lips, took station beside cliff. "I feel quite tender affection young pigs heart. Perhaps would correct say s--" "There come!" cried I, terrific yell Jack sent whole herd screaming hill. Now Peterkin, unable hold back, crept short way steep, grassy mound, order get better view hogs came up; he raised his head summit, two little pigs, outrun companions, rushed top utmost precipitation. One brushed close past Peterkin's ear; other, unable arrest headlong flight, went, Peterkin afterwards expressed it, "bash" his arms sudden squeal, caused force blow animal, rolled violently foot mound. No sooner reached little pig recovered feet, tossed tail, fled shrieking spot. But I slung large stone it, which, fortunately well aimed, hit behind ear, felled earth. "Capital, Ralph! that is sort!" cried Peterkin, who, surprise, great relief, risen his feet apparently unhurt, though much dishevelled. He rushed franticly towards gorge, yells hogs told us approaching. I made mind I would abstain killing another, as, Peterkin successful, two sufficient wants present time. Suddenly burst forth--two three little round ones advance, enormous old sow drove hogs her heels. "Now, Peterkin," said I, "there is nice little fat one; spear it." But Peterkin move; he allowed pass unharmed. I looked surprise, saw his lips compressed his eyebrows knitted, he fight awful enemy. "What it?" I inquired, trepidation. Suddenly he levelled his spear, darted forward, and, yell nearly froze blood veins, stabbed old sow heart. Nay, vigorously done spear went one side came other! "O Peterkin," said I, going him, "what done"? _Done?_ "I have killed great-great-grandmother, that is all," said he, looking somewhat awe-struck expression transfixed animal. "Hallo! what is this?" said Jack, he came up. "Why, Peterkin, must fond tough chop. If mean eat old hog, she will try jaws, I warrant. What possessed stick _her,_ Peterkin?" "Why, fact is, I want pair shoes." "What shoes old hog?" said I, smiling. "My present shoes certainly nothing her," replied Peterkin; "nevertheless, she good deal future shoes. The fact is, I saw floor pig neatly, Ralph, struck little use killing another. Then I remembered I long wanted leather tough substance make shoes of, old grandmother seemed tough I made mind stick her, see I have done it!" "That certainly have, Peterkin," said Jack, he examining transfixed animal. We considered carry game home, for, although distance short, hog heavy. At length hit plan tying four feet together, passing spear handle them. Jack took one end his shoulder, I took mine, Peterkin carried small pig. Thus returned triumph bower, laden, Peterkin remarked, glorious spoils noble hunt. As he afterwards spoke similarly glowing terms reference supper followed, every reason believe retired night leafy beds high state satisfaction. Chapter XV Boat-building extraordinary--Peterkin tries his hand cookery, fails signally--The boat finished--Curious conversation cat matters. For many days Jack applied unremitting assiduity construction boat, length began look something like one. But thing entertain right idea difficulty involved undertaking, implements axe, bit hoop-iron, sail-needle, broken penknife. But Jack it. He disposition _will_ conquered. When he believed acting rightly, he overcame obstacles. I seen Jack, doubtful whether he right wrong, timid vacillating little girl; I honour it! As boat curiosity way, words relative manner construction may amiss. I already mentioned chestnut tree wonderful buttresses planks. This tree, then, furnished us chief part material. First all, Jack sought limb tree form size as, form keel, bend either end form stem stern-posts. Such piece, however, easy obtain; last he procured rooting small tree branch growing proper angle ten feet stem, two strong roots growing form enabled make flat-sterned boat. This placed, he procured three branching roots suitable size, he fitted keel equal distances, thus forming three strong ribs. Now squaring shaping these, cutting grooves keel, easy enough matter, work axe, use Jack become wonderfully expert; quite different affair he came nailing ribs keel, instrument capable boring large hole, nails fasten with. We were, indeed, much perplexed here; Jack length devised instrument served well. He took remainder hoop-iron beat form pipe cylinder, thick man's finger. This he means axe old rusty axe found house poor man side island. This, made red hot, bored slowly timbers; and, better retain heat, Jack shut one end filled sand. True, work slowly done, mattered not, little else do. Two holes bored timber, inch half apart, also keel, quite through. Into placed stout pegs made tree called iron-wood; and, hammered well home, timbers firmly fixed nailed iron. The gunwales, stout, fixed similar manner. But, besides wooden nails, firmly lashed stem stern-posts ribs means species cordage contrived make fibrous husk cocoa-nut. This husk tough, number threads joined together formed excellent cordage. At first tied different lengths together; clumsy awkward complication knots contrived, careful interlacing ends together twisting, make good cordage size length chose. Of course cost us much time infinite labour, Jack kept spirits grew weary, required last constructed. Planks cut chestnut trees inch thick. These dressed axe--but clumsily, axe ill adapted work. Five planks side sufficient; formed boat rounded, barrel-like shape, order little twisting planks possible, although could easily bend them, could easily twist them. Having nails rivet planks with, threw aside ordinary fashion boat-building adopted one own. The planks therefore placed other's edges, sewed together tough cordage already mentioned. They also thus sewed stem, stern, keel. Each stitch tie six inches apart, formed thus: Three holes bored upper plank three lower--the holes other, is, vertical line. Through holes cord passed, and, tied, formed powerful stitch three-ply. Besides this, placed edges planks layers cocoa-nut fibre, which, swelled wetted, would, hoped, make little vessel water-tight. But order secure end, collected large quantity pitch bread-fruit tree, which, boiled old iron pot, paid whole inside boat, and, yet hot, placed large pieces cocoa-nut cloth it, gave another coat that. Thus interior covered tough, water-tight material; exterior, uncovered, exposed swelling action water, was, hoped, likely keep boat quite dry. I may add hopes disappointed. While Jack thus engaged, Peterkin I sometimes assisted him; assistance much required, frequently went a-hunting extensive mud-flats entrance long valley lay nearest bower. Here found large flocks ducks various kinds, bearing much resemblance wild ducks country I think must same. On occasions took bow sling, often successful, though I must confess I least so. Our suppers thus pleasantly varied, sometimes profusion spread us frequently knew dainties begin. I must also add poor old cat brought home always liberal share good things, well looked after, especially Peterkin, recovered much former strength, seemed improve sight well hearing. The large flat stone, rock coral, stood front entrance bower, table. On rock spread articles possessed day shipwrecked; rock, many day afterwards, spread bountiful supply blessed Coral Island. Sometimes sat table feast consisting hot rolls--as Peterkin called newly baked bread-fruit--a roast pig, roast duck, boiled roasted yams, cocoa-nuts, taro, sweet potatoes; followed dessert plums, apples, plantains--the last large-sized delightful fruit, grew large shrub tree twelve feet high, light-green leaves enormous length breadth. These luxurious feasts usually washed cocoa-nut lemonade. Occasionally Peterkin tried devise new dish--"a conglomerate," he used say; generally turned atrocious compounds he ultimately induced give his attempts extreme disgust--not forgetting, however, point Jack his failure direct contradiction proverb he (Jack) constantly thrusting his throat--namely, "where there is there is way." For he great become cook, could means find way accomplish end. One day, Peterkin I seated beside table, dinner spread, Jack came beach, and, flinging his axe, exclaimed-- "There, lads, boat's finished last! So we have nothing shape two pair oars, may put sea soon like." This piece news threw us state great joy; for, although aware boat gradually getting near completion, taken long expect quite ready least two three weeks. But Jack wrought hard said nothing, order surprise us. "My dear fellow," cried Peterkin, "you are perfect trump. But tell us nearly ready? Will not jolly sail to-morrow, eh?" "Do not talk much, Peterkin," said Jack; "and, pray, hand bit pig." "Certainly, dear," cried Peterkin, seizing axe. "What part have? A leg, wing, piece breast--which?" "A hind leg, please," answered Jack; "and, pray, good include tail." "With heart," said Peterkin, exchanging axe his hoop-iron knife, he cut desired portion. "I am glad, dear boy, see appetite wholesale, there is chance whatever dwindling re-tail again, least, far pig concerned.--Ralph, lad, do not laugh, eh?" he added, turning suddenly severe look inquiry. "Laugh!" said I; "what at, Peterkin? Why I laugh?" Both Jack Peterkin answered inquiry laughing immoderately I induced believe I missed noticing good joke, I begged might explained me; produced repeated roars laughter, I smiled helped another slice plantain. "Well, but," continued Peterkin, "I talking sail to-morrow. Cannot one, Jack?" "No," replied Jack, "we cannot sail, I hope shall row, I intend work hard oars afternoon, and, cannot get finished sunset, we will light candle-nuts, turn hands turn bed." "Very good," said Peterkin, tossing lump pork cat, received mew satisfaction. "I will help you, I can." "Afterwards," continued Jack, "we make sail cocoa-nut cloth, rig mast, shall able sail islands, visit old friends penguins." The prospect soon position extend observations islands enjoy sail beautiful sea afforded us much delight, dinner set making oars good earnest. Jack went woods blocked roughly axe, I smoothed knife, Peterkin remained bower spinning, rather twisting, strong, thick cordage fasten boat. We worked hard rapidly, sun went down, Jack I returned bower four stout oars, required little done save slight degree polishing knife. As drew near, suddenly arrested sound voice. We little surprised this--indeed, I may almost say alarmed; for, although Peterkin undoubtedly fond talking, never time found talking himself. We listened intently, still heard sound voice, conversation. Jack motioned silent, and, advancing bower tip-toe, peeped in. The sight met gaze certainly little amusing. On top log sometimes used table sat black cat, demure expression countenance, front it, sitting ground his legs extended either side log, Peterkin. At moment saw him, he gazing intently cat's face, his nose four inches it, his hands thrust his breeches pockets. "Cat," said Peterkin, turning his head little one side, "I love you!" There pause, Peterkin awaited reply affectionate declaration. But cat said nothing. "Do hear me?" cried Peterkin sharply. "I love you--I do! Do not love me?" To touching appeal cat said "Mew" faintly. "Ah! that is right. You are jolly old rascal. Why speak once, eh?" Peterkin put forward his mouth kissed cat nose! "Yes," continued Peterkin, pause, "I love you. D'you think I would say I did not, black villain? I love I have got take care you, look you, think you, see do not die--" "Mew, me-a-w!" said cat. "Very good," continued Peterkin; "quite true, I doubt. But you have right interrupt me, sir. Hold tongue till I done speaking. Moreover, cat, I love came first time ever saw me, did not seem afraid, appeared fond me, though did not know I was not going kill you. Now brave, bold, jolly, old boy, I love it--I do!" Again pause minutes, cat looked placid, Peterkin dropped his eyes upon toes, contemplation. Suddenly he looked up. "Well, cat, thinking now? Will not speak, eh? Now tell me, do not think it is monstrous shame two scoundrels, Jack Ralph, keep us waiting supper long?" Here cat arose, put back stretched itself, yawned slightly, licked point Peterkin's nose! "Just so, old boy; you are clever fellow. I really believe brute understands me!" said Peterkin, broad grin overspread his face he drew back surveyed cat. At point Jack burst loud fit laughter. The cat uttered angry fuff fled, Peterkin sprang exclaimed-- "Bad luck you, Jack! you have nearly made heart jump body, have." "Perhaps I have," replied Jack, laughing, entered bower, "but I do not intend keep cat longer supper, I hope you will forgive me." Peterkin endeavoured turn affair laugh, I observed he blushed deeply time discovered ourselves, he seem relish allusion subject afterwards; refrained remarking ever after, though tickled us little time. After supper retired rest dream wonderful adventures little boat distant voyages upon sea. Chapter XVI The boat launched--We visit coral reef--The great breaker never goes down--Coral insects--The way coral islands made--The boat's sail--We tax ingenuity form fish-hooks--Some fish saw--And monstrous whale--Wonderful shower little fish--Water-spouts. It bright, clear, beautiful morning first launched little boat, rowed upon placid waters lagoon. Not breath wind ruffled surface deep. Not cloud spotted deep blue sky. Not sound discordant broke stillness morning, although many sounds, sweet, tiny, melodious, mingled universal harmony nature. The sun rising Pacific's ample bosom tipping mountaintops red glow. The sea shining like sheet glass, yet heaving long deep swell that, world round, indicates life ocean; bright seaweeds brilliant corals shone depths pellucid water, rowed it, like rare precious gems. Oh! sight fitted stir soul man profoundest depths, and, he owned heart all, lift heart adoration gratitude great Creator magnificent glorious universe. At first, strength delight, rowed hither thither without aim object. But effervescence spirits abated, began look us consider do. "I vote row reef," cried Peterkin. "And I vote visit islands within lagoon," said I. "And I vote both," cried Jack; "so pull away, boys." As I already said, made four oars, boat small two necessary. The extra pair reserved case accident happen others. It therefore needful two us row, third steered, means oar, relieved rowers occasionally. First landed one small islands ran it, saw nothing worthy particular notice. Then landed larger island, growing cocoa-nut trees. Not eaten anything morning, gathered nuts breakfasted. After pulled straight sea landed coral reef. This indeed novel interesting sight us. We long shore almost forgotten appearance breakers, none within lagoon; now, stood beside foam-crested billow open sea, enthusiasm sailor awakened breasts, gazed widespread ruin single magnificent breaker burst thunder feet, forgot Coral Island behind us; forgot bower calm repose scented woods; forgot passed last months, remembered nothing storms, calms, fresh breezes surging billows open sea. This huge, ceaseless breaker, I often alluded, much larger sublime object imagined be. It rose many yards level sea, could seen approaching distance reef. Slowly majestically came on, acquiring greater volume velocity advanced, assumed form clear watery arch, sparkled bright sun. On came resistless solemn majesty--the upper edge lipped gently over, fell roar seemed though heart Ocean broken crash tumultuous water, foam-clad coral reef appeared tremble beneath mighty shock! We gazed long wonderingly great sight, difficulty could tear away it. As I mentioned, wave broke many places reef scattered spray lagoon, places reef sufficiently broad elevated receive check entire force. In many places coral rocks covered vegetation--the beginning, appeared us, future islands. Thus, reef, came perceive small islands seas formed. On one part saw spray breaker washing rocks, millions little, active, busy creatures continuing work building living rampart. At another place, little high waves wash it, coral insects dead; found never work water. They faithfully completed mighty work Creator given do, dead. Again, spots ceaseless lashing sea broken dead coral pieces, cast form sand. Here sea-birds alighted, little pieces seaweed stray bits wood washed up, seeds plants carried wind, lovely blades bright green already sprung up, which, died, would increase size fertility emeralds Ocean. At places islets grown apace, shaded one two cocoa-nut trees, grew, literally, sand, constantly washed ocean spray; yet, I remarked, fruit refreshing sweet taste. Again time Jack I pondered formation large coral islands. We could understand low ones formed; larger islands cost us much consideration, yet could arrive certain conclusion subject. Having satisfied curiosity enjoyed whole day little boat, returned somewhat wearied, withal rather hungry, bower. "Now," said Jack, "as boat answers well, get mast sail made immediately." "So will," cried Peterkin, assisted drag boat high-water mark. "We will light candle set night. Hurrah, boys, pull away!" As dragged boat, observed she grated heavily her keel, sands place mingled broken coral rocks, saw portions wood scraped off. "Hallo!" cried Jack seeing this, "that will not do. Our keel worn time rate." "So will," said I, pondering deeply might prevented. But I mechanical turn naturally, I could conceive remedy save putting plate iron keel; iron, I knew done. "It seems me, Jack," I added, "that impossible prevent keel worn thus." "Impossible!" cried Peterkin. "My dear Ralph, mistaken; nothing easy." "How?" I inquired, surprise. "Why, using boat all!" replied Peterkin. "Hold impudent tongue, Peterkin," said Jack, he shouldered oars; "come along me, I will give work do. In first place, go collect cocoa-nut fibre, set work make sewing twine it--" "Please, captain," interrupted Peterkin, "I have got lots made already--more enough, little friend mine used habit saying every day dinner." "Very well," continued Jack; "then you will help Ralph collect cocoa-nut cloth, cut shape, we will make sail it. I will see getting mast gearing; let us work." And work went right busily, three days time set mast sail, necessary rigging, little boat. The sail not, indeed, handsome look at, formed number oblong patches cloth; sewed well means sail-needle, strong, chief point. Jack also overcome difficulty keel, pinning _false_ keel. This piece tough wood, length width real keel, five inches deep. He made depth boat would thereby rendered much safe, able beat wind; which, sea trade-winds blow long steadily one direction, matter great importance. This piece wood pegged firmly keel; launched boat satisfaction knowing false keel scraped off, could easily put another; whereas, real keel scraped away, could renewed without taking boat pieces, Peterkin said made his "marrow quake think upon." The mast sail answered excellently, sailed lagoon great delight, examined much interest appearance island distance. Also, gazed depths water, watched hours gambols curious bright-coloured fish among corals seaweed. Peterkin also made fishing-line, Jack constructed number hooks, good, others remarkably bad. Some hooks made iron-wood, pretty well, wood extremely hard, Jack made thick large. Fish particular. Some crooked bones fish-heads also answered purpose pretty well. But formed best serviceable hook brass finger-ring belonging Jack. It gave little trouble manufacture it. First he cut axe twisted form hook. The barb took several hours cut. He means constant sawing broken penknife. As point, hour's rubbing piece sandstone made excellent one. It would matter much time labour describe appearance multitudes fish day day drawn boat means brass hook. Peterkin always caught them--for observed he derived much pleasure fishing--while Jack I found ample amusement looking on, also gazing coral groves, baiting hook. Among fish saw, catch, porpoises sword-fish, whales sharks. The porpoises came frequently lagoon shoals, amused us little bold leaps air playful gambols sea. The sword-fish wonderful creatures; apparently ten feet length, ivory spear six eight feet long projecting noses. We often saw darting fish, doubt sometimes killed ivory swords. Jack remembered heard sword-fish attacking ship--which seemed strange indeed; often habit attacking whales, perhaps mistook ship one. This sword-fish ran vessel force drove sword quite thick planks, ship arrived harbour, long afterwards, sword found still sticking it! Sharks often appear, took care never bathe deep water without leaving one number boat give us warning, he see shark approaching. As whales, never came lagoon, frequently saw spouting deep water beyond reef. I shall never forget surprise first day I saw one huge monsters close me. We rambling reef morning, re-embark little boat return home, loud blowing sound caused us wheel rapidly round. We time see shower spray falling, flukes tail monstrous fish disappear sea hundred yards off. We waited time see he would rise again. As stood, sea seemed open feet; immense spout water sent snort high air, huge, blunt head sperm whale rose us. It large could easily taken little boat, along ourselves, mouth! It plunged slowly back sea, like large ship foundering, struck water tail forcibly sound like cannon shot. We also saw great number flying-fish, although caught none; noticed never flew water except followed bitter foe dolphin, thus endeavoured escape. But fish saw, none surprised us much used find shallow pools shower rain; account appearance, ordinary-looking small, account descended shower rain! We could account way, pools found fish quite dry shower, distance high-water mark. Jack, however, suggested seemed probable. We used often see water-spouts sea. A water-spout whirling body water, rises sea like sharp-pointed pillar. After rising good way, met long tongue, comes clouds; two joined, look something like hour-glass. The water-spout carried wind, sometimes gently, sometimes violence, sea, sometimes clouds, then, bursting asunder, descends deluge. This often happens land well sea; sometimes much damage, frequently passes gently away. Now, Jack thought little fish might perhaps carried water-spout, sent shower rain. But could certain point, yet thought likely. During delightful fishing boating excursions caught good many eels, found good eat. We also found turtles among coral rocks, made excellent soup iron kettle. Moreover, discovered many shrimps prawns, lack variety food; and, indeed, never passed week without making new interesting discovery sort other, either land sea. Chapter XVII A monster wave consequences--The boat lost found--Peterkin's terrible accident--Supplies food voyage boat--We visit Penguin Island, amazed beyond measure--Account penguins. One day, long little boat finished, sitting rocks Spouting Cliff, talking excursion intended make Penguin Island next day. "You see," said Peterkin, "it might well stupid fellow like remain leave penguins alone, would quite inconsistent characters philosophers remain longer ignorance habits customs birds; sooner go better." "Very true," said I; "there nothing I desire much closer inspection them." "And I think," said Jack, "that better remain home, Peterkin, take care cat; I am sure hogs absence, revenge killing great-grandmother recklessly." "Stay home!" cried Peterkin. "My dear fellow, would certainly lose way, get upset, I take care you." "Ah, true," said Jack gravely; "that occur me; doubt must go. Our boat require good deal ballast; say, Peterkin, carries much weight it, will not need stones go." Now, companions talking, notable event occurred, which, generally known, I shall particular recording here. While talking, I said, noticed dark line, like low cloud fog-bank, seaward horizon. The day fine one, though cloudy, gentle breeze blowing, sea rougher breaker reef higher usual. At first thought looked like thunder-cloud, good deal broken weather late, accompanied occasional peals thunder, supposed storm must approaching. Gradually, however, line seemed draw nearer without spreading sky, would certainly case storm-cloud. Still nearer came, soon saw moving swiftly towards island; sound till reached islands sea. As passed islands, observed, little anxiety, cloud white foam encircled them, burst spray air; accompanied loud roar. This led us conjecture approaching object enormous wave sea; idea large till came near ourselves. When approached outer reef, however, awe-struck unusual magnitude; sprang feet, clambered hastily highest point precipice, indefinable feeling fear. I said reef opposite Spouting Cliff near shore, front bower, considerable distance sea. Owing formation, wave reached reef latter point struck foot Spouting Cliff. The instant touched reef became aware, first time, awful magnitude. It burst completely reef points, roar seemed louder thunder; roar continued seconds, wave rolled gradually along towards cliff stood. As crest reared us, felt great danger, turned flee; late. With crash seemed shake solid rock gigantic billow fell, instantly spouting-holes sent gush water-spouts force shrieked issuing narrow vents. It seemed us earth blown water. We stunned confused shock, drenched blinded spray, knew moments whither flee shelter. At length three gained eminence beyond reach water; scene devastation met gaze looked along shore! This enormous wave burst reef, continued way across lagoon, fell sandy beach island force passed completely dashed woods, levelling smaller trees bushes headlong course. On seeing this, Jack said he feared bower must swept away, boat, beach, must utterly destroyed. Our hearts sank within us thought this, hastened round woods towards home. On reaching found, great relief mind, force wave expended reaching bower; entrance almost blocked torn-up bushes tangled heaps seaweed. Having satisfied bower, hurried spot boat left; boat there. The spot stood vacant, sign could see looking around us. "It may washed woods," said Jack, hurrying beach he spoke. Still boat seen, give despair, Peterkin called Jack said-- "Jack, friend, exceedingly sagacious wise make acquainted fact cocoa-nuts grow upon trees; good inform sort fruit growing top yonder bush? I confess ignorant, or, least, doubtful point." We looked towards bush indicated, there, surprise, beheld little boat snugly nestled among leaves. We much overjoyed this, would suffered loss rather loss boat. We found wave actually borne boat crest beach woods, launched heart bush; extremely fortunate, tossed rock tree, would dashed pieces, whereas received smallest injury. It easy matter, however, get bush sea again. This cost us two days hard labour accomplish. We also much ado clear away rubbish bower, spent nearly week constant labour ere got neighbourhood look clean orderly before; uprooted bushes seaweed lay beach formed dreadfully confused-looking mass one seen place inundation could conceive. Before leaving subject, I may mention, sake interest curious natural phenomena world, gigantic wave occurs regularly islands Pacific once, sometimes twice, year. I heard stated missionaries career seas. They could tell whether visited islands, I certainly assured occurred periodically them. After got home put rights, cleared debris inundation, turned thoughts paying penguins visit. The boat therefore overhauled repairs done. Then prepared supply provisions, intended absent least night two, perhaps longer. This took us time do, Jack busy boat, Peterkin sent woods spear hog two, search long, sometimes, ere he found them. Peterkin usually sent errand wanted pork chop (which seldom), he active could run wonderfully fast he found difficulty overtaking hogs; but, dreadfully reckless, he almost invariably tumbled stumps stones course his wild chase, seldom returned home without knocked skin his shins. Once, indeed, serious accident happened him. He morning alone, return usual time dinner. We wondered this, Peterkin always punctual dinner-hour. As supper-time drew near, began anxious him, length sallied forth search woods. For long time sought vain, little dark came upon tracks hogs, followed came brow rather steep bank precipice. Looking this, beheld Peterkin lying state insensibility foot, his cheek resting snout little pig, pinned earth spear. We dreadfully alarmed, hastened bathe his forehead water, soon satisfaction seeing revive. After carried home, he related us thing happened. "You must know," said he, "I walked forenoon, till I tired old donkey, without seeing single grunter--not much track one; I determined return empty-handed, I resolved go without dinner, and--" "What!" exclaimed Jack, "did _really_ resolve that?" "Now, Jack, hold tongue," returned Peterkin. "I say I resolved forego dinner push head small valley, I felt pretty sure discovering hogs. I soon found I right scent, I scarcely walked half mile direction small plum tree found day, squeak fell ear. 'Ho, ho,' said I, 'there go, boys;' I hurried glen. I soon started them, and, singling fat pig, ran tilt him, In seconds I him, stuck spear right his dumpy body. Just I so, I saw edge precipice, whether high low I knew not; I running pace I could stop, pig I gave howl concert went plunging together. I remembered nothing that, till I came senses found bathing temples, Ralph wringing his hands me." But although Peterkin often unfortunate way getting tumbles, he successful present occasion hunting, returned evening three nice little hogs. I also successful visit mud-flats, I killed several ducks. So that, launched loaded boat sunrise following morning, found store provisions sufficient. Part cooked night before, taking note different items, found account stand thus:-- 10 Bread-fruits (two baked, eight unbaked). 20 Yams (six roasted, rest raw). 6 Taro roots. 50 Fine large plums. 6 Cocoa-nuts, ripe. 6 Ditto, green (for drinking). 4 Large ducks two small ones (raw). 3 Cold roast pigs, stuffing. I may remark stuffing devised Peterkin specially occasion. He kept manner compounding profound secret, I cannot tell was; I say, much confidence, found atrociously bad, and, first tasting, scraped carefully threw overboard. We calculated supply would last us several days; afterwards found much required, especially regard cocoa-nuts, found large supplies wherever went. However, Peterkin remarked, better much little, knew straits might put voyage. It calm, sunny morning launched forth rowed lagoon towards outlet reef, passed two green islets guarded entrance. We experienced difficulty little danger passing surf breaker, shipped good deal water attempt; but, past billow, found floating placidly long oily swell rose fell slowly rolled wide ocean. Penguin Island lay side island mile beyond outer reef, calculated must least twenty miles distant way go. We might, indeed, shortened way coasting round island inside lagoon, going passage reef nearly opposite Penguin Island; preferred go open sea--first, adventurous, and, secondly, pleasure feeling motion deep, loved much, liable sea-sickness. "I wish breeze," said Jack. "So I," cried Peterkin, resting his oar wiping his heated brow; "pulling hard work. Oh dear, could catch hundred two gulls, tie boat long strings, make fly want them, capital would be!" "Or bore hole shark's tail, reeve rope it, eh?" remarked Jack. "But I say, seems wish going granted, comes breeze. Ship oar, Peterkin. Up mast, Ralph; I will see sail. Mind helm; look squalls!" This last speech caused sudden appearance dark-blue line horizon, which, incredibly short space time, swept us, lashing sea white foam went. We presented stern boat first violence, seconds moderated steady breeze, spread sail flew merrily waves. Although breeze died away soon afterwards, stiff lasted carried greater part way fell calm again; that, flapping sail mast told us time resume oars, much mile Penguin Island. "There go soldiers!" cried Peterkin, came sight it; "how spruce white trousers look morning! I wonder receive us kindly. D'you think hospitable, Jack?" "Do not talk, Peterkin, pull away, shall see shortly." As drew near island much amused manoeuvres appearance strange birds. They seemed different species, crests heads others none, size goose, others appeared nearly large swan. We also saw huge albatross soaring heads penguins. It followed surrounded numerous flocks sea-gulls. Having approached within yards island, low rock, vegetation bushes, lay oars gazed birds surprise pleasure, returning gaze interest. We saw soldier-like appearance owing stiff, erect manner sat short legs--"bolt-upright," Peterkin expressed it. They black heads, long sharp beaks, white breasts, bluish backs. Their wings short looked like fins fish, and, indeed, soon saw used purpose swimming water. There quills wings, sort scaly feathers, also thickly covered bodies. Their legs short, placed far back birds, land, obliged stand quite upright order keep balance; water floated like waterfowl. At first stunned clamour sea-birds kept around us, knew way look--for covered rocks thousands; but, continued gaze, observed several quadrupeds (as thought) walking midst penguins. "Pull bit," cried Peterkin, "and let us see are. They must fond noisy company, consort creatures." To surprise, found penguins gone fours, crawling among bushes feet wings, like quadrupeds. Suddenly one big old bird, sitting point near us, gazing mute astonishment, became alarmed, and, scuttling rocks, plumped fell, rather ran, sea. It dived moment, and, seconds afterwards, came water far ahead, spring, dive back sea again, could scarcely believe fish leaped sport. "That beats everything," said Peterkin, rubbing his nose, screwing his face expression exasperated amazement. "I have heard thing neither fish, flesh, fowl, I never expect live see brute three together--at once--in one! But look there!" he continued--pointing look resignation shore--"look there! there is end it. What _has_ brute got tail?" We turned look direction pointed out, saw penguin walking slowly sedately along shore egg tail. There several others, observed, burdened way; found afterwards species penguin always carried eggs so. Indeed, convenient cavity purpose, tail legs. We much impressed regularity order colony. The island seemed apportioned squares, penguin possessed one, sat stiff solemnity middle it, took slow march spaces between. Some hatching eggs, others feeding young ones manner caused us laugh little. The mother stood mound raised rock, young one stood patiently her ground. Suddenly mother raised her head uttered series discordant cackling sounds. "She is going choke," cried Peterkin. But case, although, I confess, she looked like it. In seconds she put her head opened her mouth, young one thrust beak seemed suck something her throat. Then cackling renewed, sucking continued, operation feeding carried till young one satisfied; she fed her little one could tell. "Now, look yonder!" said Peterkin excited tone; "if is not abominable piece maternal deception I ever saw! That rascally old lady penguin pitched her young one sea, there is another follow her example." This indeed seemed case, top steep rock close edge sea observed old penguin endeavouring entice her young one water; young one seemed unwilling go, and, notwithstanding enticements mother, moved slowly towards her. At last she went gently behind young bird pushed little towards water, great tenderness, much say, "Do not afraid, darling; I will not hurt you, pet!" sooner she get edge rock, stood looking pensively sea, she gave sudden violent push, sending headlong slope water, mother left scramble ashore best could. We observed many employed this, came conclusion way old penguins teach children swim. Scarcely finished making remarks this, startled dozen old birds hopping clumsy ludicrous manner towards sea. The beach sloping rock, came succeeded hopping safety, others lost balance, rolled scrambled slope helpless manner. The instant reached water, however, seemed proper element. They dived bounded utmost agility; so, diving bounding sputtering--for could fly--they went rapidly sea. On seeing this, Peterkin turned grave face us said: "It is opinion birds stark, staring mad, enchanted island. I therefore propose either put ship fly terror spot, land valorously island, sell lives dearly can." "I vote landing; pull in, lads," said Jack, giving stroke his oar made boat spin. In seconds ran boat little creek, made her fast projecting piece coral, running beach, entered ranks penguins armed cudgels spear. We greatly surprised find that, instead attacking us showing signs fear approach, curious birds move places laid hands them, merely turned eyes us solemn, stupid wonder passed. There one old penguin, however, began walk slowly towards sea, Peterkin took his head he would try interrupt progress, he ran sea brandished his cudgel face. But proved resolute old bird. It would retreat; nay, more, would cease advance, battled Peterkin bravely drove reached sea. Had Peterkin used his club he could easily felled it, doubt; he wish cruel act merely sport, he let bird escape. We spent fully three hours island watching habit curious birds, finally left them, three concluded, much consultation, wonderful creatures ever seen; further, thought probable wonderful creatures world! Chapter XVIII An awful storm consequences--Narrow escape--A rock proves sure foundation--A fearful night bright morning--Deliverance danger. It evening left island penguins. As made minds encamp night small island, whereon grew cocoa-nut trees, two miles off, lay oars energy. But danger store us anticipated. The wind carried us quickly Penguin Island freshened evening drew stiff breeze, made half distance small island, became regular gale. Although directly us prevent rowing course wished go, yet checked us much; although force sea somewhat broken island, waves soon began rise, roll broken crests small craft, she began take water, much ado keep afloat. At last wind sea together became violent found impossible make island, Jack suddenly put head boat round ordered Peterkin hoist corner sail, intending run back Penguin Island. "We shall least shelter bushes," he said, boat flew wind, "and penguins keep us company." As Jack spoke, wind suddenly shifted, blew much us forced hoist sail order beat island, change thrown much leeward it. What made matters worse gale came squalls, nearly upset. "Stand by, you," cried Jack quick, earnest tone; "be ready douse sail. I much fear will not make island all." Peterkin I much habit trusting everything Jack fallen way considering things, especially things Jack's care. We had, therefore, never doubted moment going well, little anxiety heard make remark. However, time question surmise, moment he spoke heavy squall bearing upon us; flying lee gunwale dipping occasionally waves, evident lower sail altogether. In seconds squall struck boat, Peterkin I sail moment, upset us; past half full water. This I soon baled out, Peterkin hoisted corner sail; evil Jack feared came upon us. We found quite impossible make Penguin Island. The gale carried us quickly past towards open sea, terrible truth flashed upon us swept left perish miserably small boat midst wide ocean. This idea forced strongly upon us saw nothing direction whither wind blowing us save raging billows sea; and, indeed, trembled gazed around us, beyond shelter islands, seemed though huge billows, curled masses foam, might swallow us moment. The water, also, began wash sides, I keep constantly baling, Jack could quit helm Peterkin sail instant without endangering lives. In midst distress Jack uttered exclamation hope, pointed towards low island rock lay directly ahead. It hitherto unobserved, owing dark clouds obscured sky blinding spray seemed fill whole atmosphere. As neared rock, observed quite destitute trees verdure, low sea broke completely it. In fact, nothing summit one coral formations, rose feet level water, was, stormy weather, invisible. Over island waves breaking utmost fury, hearts sank within us saw spot could thrust little boat without dashed pieces. "Show little bit sail," cried Jack, swept past weather side rock fearful speed. "Ay, ay," answered Peterkin, hoisting foot sail. Little though addition was, caused boat lie creak loudly cleft foaming waves, I expected upset every instant; I blamed Jack heart his rashness. But I injustice, although, two seconds water rushed inboard torrent, he succeeded steering us sharply round leeward side rock, water comparatively calm force breeze broken. "Out oars now, lads! that is well done. Give way!" We obeyed instantly. The oars splashed waves together. One good, hearty pull, floating comparatively calm creek narrow barely able admit boat. Here perfect safety, leaped shore fastened cable rocks, I thanked God heart deliverance great danger. But although I said safety, I suspect readers would envied position. It true lack food, drenched skin; sea foaming round us spray flying heads, completely enveloped, were, water; spot landed twelve yards diameter, spot could move without risk swept away storm. At upper end creek small hollow cave rock, sheltered us fury winds waves; rock extended sort ledge heads, prevented spray falling upon us. "Why," said Peterkin, beginning feel cheery again, "it seems got mermaid's cave; nothing water round us, earth sky, things past." Peterkin's idea inappropriate, sea roaring white foam feet, spray flying white sheets continually heads, water dripping heavily ledge like curtain front cave, seem us much like water. "Now, boys," cried Jack, "bestir yourselves, let us make comfortable.--Toss provisions, Peterkin: here, Ralph, lend hand haul boat. Look sharp." "Ay, ay, captain," cried, hastened obey, much cheered hearty manner comrade. Fortunately cave, although deep, quite dry, succeeded making much comfortable could expected. We landed provisions, wrung water garments, spread sail us carpet, and, eaten hearty meal, began feel quite cheerful. But night drew spirits sank again, daylight evidence security vanished away. We could longer see firm rock lay, stunned violence tempest raged around us. The night grew pitchy dark advanced, could see hands held eyes, obliged feel occasionally make sure safe, storm last became terrible difficult make voices audible. A slight variation wind, supposed, caused drops spray ever anon blow faces; eddy sea, mad boiling, washed little creek reached feet threatened tear away boat. In order prevent latter calamity, hauled boat farther held cable hands. Occasional flashes lightning shone ghastly glare watery curtains around us, lent additional horror scene. Yet longed dismal flashes, less appalling thick blackness succeeded them. Crashing peals thunder seemed tear skies twain, fell upon ears wild yelling hurricane gentle summer breeze; billows burst upon weather side island fancied solid rock giving way, agony clung bare ground, expecting every moment whirled away whelmed black howling sea. Oh, night terrible anxiety! one conceive feelings intense gratitude relief last saw dawn day break vapoury mists around us. For three days three nights remained rock, storm continued rage unabated fury. On morning fourth day suddenly ceased, wind fell altogether; waves still ran high dare put boat. During greater part period scarcely slept minutes time, third night slept soundly, awoke early fourth morning find sea much down, sun shining brightly clear blue sky. It light hearts launched forth little boat steered away island home, which, overjoyed find, quite visible horizon, feared blown sight altogether. As dead calm, row greater part day; towards afternoon fair breeze sprang up, enabled us hoist sail. We soon passed Penguin Island island failed reach day storm commenced; still enough provisions, anxious get home, land, great disappointment Peterkin, seemed entertain quite affection penguins. Although breeze pretty fresh several hours, reach outer reef island till nightfall, sailed hundred yards lagoon, wind died away altogether, take oars again. It late, moon stars shining brightly, arrived opposite bower leaped upon strand. So glad safe back beloved island, scarcely took time drag boat short way beach, ran see right bower. I must confess, however, joy mingled vague sort fear lest home visited destroyed absence; reaching found everything left, poor black cat curled up, sound asleep, coral table front humble dwelling. Chapter XIX Shoemaking--The even tenor way suddenly interrupted--An unexpected visit appalling battle--We become warriors, Jack proves hero. For many months continued live island uninterrupted harmony happiness. Sometimes went a-fishing lagoon, sometimes went a-hunting woods, ascended mountain-top, way variety, although Peterkin always asserted went purpose hailing ship might chance heave sight. But I certain none us wished delivered captivity, extremely happy; Peterkin used say that, young, feel loss year two. Peterkin, I said before, thirteen years age, Jack eighteen, I fifteen. But Jack tall, strong, manly his age, might easily mistaken twenty. The climate beautiful seemed perpetual summer, many fruit-trees continued bear fruit blossom year round, never wanted plentiful supply food. The hogs, too, seemed rather increase diminish, although Peterkin frequent his attacks his spear. If time failed finding drove, pay visit plum tree mentioned, always found large family asleep branches. We employed busily time making various garments cocoa-nut cloth, landed beginning ragged. Peterkin also succeeded making excellent shoes skin old hog, following manner. He first cut piece hide, oblong form, inches longer his foot. This he soaked water, wet he sewed one end it, form rough imitation part heel shoe seam is. This done, he bored row holes round edge piece skin, tough line passed. Into sewed-up part shoe he thrust his heel; then, drawing string tight, edges rose overlapped his foot round. It true great many ill-looking puckers shoes; found serviceable notwithstanding, Jack came last prefer his long boots. We also made various useful articles, added comfort, twice spoke building us house; great affection bower, withal found serviceable, determined leave it, attempt building house, climate might turn rather disagreeable useful. We often examined pistol found house side island, Peterkin wished much powder shot, would render pig-killing much easier; but, all, become expert use sling bow spear, independent deadly weapons. Diving Water Garden also continued afford us much pleasure ever; Peterkin began little expert water constant practice. As Jack me, began feel water native element, revelled much confidence comfort Peterkin said he feared would turn fish day swim leave him, adding he long time observing Jack becoming like shark every day. Whereupon Jack remarked he, Peterkin, changed fish, he would certainly turn nothing better bigger shrimp. Poor Peterkin envy us delightful excursions water, except, indeed, Jack would dive bottom Water Garden, sit rock, look make faces him. Peterkin feel envious then, often said he would give anything able that. I much amused Peterkin said this; he could seen his face he happened take short dive, he would seen Jack's far surpassed it: great difference being, however, Jack made faces purpose--Peterkin could not help it! Now, engaged occupations amusements, event occurred one day unexpected exceedingly alarming horrible. Jack I sitting, often will not do, rocks Spouting Cliff, Peterkin wringing water his garments, recently fallen accident sea--a thing he constantly doing--when attention suddenly arrested two objects appeared horizon. "What yon, think you?" I said, addressing Jack. "I cannot imagine," answered he. "I have noticed time, fancied black sea-gulls, I look I feel convinced much larger gulls." "They seem coming towards us," said I. "Hallo! what is wrong?" inquired Peterkin, coming up. "Look there," said Jack. "Whales!" cried Peterkin, shading his eyes his hand. "No--eh--_can_ boats, Jack?" Our hearts beat excitement thought seeing human faces again. "I think right, Peterkin. But seem move strangely boats," said Jack low tone, he talking himself. I noticed shade anxiety crossed Jack's countenance he gazed long intently two objects, nearing us fast. At last he sprang his feet. "They canoes, Ralph! Whether war-canoes I cannot tell; I know, natives South Sea Islands fierce cannibals, little respect strangers. We must hide land here, I earnestly hope do." I greatly alarmed Jack's speech, I confess I thought less he said earnest, anxious manner he said it; uncomfortable feelings Peterkin I followed quickly woods. "How unfortunate," said I, gained shelter bushes, "that forgotten arms!" "It matters not," said Jack; "here clubs enough spare." As he spoke, he laid his hand bundle stout poles various sizes, Peterkin's ever-busy hands formed frequent visits cliff, purpose, apparently, something do. We selected stout club according several tastes, lay behind rock, whence could see canoes approach, without seen. At first made occasional remark appearance, entered lagoon, drew near beach, ceased speak, gazed intense interest scene us. We observed foremost canoe chased other, contained women children, well men--perhaps forty souls altogether; canoe pursued contained men. They seemed number, better armed, appearance war-party. Both crews paddling might, seemed pursuers exerted overtake fugitives ere could land. In this, however, failed. The foremost canoe made beach close beneath rocks behind concealed. Their short paddles flashed like meteors water, sent constant shower spray. The foam curled prow, eyes rowers glistened black faces, strained every muscle naked bodies; relax efforts till canoe struck beach violent shock, shout defiance whole party sprang, magic, canoe shore. Three women, two carried infants arms, rushed woods; men crowded water's edge, stones hands, spears levelled, clubs brandished, resist landing enemies. The distance two canoes half mile, and, great speed going, soon passed. As pursuers neared shore, sign fear hesitation noticeable. On came like wild charger--received recked shower stones. The canoe struck, yell seemed issue throats incarnate fiends, leaped water, drove enemies beach. The battle immediately ensued frightful behold. Most men wielded clubs enormous size curious shapes, dashed other's brains. As almost entirely naked, bound, stoop, leap, run terrible hand-to-hand encounters, looked like demons human beings. I felt heart grow sick sight bloody battle, would fain turned away, species fascination seemed hold glue eyes upon combatants. I observed attacking party led extraordinary being, who, his size peculiarity, I concluded chief. His hair frizzed enormous extent, resembled large turban. It light-yellow hue, surprised much, man's body black coal, I felt convinced hair must dyed. He tattooed head foot, his face, besides tattooed, besmeared red paint, streaked white. Altogether, his yellow, turban-like hair, his Herculean black frame, his glittering eyes white teeth, he seemed terrible monster I ever beheld. He active fight, already killed four men. Suddenly yellow-haired chief attacked man quite strong large himself. He flourished heavy club something like eagle's beak point. For second two giants eyed warily, moving round round, catch disadvantage; seeing nothing gained caution, loss time might effectually turn tide battle either way, apparently made minds attack instant, for, wild shout simultaneous spring, swung heavy clubs, met loud report. Suddenly yellow-haired savage tripped, his enemy sprang forward, ponderous club swung, descend, moment savage felled ground stone hand one witnessed his chief's danger. This turning-point battle. The savages landed first turned fled towards bush, seeing fall chief. But one escaped. They overtaken felled earth. I saw, however, killed. Indeed, enemies, conquered, seemed anxious take alive; succeeded securing fifteen, bound hand foot cords, carrying woods, laid among bushes. Here left them, purpose I knew not, returned scene late battle, remnant party bathing wounds. Out forty blacks composed attacking party, twenty-eight remained alive, two sent bush hunt women children. Of party, I said, fifteen survived, lying bound helpless grass. Jack Peterkin I looked other, whispered fears savages might clamber rocks search fresh water, discover place concealment; much interested watching movements agreed remain were--and, indeed, could easily risen without exposing detection. One savages went wood, soon returned bundle firewood, little surprised see set fire means used Jack time made first fire--namely, bow drill. When fire kindled, two party went woods returned one bound men. A dreadful feeling horror crept heart thought flashed upon going burn enemies. As bore fire feelings almost overpowered me. I gasped breath, seizing club, endeavoured spring feet; Jack's powerful arm pinned earth. Next moment one savages raised his club, fractured wretched creature's skull. He must died instantly; and, strange though may seem, I confess feeling relief deed done, I knew poor savage could burned alive. Scarcely his limbs ceased quiver monsters cut slices flesh his body, and, roasting slightly fire, devoured them. Suddenly arose cry woods, seconds two savages hastened towards fire dragging three women two infants along them. One women much younger her companions, struck modesty her demeanour gentle expression her face, which, although she flattish nose thick lips others, light-brown colour, conjectured she must different race. She her companions wore short petticoats kind tippet shoulders. Their hair jet black, instead long, short curly--though woolly--somewhat like hair young boy. While gazed interest anxiety poor creatures, big chief advanced one elder females laid his hand upon child. But mother shrank him, clasping little one her bosom, uttered wail fear. With savage laugh, chief tore child her arms tossed sea. A low groan burst Jack's lips he witnessed atrocious act heard mother's shriek, she fell insensible sand. The rippling waves rolled child beach, refused party foul murder, could observe little one still lived. The young girl brought forward, chief addressed her; although heard his voice even words distinctly, course could understand he said. The girl made answer his fierce questions, saw way he pointed fire he threatened her life. "Peterkin," said Jack hoarse whisper, "have got knife?" "Yes," replied Peterkin, whose face pale death. "That do. Listen me, bidding quick.--Here small knife, Ralph.--Fly bush, cut cords bind prisoners, set free. There! quick, ere late." Jack sprang up, seized heavy short bludgeon, his strong frame trembled emotion, large drops rolled his forehead. At moment man butchered savage minutes advanced towards girl his heavy club. Jack uttered yell rang like death-shriek among rocks. With one bound he leaped precipice full fifteen feet high, savages recovered surprise, midst them; Peterkin I dashed bushes towards prisoners. With one blow his staff Jack felled man club; then, turning round look fury, he rushed upon big chief yellow hair. Had blow Jack aimed his head taken effect, huge savage would needed second stroke; he agile cat, avoided springing one side, time he swung his ponderous club head his foe. It Jack's turn leap aside, well first outburst his blind fury over, else he become easy prey his gigantic antagonist; Jack cool now. He darted his blows rapidly well, superiority his light weapon strikingly proved combat; he could easily evade blows chiefs heavy club, chief could easily evade his light one. Nevertheless, quick he, frightfully he fling mighty weapon, although Jack struck almost every blow, strokes delivered quickly wanted force effectual. It lucky Jack savages considered success chief encounter certain refrained interfering. Had doubted it, would probably ended matter felling him. But contented awaiting issue. The force chief expended wielding his club began apparent. His movements became slower, his breath hissed his clinched teeth, surprised savages drew nearer order render assistance. Jack observed movement. He felt his fate sealed, resolved cast his life upon next blow. The chiefs club descend his head. He might evaded easily, instead so, he suddenly shortened his grasp his club, rushed blow, struck his adversary right eyes his force, fell earth, crushed beneath senseless body chief. A dozen clubs flew high air, ready descend head Jack; hesitated moment, massive body chief completely covered him. That moment saved his life. Ere savages could tear chief's body away, seven number fell prostrate beneath clubs prisoners Peterkin I set free, two others fell hand. We could never accomplished enemies engrossed fight Jack chief failed observe us upon them. They still outnumbered party three; flushed victory, taken surprise dispirited fall chief. Moreover, awe-struck sweeping fury Jack, seemed lost his senses altogether, sooner shaken free chief's body he rushed midst them, three blows equalised numbers. Peterkin I flew rescue, savages followed us, less ten minutes whole opponents knocked made prisoners, bound hand foot, extended side side upon sea-shore. Chapter XX Intercourse savages--Cannibalism prevented--The slain buried survivors depart, leaving us alone Coral Island. After battle over, savages crowded round us gazed us surprise, continued pour upon us flood questions, which, wholly unintelligible, course could answer. However, way putting end it, Jack took chief (who recovered effects his wound) hand shook warmly. No sooner blacks see meant express good-will shook hands us round. After ceremony gone through, Jack went girl, never moved rock she left, continued eager spectator passed. He made signs her follow him, then, taking chief hand, conduct bower, his eye fell poor infant thrown sea still lying shore. Dropping chief's hand, he hastened towards it, and, his great joy, found still alive. We also found mother beginning recover slowly. "Here, get way," said Jack, pushing us aside, stooped poor woman endeavoured restore her; "I will soon bring her round." So saying, he placed infant her bosom laid warm cheek hers. The effect wonderful. The woman opened her eyes, felt child, looked it, cry joy clasped her arms, time endeavouring rise, purpose, apparently, rushing woods. "There, that is right," said Jack, taking chief hand. "Now, Ralph Peterkin, make women fellows follow bower. We will entertain hospitably can." In minutes savages seated ground front bower making hearty meal cold roast pig, several ducks, variety cold fish, together unlimited supply cocoa-nuts, breadfruits, yams, taro, plums; seemed quite familiar perfectly satisfied. Meanwhile, three, thoroughly knocked day's work, took good draught cocoa-nut lemonade, and, throwing beds, fell fast asleep. The savages, seems, followed example, half-an-hour whole camp buried repose. How long slept I cannot tell, I know, lay sun setting, awoke high heavens. I awoke Jack, started surprise, unable first comprehend situation. "Now then," said he, springing up, "let us see breakfast. Hallo, Peterkin, lazy fellow! long mean lie there?" Peterkin yawned heavily. "Well," said he, opening his eyes looking trouble, "if is not to-morrow morning, thinking to-day time! Hallo, Venus, come from? You seem tolerably home, anyhow! Bah! might well speak cat you--better, fact, understands me, do not." This remark called forth sight one elderly females, seated herself rock front bower, placed her child her feet, busily engaged devouring remains roast pig. By time natives outside astir, breakfast advanced state preparation. During course made sundry attempts converse natives signs, without effect. At last hit upon plan discovering names. Jack pointed his breast said "Jack" distinctly; he pointed Peterkin me, repeating names time. Then he pointed said "Jack," laying his finger breast chief, looked inquiringly his face. The chief instantly understood him, said "Tararo" twice distinctly. Jack repeated him, chief, nodding his head approvingly, said "Chuck," hearing Peterkin exploded laughter; Jack turned, frown rebuked him, saying; "I must look even indignantly I feel, Peterkin, rascal, fellows do not like laughed at." Then turning towards youngest women, seated door bower, he pointed her; whereupon chief said "Avatea," pointing towards sun, raised his finger slowly towards zenith, remained steadily minute two. "What mean, I wonder?" said Jack, looking puzzled. "Perhaps," said Peterkin, "the chief means she angel come stay while. If so, she is uncommonly black one!" We feel quite satisfied explanation, Jack went her said "Avatea." The woman smiled sadly, nodded her head, time pointing her breast sun, manner chief done. We much puzzled know could signify, way solving difficulty obliged rest content. Jack made signs natives follow him, taking his axe, he led place battle fought. Here found prisoners, passed night beach, totally forgotten us, minds full guests, ultimately overcome sleep. They seem worse exposure, however, judged hearty appetite devoured breakfast soon given them. Jack began dig hole sand, working seconds, he pointed dead bodies lay exposed beach. The natives immediately perceived he wanted, running paddles, dug hole course half-an-hour quite large enough contain bodies slain. When finished tossed dead enemies much indifference felt assured would put trouble asked so. The body yellow-haired chief last thrown in. This wretched man would recovered blow Jack felled him, and, indeed, he endeavour rise _mêlée_ followed his fall; one his enemies, happening notice action, dealt blow his club killed spot. While throw sand chief, one savages stooped him, knife, made apparently stone, cut large slice flesh his thigh. We knew he intended make use food, could repress cry horror disgust. "Come, come, blackguard!" cried Jack, starting seizing man arm, "pitch hole. Do hear?" The savage, course, understand command, he perfectly understood look disgust Jack regarded flesh, his fierce gaze he pointed towards hole. Nevertheless, he obey. Jack instantly turned Tararo made signs enforce obedience. The chief seemed understand appeal, he stepped forward, raised his club, point dashing brains his offending subject, Jack sprang forward caught his uplifted arm. "Stop," he shouted, "you blockhead! I do not want kill man." He pointed flesh hole. The chief uttered words, desired effect; man threw flesh hole, immediately filled up. This man morose, sulky disposition, time he remained island, regarded us, especially Jack, scowling visage. His name, found, Mahine. The next three four days spent savages mending canoe, damaged violent shock sustained striking shore. This canoe curious structure. It thirty feet long, high, towering stern. The timbers partly composed, fastened much way little boat put together; part seemed curious us sort outrigger, long plank, attached body canoe means two stout cross-beams. These beams kept plank parallel canoe, contact it, floated water open space between; thus forming sort double canoe. This found intended prevent upsetting canoe, narrow could maintained upright position without outrigger. We could help wondering ingenuity clumsiness contrivance. When canoe ready, assisted natives carry prisoners it, helped load provisions fruit. Peterkin also went plum tree purpose making special onslaught upon hogs, killed less six them. These baked presented friends day departure. On day Tararo made great many energetic signs us, which, much consideration, came understand proposals go away his island; desire so, shook heads decidedly. However, consoled presenting rusty axe, thought could spare, excellent one providentially washed ashore us day wrecked. We also gave piece wood names carved it, piece string hang round his neck ornament. In minutes assembled beach. Being unable speak savages, went ceremony shaking hands, expected would depart; so, Tararo went Jack rubbed noses him, he Peterkin me! Seeing mode salutation, determined conform custom, rubbed noses heartily whole party, women all! The disagreeable part process came rub noses Mahine, Peterkin afterwards said he saw his wolfish eyes glaring close his face, he felt much inclined _bang_ _rub_ his nose. Avatea last take leave us, experienced feeling real sorrow she approached bid us farewell. Besides her modest air gentle manners, she one party exhibited smallest sign regret parting us. Going Jack, she put her flat little nose rubbed, thereafter paid compliment Peterkin me. An hour later canoe sight, we, indefinable feeling sadness creeping round hearts, seated silence beneath shadow bower, meditating wonderful events last days. Chapter XXI Sagacious moral remarks regard life--A sail!--An unexpected salute--The end black cat--A terrible dive--An incautious proceeding frightful catastrophe. Life strange compound. Peterkin used say beat druggist's shop sticks; whereas first compound good bad, horrible compound utterly detestable. And indeed I consider I struck strange mixture good evil exists material earth natures. In Coral Island experienced every variety good bountiful Creator could heap us. Yet night storm seen almost, case--and altogether, doubt, case others less fortunate--all good might swept away ever. We seen rich fruit-trees waving soft air, tender herbs shooting upwards benign influence bright sun; next day seen good beautiful trees plants uprooted hurricane, crushed hurled ground destructive devastation. We lived many months clime part beautiful often wondered whether Adam Eve found Eden sweet; seen quiet solitudes paradise suddenly broken upon ferocious savages, white sands stained blood strewed lifeless forms; yet among cannibals seen many symptoms kindly nature. I pondered things much, I considered recurred memory words I read Bible--"The works God wonderful, His ways past finding out." After poor savages left us used hold long frequent conversations them, I noticed Peterkin's manner much altered. He not, indeed, jest less heartily before, he less frequently, often tone deep seriousness his manner, his words, made seem Jack he grown two years older within days. But indeed I surprised this, I reflected awful realities witnessed lately. We could means shake tendency gloom several weeks afterwards; time wore away usual good spirits returned somewhat, began think visit savages feelings akin recall terrible dream. One day enjoying Water Garden, preparatory going fishing excursion; Peterkin kept us constant supply hogs become quite tired pork, desired change. Peterkin sunning ledge rock, creeping among rocks below. Happening look up, I observed Peterkin cutting extraordinary capers making violent gesticulations us come up; I gave Jack push rose immediately. "A sail! sail!--Ralph, look; Jack, away horizon there, entrance lagoon!" cried Peterkin, scrambled rocks. "So is, schooner, too!" said Jack, he proceeded hastily dress. Our hearts thrown terrible flutter discovery, touch island doubt captain would happy give us passage civilised islands, could find ship sailing England, part Europe. Home, associations, rushed upon heart like flood; much though I loved Coral Island bower, home long, I felt I could quitted moment without sigh. With joyful anticipations hastened highest point rock near dwelling, awaited arrival vessel; perceived she making straight island, steady breeze. In less hour she close reef, she rounded backed her topsails, order survey coast. Seeing this, fearing might perceive us, three waved pieces cocoa-nut cloth air, soon satisfaction seeing beginning lower boat bustle decks meant land. Suddenly flag run peak, little cloud white smoke rose schooner's side, could guess intentions, cannon-shot came crashing bushes, carried away several cocoa-nut trees passage, burst atoms cliff yards spot stood. With feelings terror observed flag schooner's peak black, Death's-head cross-bones upon it. As gazed blank amazement, word "pirate" escaped lips simultaneously. "What done?" cried Peterkin, observed boat shoot vessel's side make entrance reef. "If take us island, either throw us overboard sport, make pirates us." I reply, looked Jack, resource emergency. He stood folded arms, his eyes fixed grave, anxious expression ground. "There one hope," said he, turning sad expression countenance Peterkin; "perhaps, all, may resort it. If villains anxious take us, soon overrun whole island. But come, follow me." Stopping abruptly his speech, Jack bounded woods, led us circuitous route Spouting Cliff. Here he halted, and, advancing cautiously rocks, glanced edge. We soon his side, saw boat, crowded armed men, touching shore. In instant crew landed, formed line, rushed bower. In seconds saw hurrying back boat, one swinging poor cat round his head tail. On reaching water's edge, he tossed far sea, joined his companions, appeared holding hasty council. "You see may expect," said Jack bitterly. "The man wantonly kill poor brute sport think little murdering fellow-creature. Now, boys, one chance left--the Diamond Cave." "The Diamond Cave!" cried Peterkin; "then chance poor one, I could dive pirates Pacific heels." "Nay, but," said I, "we take down, Peterkin, trust us." As I spoke, observed pirates scatter beach, radiate, centre, towards woods along shore. "Now, Peterkin," said Jack solemn tone, "you must make mind it, must make minds die company." "O Jack, dear friend," cried Peterkin, turning pale, "leave me; I do not believe they will think worth kill me. Go, Ralph, dive cave." "That I," answered Jack quietly, he picked stout cudgel ground.--"So now, Ralph, must prepare meet fellows. Their motto is, 'No quarter.' If manage floor coming direction, may escape woods while." "There five them," said I; "we chance." "Come, then," cried Peterkin, starting up, grasping Jack convulsively arm, "let us dive; I go." Those naturally expert water know well feelings horror overwhelm them, it, bare idea held even seconds--that spasmodic, involuntary recoil compulsory immersion connection whatever cowardice; understand amount resolution required Peterkin allow dragged depth ten feet, then, narrow tunnel, almost pitch-dark cavern. But alternative. The pirates already caught sight us, within short distance rocks. Jack I seized Peterkin arms. "Now, keep quite still; struggling," said Jack, "or lost." Peterkin made reply, stern gravity his marble features, tension his muscles, satisfied us he fully made his mind go it. Just pirates gained foot rocks, hid us moment view, bent sea, plunged together head foremost. Peterkin behaved like hero. He floated passively us like log wood, passed tunnel rose cave shorter space time I ever done before. Peterkin drew long, deep breath reaching surface, seconds standing ledge rock safety. Jack searched tinder torch always lay cave. He soon found them, and, lighting torch, revealed Peterkin's wondering gaze marvels place. But wet waste much time looking us. Our first care take clothes wring dry could. This done, proceeded examine state larder, for, Jack truly remarked, knowing long pirates might remain island. "Perhaps," said Peterkin, "they may take heads stop altogether, shall buried alive place." "Do not think, Peterkin, it is nearest thing drowned alive ever felt?" said Jack smile. "But I fear that. These villains never stay long shore. The sea home, may depend upon will not stay day two furthest." We began make arrangements spending night cavern. At various periods Jack I conveyed cocoa-nuts fruits, besides rolls cocoa-nut cloth, submarine cave, partly amusement, partly feeling might possibly driven one day take shelter savages. Little imagine first savages would drive us would white savages, perhaps countrymen. We found cocoa-nuts good condition, cooked yams, bread-fruits spoiled. We also found cloth left it, opening proved sufficient make bed; important, rock damp. Having collected together, spread bed, placed torch midst us, ate supper. It indeed strange chamber feast in; could help remarking cold, ghastly appearance walls, black water side, thick darkness beyond, sullen sound drops fell long intervals roof cavern still water, strong contrast bed supper, which, faces, lit deep red flame torch. We sat long meal, talking together subdued voices, like dismal echoes rang vault happened raise them. At last faint light came opening died away, warning us night time rest. We therefore put torch lay sleep. On awaking, time ere could collect faculties remember were, much uncertainty whether early late. We saw faint light day, could guess hour; Jack proposed he dive reconnoitre. "No, Jack," said I; "do rest here. You have enough last days. Rest now, take care Peterkin, I go see pirates about. I will careful expose myself, I will bring word short time." "Very well, Ralph," answered Jack, "please yourself, do not long; you will take advice you will go clothes, I would like fresh cocoa-nuts, climbing trees without clothes uncomfortable, say least it." "The pirates sure keep sharp look-out," said Peterkin, "so, pray, careful." "No fear," said I; "good-bye." "Good-bye," answered comrades. And words yet sounding ears, I plunged water, seconds found open air. On rising, I careful come gently breathe softly, I kept close beside rocks; I observed one near me, I crept slowly out, ascended cliff step time, till I obtained full view shore. No pirates seen--even boat gone; possible might hidden themselves, I venture boldly forward. Then occurred look sea, when, surprise, I saw pirate schooner sailing away almost hull horizon! On seeing I uttered shout joy. Then first impulse dive back tell companions good news; I checked myself, ran top cliff, order make sure vessel I saw indeed pirate schooner. I looked long anxiously her, giving vent deep sigh relief, said aloud, "Yes, she goes; villains balked prey time least." "Not sure that!" said deep voice side, moment heavy hand grasped shoulder, held vice. Chapter XXII I fall hands pirates--How treated me, I said them--The result whole ending melancholy separation unexpected gift. My heart seemed leap throat words; turning round, I beheld man immense stature fierce aspect regarding smile contempt. He white man--that say, he man European blood, though his face, long exposure weather, deeply bronzed. His dress common seaman, except he Greek skull-cap, wore broad shawl richest silk round his waist. In shawl placed two pairs pistols heavy cutlass. He wore beard moustache, which, like locks his head, short, curly, sprinkled grey hairs. "So, youngster," he said sardonic smile, I felt his grasp tighten shoulder, "the villains balked prey, they? We shall see, shall see. Now, whelp, look yonder." As he spoke, pirate uttered shrill whistle. In second two answered, pirate boat rowed round point Water Garden, came rapidly towards us. "Now, go, make fire point; hark'ee, youngster, try run away, I will send quick sure messenger you," he pointed significantly his pistols. I obeyed silence, I happened burning-glass pocket, fire speedily kindled, thick smoke ascended air. It scarcely appeared two minutes boom gun rolled sea, looking up, I saw schooner making island again. It flashed across ruse part pirates, sent vessel away, knowing would lead us suppose left altogether. But use regret now. I completely power, I stood helplessly beside pirate watching crew boat landed beach. For instant I contemplated rushing cliff sea; I saw I could accomplish, men already water. There good deal jesting success scheme, crew ascended rocks addressed man captured title captain. They ferocious set men, shaggy beards scowling brows. All armed cutlasses pistols, costumes were, trifling variations, similar captain. As I looked one other, observed low, scowling brows never unbent, even men laughed, mean, rascally expression sat face, I felt life hung hair. "But cubs?" cried one men, oath made shudder. "I will swear three, least, more." "You hear he says, whelp: dogs?" said captain. "If mean companions," said I low voice, "I will not tell you." A loud laugh burst crew answer. The pirate captain looked surprise. Then drawing pistol his belt, he cocked said, "Now, youngster, listen me. I have time waste here. If do not tell know, I will blow brains out! Where comrades?" For instant I hesitated, knowing extremity. Suddenly thought occurred me. "Villain," said I, shaking clenched fist his face, "to blow brains would make short work me, soon over; death drowning sure, agony prolonged: yet I tell face, toss yonder cliff sea, I would tell companions are, I dare try me!" The pirate captain grew white rage I spoke. "Say so?" cried he, uttering fierce oath.--"Here, lads, take legs heave in--quick!" The men, utterly silenced surprise audacity, advanced seized me, carried towards cliff I congratulated little success scheme; I knew water I safe, could rejoin Jack Peterkin cave. But hopes suddenly blasted captain crying out, "Hold on, lads, hold on! We will give taste thumb-screws throwing sharks. Away boat. Look alive! breeze freshening." The men instantly raised shoulder high, hurrying rocks, tossed bottom boat, I lay time stunned violence fall. On recovering sufficiently raise elbow, I perceived already outside coral reef, close alongside schooner, small size clipper built. I time observe much, I received severe kick side one men, ordered me, rough voice, jump aboard. Rising hastily, I clambered side. In minutes boat hoisted deck, vessel's head put close wind, Coral Island dropped slowly astern beat head sea. Immediately coming aboard, crew busily engaged working ship getting boat attend me, I remained leaning bulwarks close gangway, watching operations. I surprised find guns carronades kind vessel, appearance fast-sailing trader pirate. But I struck neatness everything. The brass work binnacle tiller, well copper belaying-pins, brightly polished come foundry. The decks pure white, smooth. The masts clean-scraped varnished except cross-trees truck, painted black. The standing running rigging perfect order, sails white snow. In short, everything, single narrow red stripe her low, black hull trucks her tapering masts, evinced amount care strict discipline would done credit ship Royal Navy. There nothing lumbering unseemly vessel, excepting, perhaps, boat, lay deck keel fore main masts. It seemed disproportionately large schooner; I saw crew amounted thirty forty men, I concluded boat held reserve case accident compelling crew desert vessel. As I said, costumes men similar captain. But head-gear differed other, wearing ordinary straw hat merchant service, others wore cloth caps red worsted night-caps. I observed arms sent below, captain retaining his cutlass single pistol folds his shawl. Although captain tallest powerful man ship, he strikingly excel many his men respect; difference ordinary observer would noticed certain degree open candour, straightforward daring, bold, ferocious expression his face, rendered less repulsive his low-browed associates, means induce belief he hero. This look was, however, indication spirit gave pre-eminence among crew desperadoes called captain. He lion-like villain, totally devoid personal fear, utterly reckless consequences, therefore terror his men, individually hated him, unitedly felt advantage head. But thoughts soon reverted dear companions I left shore, I turned towards Coral Island, far away leeward, I sighed deeply, tears polled slowly cheeks I thought I might never see more. "So you are blubbering, you, obstinate whelp?" said deep voice captain, he came gave box ear nearly felled deck. "I do not allow weakness aboard ship. So clap stopper eyes, I will give something cry for." I flushed indignation rough cruel treatment, felt giving way anger would make matters worse, I made reply, took handkerchief dried eyes. "I thought made better stuff," continued captain angrily. "I would rather mad bulldog aboard water-eyed puppy. But I will cure you, lad, introduce sharks long. Now go below, stay till I call you." As I walked forward obey, eye fell small keg standing side main-mast, word gunpowder written pencil. It immediately flashed across that, beating wind, anything floating sea would driven reef encircling Coral Island. I also recollected--for thought rapid lightning--that old companions pistol. Without moment's hesitation, therefore, I lifted keg deck tossed sea! An exclamation surprise burst captain men witnessed act mine. Striding me, uttering fearful imprecations, captain raised his hand strike me, he shouted, "Boy! whelp! mean that?" "If lower hand," said I loud voice, I felt blood rush temples, "I will tell you. Until I am dumb." The captain stepped back regarded look amazement. "Now," continued I, "I threw keg sea wind waves carry friends Coral Island, happen pistol, powder. I hope reach soon; regret keg bigger one. Moreover, pirate, said thought I made better stuff. I do not know stuff I made of--I never thought much subject--but I am quite certain this, I made stuff like shall never tame, though worst." To surprise captain, instead flying rage, smiled, thrusting his hand voluminous shawl encircled his waist, turned his heel walked aft, I went below. Here, instead rudely handled, I expected, men received shout laughter, one them, patting back, said, "Well done, lad! you are brick, I doubt turn rare cove. Bloody Bill fellow are, he is biggest cut-throat us all." "Take beer, lad," cried another, "and wet whistle speech your'n captain. If one us made it, youngster, he would whistle wet time." "Stop clapper, Jack," vociferated third. "Give boy junk meat. Do not see he is a'most going kick bucket?" "And wonder," said first speaker oath, "after tumble gave boat. I guess would broke _your_ neck got it." I indeed feel somewhat faint, owing, doubtless, combined effects ill-usage hunger; recollected I dived cave morning breakfast, near midday. I therefore gladly accepted plate boiled pork yam, handed one men locker crew seated eating dinner. But I must add zest I ate meal much abated consequence frightful oaths terrible language flowed lips godless men, even midst hilarity good-humour. The man alluded Bloody Bill seated near me, I could help wondering moody silence he maintained among his comrades. He indeed reply questions careless off-hand tone, he never volunteered remark. The difference others his taciturnity his size, he nearly, quite, large man captain. During remainder afternoon I left reflections, anything agreeable; I could banish mind threat thumb-screws, nature use I vague terrible conception. I still meditating unhappy fate, when, nightfall, one watch deck called hatchway-- "Hallo there! one tumble light cabin lamp, send boy aft captain--sharp!" "Now then, hear, youngster? captain wants you. Look alive," said Bloody Bill, raising his huge frame locker he asleep last two hours. He sprang ladder, I instantly followed him, going aft shown cabin one men, closed door me. A small silver lamp hung beam threw dim, soft light cabin, small apartment, comfortably plainly furnished. Seated camp-stool table, busily engaged examining chart Pacific, captain, looked I entered, quiet voice bade seated, he threw his pencil, rising table, stretched sofa upper end cabin. "Boy," said he, looking full face, "what name?" "Ralph Rover," I replied. "Where come from, came island? How many companions it? Answer me, now, mind tell lies." "I never tell lies." said I firmly. The captain received reply cold, sarcastic smile, bade answer his questions. I told history companions time sailed till day his visit island, taking care, however, make mention Diamond Cave. After I concluded, he silent minutes; looking up, he said, "Boy, I believe you." I surprised remark, I could imagine he believe me. However, I made reply. "And what," continued captain, "makes think schooner pirate?" "The black flag," said I, "showed are; proof wanting, I brutal treatment I received hands." The captain frowned I spoke, subduing his anger he continued, "Boy, bold. I admit treated roughly, made us lose time gave us good deal trouble. As black flag, merely joke fellows play upon people sometimes order frighten them. It humour, harm. I pirate, boy, lawful trader--a rough one, I grant you, one cannot help seas, many pirates water murderous blackguards land. I carry trade sandal-wood Feejee Islands; choose, Ralph, behave good boy, I will take along give good share profits. You see I am want honest boy like look cabin keep log superintend traffic shore sometimes. What say you, Ralph: would like become sandal-wood trader?" I much surprised explanation, good deal relieved find vessel, all, pirate; but, instead replying, I said, "If state, take island, take back?" The captain smiled he replied, "I took anger, boy, I am sorry it. I would even take back, far away it. See, is," he added, laying his finger chart, "and here--fifty miles least. It would fair men put now, interest trade." I could make reply this; so, little conversation, I agreed become one crew--at least, could reach civilised island I might put ashore. The captain assented proposition, thanking promise, I left cabin went deck feelings ought lighter, were, I could tell why, marvellously heavy uncomfortable still. Chapter XXIII Bloody Bill--Dark surmises--A strange sail, strange crew, still stranger cargo--New reasons favouring missionaries--A murderous massacre, thoughts thereon. Three weeks conversation narrated last chapter, I standing quarter-deck schooner, watching gambols shoal porpoises swam round us. It dead calm--one still, hot, sweltering days common Pacific, nature seems gone sleep, thing water air proves her still alive her long, deep breathing swell mighty sea. No cloud floated deep blue above; ripple broke reflected blue below. The sun shone fiercely sky, ball fire blazed almost equal power bosom water. So intensely still it, perfectly transparent surface deep, long swell already alluded to, might believed surrounding universe huge, blue, liquid ball, little ship one solitary material speck creation, floating midst it. No sound broke ears save soft puff porpoise, slow creak masts swayed gently swell, patter reef-points, occasional flap hanging sails. An awning covered fore parts schooner, men composing watch deck lolled sleepy indolence, overcome excessive heat. Bloody Bill, men invariably called him, standing tiller; his post present sinecure, he whiled away time alternately gazing dreamy abstraction compass binnacle, walking taffrail order spit sea. In one turns he came near I standing, and, leaning side, looked long earnestly blue wave. This man, although he always taciturn often surly, human board I slightest desire become better acquainted. The men, seeing I relish company, knowing I protégé captain, treated total indifference. Bloody Bill, true, same; his conduct every one else, peculiar reference me. Once twice I tried draw conversation, he always turned away cold monosyllables. As he leaned taffrail close beside me, I said him-- "Bill, gloomy? Why never speak one?" Bill smiled slightly he replied, "Why, I s'pose it is I hain't got nothing say!" "That is strange," said I musingly; "you look like man could think, men usually speak." "So can, youngster," rejoined Bill somewhat sternly; "and I could speak, too, I mind to, what is use speakin' here? The men open mouths curse swear, an' seem find entertainin'; I do not, I hold tongue." "Well, Bill, that is true, I would rather hear speak hear speak like men; _I_ do not swear, Bill, might talk sometimes, I think. Besides, I am weary spending day day way, without single soul say pleasant word to. I have used friendly conversation, Bill, I really would take kind would talk little then." Bill looked surprise, I thought I observed sad expression pass across his sunburned face. "An' used friendly conversation?" said Bill, looking sea; "not Coral Island, I take it." "Yes, indeed," said I energetically; "I spent many happiest months life Coral Island." And without waiting questioned, I launched glowing account happy life Jack Peterkin I spent together, related minutely every circumstance befell us island. "Boy, boy," said Bill, voice deep startled me, "this place you." "That is true," said I. "I little use board, I do not like comrades; I cannot help it, rate I hope free soon." "Free?" said Bill, looking surprise. "Yes, free," returned I; "the captain said he would put ashore trip over." "_This trip_! Hark'ee, boy," said Bill, lowering his voice, "what said captain day came aboard?" "He said he trader sandal-wood, pirate, told I would join trip he would give good share profits, put shore civilised island I chose." Bill's brows lowered savagely he muttered, "Ay, he said truth he told he sandal-wood trader, he lied when--" "Sail ho!" shouted look-out masthead. "Where away?" cried Bill, springing tiller; men, startled sudden cry, jumped gazed round horizon. "On starboard quarter, hull down, sir," answered look-out. At moment captain came deck, mounting rigging, surveyed sail glass. Then sweeping his eye round horizon, he gazed steadily particular point. "Take top-sails," shouted captain, swinging deck main-back stay. "Take top-sails," roared first mate. "Ay, ay, sir--r--r," answered men, sprang rigging went aloft like cats. Instantly bustle board hitherto quiet schooner. The top-sails taken stowed, men stood sheets halyards, captain gazed anxiously breeze rushing towards us like sheet dark blue. In seconds struck us. The schooner trembled surprise sudden onset, she fell away, bending gracefully wind, though acknowledgment her subjection, she cut waves her sharp prow like dolphin, Bill directed her course towards strange sail. In half-an-hour neared her sufficiently make she schooner, clumsy appearance her masts sails judged her trader. She evidently like appearance, instant breeze reached her she crowded sail showed us her stern. As breeze moderated little, top-sails shaken out, soon became evident--despite proverb, "A stern chase long one"--that doubled her speed would overhaul her speedily. When within mile hoisted British colours, receiving acknowledgment, captain ordered shot fired across her bows. In moment, surprise, large portion bottom boat amidships removed, hole thus exposed appeared immense brass gun. It worked swivel, elevated means machinery. It quickly loaded fired. The heavy ball struck water yards ahead chase, ricochetting air, plunged sea mile beyond it. This produced desired effect. The strange vessel backed her top-sails hove-to, ranged lay-to hundred yards off. "Lower boat," cried captain. In second boat lowered manned part crew, armed cutlasses pistols. As captain passed get it, he said, "Jump stern-sheets, Ralph; I may want you." I obeyed, ten minutes standing stranger's deck. We much surprised sight met eyes. Instead crew sailors accustomed see, fifteen blacks, standing quarter-deck regarding us looks undisguised alarm. They totally unarmed, unclothed; one two, however, wore portions European attire. One pair duck trousers much large him, stuck ungainly manner. Another wore nothing common scanty native garment round loins, black beaver hat. But ludicrous personage all, one seemed chief, tall, middle-aged man, mild, simple expression countenance, wore white cotton shirt, swallow-tailed coat, straw hat, his black, brawny legs totally uncovered knees. "Where is commander ship?" inquired captain, stepping individual. "I capin," he answered, taking his straw hat making low bow. "You!" said captain surprise. "Where come from, bound? What cargo aboard?" "We come," answered man swallowtail, "from Aitutaki; go Rarotonga. We native miss'nary ship; name de _Olive Branch_; an' cargo two tons cocoa-nuts, seventy pigs, twenty cats, de Gosp'l." This announcement received crew vessel shout laughter, which, however, peremptorily checked captain, whose expression instantly changed one severity frank urbanity he advanced towards missionary shook warmly hand. "I glad fallen you," said he, "and I wish much success missionary labours. Pray take cabin, I wish converse privately." The missionary immediately took hand, he led away I heard saying, "Me glad find trader; t'ought pirate. You like one 'bout masts." What conversation captain man I never heard, he came deck quarter hour, shaking hands cordially missionary, ordered us boat returned schooner, immediately put wind. In minutes _Olive Branch_ left far behind us. That afternoon, I dinner, I heard men talking curious ship. "I wonder," said one, "why captain looked sweet yon swallow-tailed supercargo pigs Gospels. If ordinary trader, now, he would taken many pigs he required sent ship board bottom." "Why, Dick, must new seas do not know that," cried another. "The captain cares much Gospel (an' that is precious little), he knows, everybody knows, place among southern islands ship put get she wants comfort Gospel sent to. There hundreds islands, blessed moment, might well jump straight shark's maw land without band thirty comrades armed teeth back you." "Ay," said man deep scar his right eye, "Dick's new work. But captain takes us cargo sandal-wood Feejees, he will get taste black gentry native condition. For part, I do not know I do not care Gospel them, I know islands chance get it, trade goes smooth easy; ha'nt got it, Beelzebub could hardly desire better company." "Well, ought good judge," cried another, laughing, "for you have never kept company worst life!" "Ralph Rover!" shouted voice hatchway, "captain wants you, aft." Springing ladder, I hastened cabin, pondering I went strange testimony borne men effect Gospel savage natures--testimony which, perfectly disinterested, I doubt whatever strictly true. On coming deck, I found Bloody Bill helm, alone together, I tried draw conversation. After repeating conversation forecastle missionaries, I said-- "Tell me, Bill, schooner really trader sandal-wood?" "Yes, Ralph, she is; she is really pirate. The black flag saw flying peak deception." "Then say she is trader?" asked I. "Why, that, she trades she cannot take force; she takes force she can, preference. Ralph," he added, lowering his voice, "if seen bloody deeds I witnessed done decks, would need ask pirates. But you will find soon enough. As missionaries, captain favours useful him. The South Sea Islanders incarnate fiends better tamed, missionaries men it." Our track lay several clusters small islets, among becalmed once. During part voyage watch deck look-out masthead usually vigilant, danger attacked natives (who, I learned captain's remarks, bloody deceitful tribe group), also exposed much risk multitudes coral reefs rose channels islands, surface, others feet it. Our precautions savages, I found, indeed necessary. One day becalmed among group small islands, appeared uninhabited. As want fresh water, captain sent boat ashore bring cask two. But mistaken thinking natives; scarcely drawn near shore band naked blacks rushed bush assembled beach, brandishing clubs spears threatening manner. Our men well armed, refrained showing signs hostility, rowed nearer order converse natives; I found one crew could imperfectly speak dialects language peculiar South Sea Islanders. When within forty yards shore, ceased rowing, first mate stood address multitude; instead answering us, replied shower stones, cut men severely. Instantly muskets levelled, volley fired, captain hailed us loud voice schooner, lay five six hundred yards shore. "Do not fire!" he shouted angrily. "Pull point ahead you." The men looked surprised order, uttered deep curses prepared obey, wrath roused burned revenge. Three four hesitated, seemed disposed mutiny. "Do not distress yourselves, lads," said mate, bitter smile curled his lip. "Obey orders. The captain's man take insult tamely. If Long Tom speak presently I will give sharks." The men smiled significantly pulled shore, crowded dense mass savages, amounting probably five six hundred. We rowed couple hundred yards loud roar thundered sea, big brass gun sent withering shower grape point-blank midst living mass, wide lane cut, yell, like I could imagined, burst miserable survivors fled woods. Amongst heaps dead lay sand fallen, I could distinguish mutilated forms writhing agony, ever anon one another rose convulsively mass, endeavoured stagger towards wood, ere taken steps, fell wallowed bloody sand. My blood curdled within I witnessed frightful wanton slaughter; I little time think, captain's deep voice came water towards us: "Pull ashore, lads, fill water-casks." The men obeyed silence, seemed even hard hearts shocked ruthless deed. On gaining mouth rivulet intended take water, found flowing blood, greater part slain standing banks stream, short way mouth. Many wretched creatures fallen it, found one body, carried down, jammed two rocks, staring eyeballs turned towards us, his black hair waving ripples blood-red stream. No one dared oppose landing now, carried casks pool murdered group, filled them, returned board. Fortunately, breeze sprang soon afterwards, carried us away dreadful spot; could waft away memory I seen. "And this," thought I, gazing horror captain, who, quiet look indifference, leaned upon taffrail smoking cigar contemplating fertile green islets passed like lovely picture eyes--"this man favours missionaries useful tame savages better one else it!" Then I wondered mind whether possible missionary tame _him_! Chapter XXIV Bloody Bill communicative sagacious--Unpleasant prospects--Retrospective meditations interrupted volcanic agency--The pirates negotiate Feejee chief--Various etceteras calculated surprise horrify. It many days events narrated ere I recovered little wonted spirits. I could shake feeling long time I frightful dream, sight captain filled much horror I kept his way much duties cabin would permit. Fortunately he took little notice he observe changed feelings towards him, otherwise might worse me. But I resolved I would run away first island land at, commit hospitality natives rather remain hour longer I could help pirate schooner. I pondered subject good deal, last made mind communicate intention Bloody Bill; several talks I late, I felt assured he would willingly escape possible. When I told design he shook his head. "No, no, Ralph," said he, "you must think running away here. Among groups islands might safety, tried would find jumped fryin'-pan fire." "How so, Bill?" said I; "would natives receive me?" "That would, lad; would eat too." "Eat me!" said I surprise; "I thought South Sea Islanders never ate anybody except enemies." "Humph!" ejaculated Bill. "I s'pose it was yer tender-hearted friends England put notion head. There is set soft-hearted folk home I knows do not like feelin's ruffled, tell anything do not like--that shocks them, call it--no matter true be, stop ears cry out, 'Oh, _too_ horrible! We cannot believe that!' An' say truth. They cannot believe will not believe it. Now, I believe there is thousands people England sich born drivellin' _won't-believers_ think black fellows hereaways worst eat enemy an' then, spite; whereas I know certain, many captains British American navies know well me, Feejee Islanders eat enemies one another; spite, pleasure. It is _fact_ prefer human flesh other. But do not like white men's flesh well black; say makes sick." "Why, Bill," said I, "you told would eat caught me." "So I did, I think would. I have heard say do not like white men _so well_ black; hungry would not particular. Anyhow, I am sure would kill you. You see, Ralph, I have good parts, I have visited different groups islands oftentimes trader. And thorough-going blackguards traders are; better pirates, I tell you. One captain I sailed chip better one we are now. He trading friendly chief one day, aboard his vessel. The chief swum us thing trade tied atop his head, chaps like otters water. Well, chief hard captain, would part his things. When bargainin' shook hands, chief jumped overboard swim ashore; he got forty yards ship captain seized musket shot dead. He hove anchor put sea, sailed along shore, he dropped six black fellows his rifle, remarkin' 'that would spoil trade next comers.' But, I sayin', I am ways fellows. One laws country is, every shipwrecked person happens cast ashore, he dead alive, doomed roasted eaten. There small tradin' schooner wrecked one islands lyin' harbour storm. The crew lost, three men, swam ashore. The moment landed seized natives carried woods. We knew pretty well fate would be, could help them, crew small, gone ashore would likely killed us all. We never saw three men again; heard frightful yelling dancing merrymaking night; one natives, came aboard trade us next day, told us _long pigs_, he called men, roasted eaten, bones converted sail-needles. He also said white men bad eat, people shore sick." I much shocked cast mind terrible account natives, asked Bill he would advise do. Looking round deck make sure overheard, he lowered his voice said, "There two three ways might escape, Ralph, none them's easy. If captain would sail islands near Tahiti, might run away well enough, natives Christians; an' find wherever savages take Christianity always give bloody ways, safe trusted. I never cared Christianity myself," he continued soliloquising voice, "and I do not well know means; man half eye see black critters. However, captain always keeps sharp lookout us get islands, he half suspects one two us tired his company. Then might manage cut boat adrift fine night it is watch deck, clear discovered gone.' But would run risk bein' caught blacks, I would not like try plan. But I think it, Ralph, see what is done. In meantime it is watch below, I will go turn in." Bill bade good-night, went below, comrade took his place helm; feeling desire enter conversation him, I walked aft, leaning stern, looked phosphorescent waves gurgled around rudder, streamed like flame blue light vessel's wake. My thoughts sad, I could scarce refrain tears I contrasted present wretched position happy, peaceful time I spent Coral Island dear companions. As I thought upon Jack Peterkin, anxious forebodings crossed mind, I pictured grief dismay would search every nook corner island, vain attempt discover dead body; I felt assured see sign pirate schooner boat came cave look me, would never imagine I carried away. I wondered, too, Jack would succeed getting Peterkin cave without assistance; I trembled I thought he might lose presence mind, begin kick he tunnel! These thoughts suddenly interrupted put flight bright red blaze lighted horizon southward cast crimson glow far sea. This appearance accompanied low growling sound, distant thunder, time sky us became black, hot, stifling wind blew around us fitful gusts. The crew assembled hastily deck, belief frightful hurricane pending; captain, coming deck, soon explained phenomena. "It is volcano," said he. "I knew one hereabouts, thought extinct. Up furl top-gallant sails; we will likely breeze, it is well ready." As he spoke shower began fall, quickly observed rain fine ashes. As many miles distant volcano, must carried us wind. As captain predicted, stiff breeze soon afterwards sprang up, influence speedily left volcano far behind us; greater part night could see lurid glare hear distant thunder. The shower cease fall several hours, must sailed nearly forty miles, perhaps farther. When emerged cloud, decks every part rigging completely covered thick coat ashes. I much interested this, recollected Jack often spoken many islands Pacific volcanoes, either active extinct, said whole region less volcanic, scientific men opinion islands Pacific nothing less mountain tops huge continent sunk influence volcanic agency. Three days passing volcano, found miles windward island considerable size luxuriant aspect. It consisted two mountains, seemed nearly four thousand feet high. They separated broad valley, whose thick-growing trees ascended considerable distance mountain sides; rich, level plains, meadow-land, spread round base mountains, except point immediately opposite large valley, river seemed carry trees, were, along white, sandy shore. The mountain tops, unlike Coral Island, sharp, needle-shaped, bare, sides rugged grand outline anything I yet seen seas. Bloody Bill beside island first hove sight. "Ha!" he exclaimed, "I know island well. They call Emo." "Have before, then?" I inquired. "Ay, I have, often, schooner. It Is famous island sandal-wood. We taken many cargoes already, paid them, too; savages numerous dared try take force. But captain tried cheat often, they are beginnin' like us overmuch now. Besides, men behaved ill last time here, I wonder captain afraid venture. But he is afraid nothing earthly, I believe." We soon ran inside barrier coral-reef, let go anchor six fathoms water, opposite mouth small creek, whose shores densely covered mangroves tall umbrageous trees. The principal village natives lay half mile point. Ordering boat out, captain jumped it, ordered follow him. The men, fifteen number, well armed, mate directed Long Tom ready emergencies. "Give way, lads," cried captain. The oars fell water word, boat shot schooner's side, minutes reached shore. Here, contrary expectation, met utmost cordiality Romata, principal chief island, conducted us his house gave us mats sit upon. I observed passing natives, two three thousand, totally unarmed. After short preliminary palaver, feast baked pigs various roots spread us; partook sparingly, proceeded business. The captain stated his object visiting island, regretted slight misunderstanding last visit, hoped ill-will borne either party, satisfactory trade would accomplished. Romata answered he forgotten differences them, protested he delighted see his friends again, assured every assistance cutting embarking wood. The terms afterwards agreed on, rose depart. All conversation afterwards explained Bill, understood language pretty well. Romata accompanied us board, explained great chief another island visit him, he ceremoniously entertained following day. After begging allowed introduce us, receiving permission, he sent his canoe ashore bring off. At time, he gave orders bring board his two favourites, cock paroquet. While canoe gone errand, I time regard savage chief attentively. He man immense size, massive beautifully moulded limbs figure, parts which, broad chest, muscular arms, uncovered; although lower orders generally wore clothing strip cloth called _maro_ round loins, chief, particular occasions, wrapped his person hi voluminous folds species native cloth, made bark Chinese paper-mulberry. Romata wore magnificent black beard moustache, his hair frizzed extent resembled large turban, stuck long wooden pin! I afterwards found pin served scratching head, purpose fingers short without disarranging hair. But Romata put much greater inconvenience account his hair, found he slept his head resting wooden pillow, cut hollow neck, hair sleeper might disarranged. In ten minutes canoe returned, bringing chief, certainly presented extraordinary appearance, painted one half his face red half yellow, besides ornamenting various designs black! Otherwise he much appearance Romata, though powerfully built. As chief never seen ship before, except, perchance, petty traders long intervals visit remote islands, he much taken neatness beauty fittings schooner. He particularly struck musket shown him, asked white men got hatchets hard enough cut tree barrel made! While he thus engaged, his brother chief stood aloof, talking captain, fondling superb cock little blue-headed paroquet, favourites I spoken. I observed natives walked crouching posture presence Romata. Before guests left us, captain ordered brass gun uncovered fired gratification; I every reason believe he purpose showing superior power, case natives harbour evil designs us. Romata never seen gun before, uncovered previous visits, astonishment he viewed amusing. Being desirous knowing power, he begged captain would fire it; shot put it. The chiefs directed look rock two miles sea, gun fired. In second top rock seen burst asunder, fall fragments sea. Romata delighted success shot he pointed man walking shore begged captain fire him, evidently supposing his permission quite sufficient justify captain act. He therefore surprised, little annoyed, captain refused fire native, ordered gun housed. Of things, however, afforded matter amusement savages, pleased Romata's visitor ship's pump. He never tired examining pumping water. Indeed, much he taken pump, he could prevailed return shore, sent canoe fetch his favourite stool, he seated himself, spent remainder day pumping bilge-water ship! Next day crew went ashore cut sandal-wood, captain, one two men, remained board, order ready, need be, brass gun, unhoused conspicuously elevated, capacious muzzle directed point-blank chiefs house. The men fully armed, usual; captain ordered go them, assist work. I much pleased order, freed captain's company, I could endure, gave opportunity seeing natives. As wound along single file rich, fragrant groves banana, cocoa-nut, bread-fruit, trees, I observed many plum banyan trees, I become familiar Coral Island. I noticed also large quantities taro-roots, yams, sweet potatoes growing enclosures. On turning open glade woods, came abruptly upon cluster native houses. They built chiefly bamboos, thatched large, thick leaves pandanus; many little sloping roof three sides open front, simple shelter weather could well imagined. Within around groups natives--men, women, children--who stood gaze us marched along, followed party men chief sent escort us. About half mile inland arrived spot sandal-wood grew, men set work I clambered adjoining hill observe country. About mid-day chief arrived several followers, one carried baked pig wooden platter, yams potatoes several plantain leaves, he presented men, sat shade tree dine. The chief sat dine also; but, surprise, instead feeding himself, one his wives performed office him! I seated beside Bill, asked reason this. "It beneath his dignity, I believe, feed himself," answered Bill; "but I daresay he is particular, except great occasions. They have strange custom among them, Ralph, called _tabu_, carry great lengths. If man chooses particular tree his god, fruit tree tabued him; he eats it, he sure killed his people, eaten, course, killing means eating hereaway. Then, see great mop hair chief's head? Well, he lot barbers keep order; it is law whoever touches head living chief body dead one, his hands tabued; way barbers' hands always tabued, dare not use lives, fed like big babies, are, sure enough!" "That is odd, Bill. But look there," said I, pointing man whose skin much lighter colour generality natives. "I have seen light-skinned fellows among Feejeeans. They seem quite different race." "So are," answered Bill. "These fellows come Tongan Islands, lie long way eastward. They come build big war-canoes; and, take two sometimes four years build, there is always brown-skins among black sarpents islands." "By way, Bill," said I, "your mentioning serpents reminds I seen reptile kind since I came part world." "No any," said Bill, "if ye except niggers themselves; there is none islands lizard two, sich harmless things. But I never seed myself. If there is none land, however, there is enough water, reminds wonderful brute here. But come, I will show you." So saying, Bill arose, and, leaving men still busy baked pig, led forest. After proceeding short distance, came upon small pond stagnant water. A native lad followed us, called beckoned come us. On Bill saying words I understand, boy advanced edge pond gave low, peculiar whistle. Immediately water became agitated, enormous eel thrust head surface allowed youth touch it. It twelve feet long, thick round body man's thigh. "There!" said Bill, his lip curling contempt; "what think god, Ralph? This one gods, fed dozens livin' babies already. How many it will get afore dies hard say." "Babies!" said I, incredulous look. "Ay, babies," returned Bill. "Your soft-hearted folk home would say, 'Oh, horrible! impossible!' that, go away comfortable unconcerned sayin' 'Horrible! impossible!' made lie. But I tell you, Ralph, it is _fact_. I have seed eyes last time I here, an' mayhap stop accursed place, keep sharp look-out, you will see too. They do not feed regularly livin' babies, give one treat. Bah, brute!" cried Bill disgust, giving reptile kick snout his heavy boot sent sweltering back agony loathsome pool. I thought lucky Bill, indeed us, native youth's back happened turned time; I certain poor savages come know rudely handled god, fight way back ship. As retraced steps I questioned companion subject. "How comes it, Bill, mothers allow dreadful thing done?" "Allow it? mothers _do_ it! It seems there is nothing fiendish diabolical people do. Why, islands institution called _Aréoi_, persons connected body ready wickedness mortal man devise. In fact stick nothing; one customs murder infants moment born. The mothers agree it, fathers it. And mildest ways murdering sticking body sharp splinters bamboo, strangling thumbs, burying alive stamping death sod." I felt sick heart companion recited horrors. "But it is curious fact," he continued pause, walked silence towards spot left comrades--"it is curious fact, wherever missionaries get footin' things come end once, an' savages take good singin' psalms, like Methodists." "God bless missionaries!" said I, feeling enthusiasm filled heart, I could speak difficulty. "God bless prosper missionaries till get footing every island sea!" "I would say Amen prayer, Ralph, I could," said Bill, deep, sad voice; "but would mere mockery man ask blessing others dare ask one himself. But, Ralph," he continued, "I have told half abominations I seen durin' life seas. If pull long together, lad, I will tell more; times changed much since I last, it is like you will chance seeing little long." Chapter XXV The sandal-wood party--Native children's games somewhat surprising--Desperate amusements suddenly fatally brought close--An old friend recognised--News--Romata's mad conduct. Next day wood-cutting party went ashore again, I accompanied before. During dinner-hour I wandered woods alone, disinclined food day. I rambled far I found unexpectedly sea-shore, crossed narrow neck land separated native village large bay. Here I found party islanders busy one war-canoes, almost ready launching. I stood long time watching party great interest, observed fastened timbers planks much way I seen Jack fasten little boat. But surprised immense length, I measured carefully, found hundred feet long; capacious could held three hundred men. It unwieldy outrigger enormously high stern-posts I remarked canoe came us I Coral Island. Observing boys playing games short way along beach, I resolved go watch them; I turned natives engaged busily cheerfully work, I little thought terrible event hung completion war-canoe. Advancing towards children, numerous I began think must general playground village, I sat grassy bank shade plantain tree watch them. And happier noisy crew I never seen. There least two hundred them, boys girls, clad garments glossy little black skins, except maro, strip cloth round loins boys, short petticoat kilt girls. They play game, amused different groups. One band busily engaged game exactly similar blind man's buff. Another set walking stilts, raised children three feet ground. They expert amusement, seldom tumbled. In another place I observed group girls standing together, apparently enjoying much; I went see doing, found opening eyelids fingers till eyes appeared enormous size, thrusting pieces straw upper lower lids, across eyeball, keep position! This seemed me, I must confess, foolish well dangerous amusement. Nevertheless children seemed greatly delighted hideous faces made. I pondered subject good deal, thought little children knew silly seemed grown-up people make faces, would fond it. In another place number boys engaged flying kites, I could help wondering games little savages like own, although never seen us play. But kites different many respects, every variety shape. They made thin cloth, boys raised wonderful height air means twine made cocoa-nut husk. Other games were, showed natural depravity hearts poor savages, made wish fervently missionaries might sent them. But amusement greatest number children sexes seemed take chief delight swimming diving sea, expertness exhibited truly amazing. They seemed two principal games water, one dive sort stage erected near deep part sea, chase water. Some went extraordinary depth; others skimmed along surface, rolled like porpoises, diving other, came unexpectedly pulled leg arm. They never seemed tire sport, great heat water South Seas, could remain nearly day without feeling chilled. Many children almost infants, scarce able walk; yet staggered beach, flung round, fat little black bodies fearlessly deep water, struck sea much confidence ducklings. The game I referred swimming surf. But amusement engage, children ten grey-headed men sixty, I opportunity witnessing perfection day following, I shall describe minutely. I suppose honour guest grand swimming-match got up, Romata came told captain going engage it, begged "come see." "What sort amusement surf-swimming?" I inquired Bill, walked together part shore several thousands natives assembled. "It is favourite lark 'xtr'or'nary critters," replied Bill, giving turn quid tobacco invariably bulged his left cheek. "Ye see, Ralph, fellows take water soon a'most walk, an' long anything respectably, much home sea land. Well, ye see, I s'pose found swimmin' miles sea, divin' fathoms deep, was not exciting enough, invented game swimmin' surf. Each man boy, see, got short board plank, he swims mile sea, then, gettin' top yon thunderin' breaker, come shore top it, yellin' screechin' like fiends. It is marvel they are dashed shivers coral reef, sure an' sartin' I us tried it, would not worth fluke broken anchor wave fell. But go!" As he spoke, several hundreds natives, amongst standing, uttered loud yell, rushed beach, plunged surf, carried seething foam retreating wave. At point stood, encircling coral reef joined shore, magnificent breakers, recent stiff breeze rendered larger usual, fell thunder feet multitudes lined beach. For time swimmers continued strike sea, breasting swell like hundreds black seals. Then turned, watching approaching billow, mounted white crest, laying his breast short, flat board, came rolling towards shore, careering summit mighty wave, onlookers shouted yelled excitement. Just monster wave curled solemn majesty fling bulky length upon beach, swimmers slid back trough behind; others, slipping boards, seized hands, plunging watery waste, swam repeat amusement; few, seemed reckless, continued career launched upon beach, enveloped churning foam spray. One last came crest wave manfully, landed violent bound almost spot Bill I stood. I saw his peculiar head-dress he chief tribe entertained guest. The sea-water removed nearly paint his face covered, he rose panting his feet, I recognised, surprise, features Tararo, old friend Coral Island! Tararo moment recognised me, advancing quickly, took round neck rubbed noses; effect transferring good deal moist paint his nose mine. Then, recollecting white man's mode salutation, he grasped hand shook violently. "Hallo, Ralph!" cried Bill surprise, "that chap seems taken sudden fancy you, he must old acquaintance." "Right, Bill," I replied; "he indeed old acquaintance;" I explained words he chief whose party Jack Peterkin I helped save. Tararo haying thrown away his surf-board, entered animated conversation Bill, pointing frequently course me; whereby I concluded he must telling memorable battle part taken it. When he paused, I begged Bill ask woman Avatea, I hope she might come Tararo visit. "And ask him," said I, "who she is, I persuaded she different race Feejeeans." On mention her name chief frowned darkly, seemed speak much anger. "You are right, Ralph," said Bill, chief ceased talk; "she is Feejee girl, Samoan. How she ever came place chief clearly explain, he says she taken war, he got her three years ago, an' kept her his daughter ever since. Lucky her, poor girl, else she would roasted eaten like rest." "But Tararo frown look angry?" said I. "Because girl's somewhat obstinate, like sex, an' will not marry man he wants her to. It seems chief island came visit Tararo took fancy her, she would not account, bein' already love, engaged young chief Tararo hates, she kicked desperate shindy; so, he going war-expedition his canoe, he left her think it, sayin' he would back six months so, he hoped she would not obstropolous. This happened week ago; an' Tararo says she is ready go chief returns, his bride, she will sent _long pig_." "As long pig!" I exclaimed surprise; "why, he mean that?" "He means something unpleasant," answered Bill frown. "You see blackguards eat men an' women readily eat pigs; baked pigs baked men like appearance, call men _long_ pigs. If Avatea goes fellow long pig, it is her, poor thing." "Is she island now?" I asked eagerly. "No; she is Tararo's island." "And lie!" "About fifty sixty miles south'ard this," returned Bill; "but I--" At moment startled cry "Mao! mao!--a shark! shark!" immediately followed shriek rang clear fearfully loud tumult cries arose savages water land. We turned hastily towards direction whence cry came, time observe glaring eyeballs one swimmers he tossed his arms air. Next instant he pulled waves. A canoe instantly launched, hand drowning man caught, half his body dragged maw monster, followed canoe water became shallow could scarcely swim. The crest next billow tinged red rolled towards shore. In countries world would made deep impression spectators, effect upon islanders make hurry speed sea, lest similar fate befall others; utterly reckless human life, moment suspend progress amusements. It true surf-swimming ended time somewhat abruptly, immediately proceeded games. Bill told sharks often attack surf-swimmers, frightened away immense numbers men boys water, shouting splashing make. "But," said he, "such thing seen do not frighten much. They will to-morrow next day, was not single shark Feejee Nova Zembla." After natives series wrestling boxing matches; men immense size muscle, good deal injury other, especially boxing, lower orders several chiefs priests engaged. Each bout quickly terminated, pretend scientific knowledge art, wasted time sparring, hit straight other's heads, blows delivered great force. Frequently one combatants knocked single blow; one gigantic fellow hit his adversary severely he drove skin entirely his forehead. This feat hailed immense applause spectators. During exhibitions, painful me, though I confess I could refrain beholding them, I struck beauty many figures designs tattooed persons chiefs principal men. One figure, seemed elegant, palm tree tattooed back man's leg, roots rising, were, his heel, stem ascending tendon ankle, graceful head branching upon calf. I afterwards learned process tattooing painful, takes long do, commencing age ten, continued intervals age thirty. It done means instrument made bone, number sharp teeth skin punctured. Into punctures preparation made kernel candle-nut, mixed cocoa-nut oil, rubbed, mark thus made indelible. The operation performed class men whose profession is, tattoo much time person operating bear; much, pain inflammation caused tattooing great, sometimes causing death. Some chiefs tattooed ornamental stripe legs, gave appearance clad tights; others marks round ankles insteps looked like tight-fitting elegant boots. Their faces also tattooed, breasts profusely marked every imaginable species device--muskets, dogs, birds, pigs, clubs, canoes, intermingled lozenges, squares, circles, arbitrary figures. The women tattooed much men, marks feet arms. But I must say, however objectionable strange practice may be, nevertheless good effect, took away much appearance nakedness. Next day, returning woods schooner, observed Romata rushing neighbourhood his house, apparently mad passion. "Ah!" said Bill me, "there he is his old tricks again. That is his way he gets drink. The natives make sort drink own, makes bad enough; he gets brandy he is like wild tiger. The captain, I suppose, given bottle, usual, keep good humour. After drinkin' he usually goes sleep, people know well, keep his way, fear waken him. Even babies taken ear-shot; he is waked he rushes see now, spears clubs first person he meets." It seemed present time, however, deadly weapon his way, infuriated chief raging without one. Suddenly he caught sight unfortunate man trying conceal behind tree. Bushing towards him, Romata struck terrible blow head, knocked poor man's eye also dislocated chief's finger. The wretched creature offered resistance; he even attempt parry blow. Indeed, Bill said, I found he might consider lucky escaped his life, would certainly forfeited chief possessed club tune. "Have wretched creatures law among themselves," said I, "which restrain wickedness?" "None," replied Bill. "The chiefs word law. He might kill eat dozen his subjects day nothing his pleasure, nobody would take least notice it." This ferocious deed took place within sight party wended way beach, I could observe expression faces men total indifference contempt. It seemed awful thing possible men come hardness heart callousness sight bloodshed violence; but, indeed, I began find constant exposure scenes blood slight effect upon myself, I shuddered I came think I becoming callous. I thought upon subject much night I walked deck hours watch, I came conclusion I, hated, abhorred, detested bloody deeds I witnessed within last weeks, could soon come less sensitive them, little wonder poor ignorant savages, born bred familiarity therewith, think nothing all, hold human life slight esteem! Chapter XXVI Mischief brewing--My blood made ran cold--Evil consultations wicked resolves--Bloody Bill attempts good, fails--The attack--Wholesale murder--The flight--The escape. Next morning I awoke feverish brow feeling deep depression heart, I thought unhappy fate, wretched miserable I feel. I surrounded sides human beings dreadful character, shedding blood mere pastime. On shore natives, whose practices horrible I could think without shuddering. On board none pirates blackest dye, who, although cannibals, foul murderers, blameworthy even savages, inasmuch knew better. Even Bill, I had, strange circumstances lot, formed kind intimacy, fierce his nature acquired title "Bloody" his vile companions. I felt much cast I considered subject impossibility delivery, seemed me--at least, long time come. At last, feeling utter helplessness, I prayed fervently Almighty He would deliver miserable condition; I done I felt degree comfort. When captain came deck, hour men usually started woods, I begged permit remain aboard day, I feel well; he looked angrily, ordered me, surly tone, get ready go shore usual. The fact captain humour time past. Romata he differences, high words passed them, chief threatened send fleet his war-canoes, thousand men, break burn schooner; whereupon captain smiled sarcastically, and, going chief, gazed sternly his face, he said, "I raise little finger now, big gun blow whole village atoms five minutes!" Although chief bold man, he quailed pirate's glance threat, made reply; bad feeling raised, old sores opened. I had, therefore, go wood-cutters day. Before starting, however, captain called cabin, said-- "Here, Ralph; I have got mission you, lad. That blackguard Romata dumps, nothing mollify gift; go his house give whale's teeth, compliments. Take one men speak language." I looked gift surprise, consisted six white whale's teeth, two dyed bright red, seemed paltry things. However, I dare hesitate ask questions; so, gathering up, I left cabin, soon way chiefs house, accompanied Bill. On expressing surprise gift, he said--"They are paltry enough me, Ralph, they are considered great value chaps. They are sort cash among them. The red ones prized, one bein' equal twenty white ones. I suppose reason bein' valuable are not many them, they are hard got." On arriving house, found Romata sitting mat, midst number large bales native cloth articles, brought presents time time inferior chiefs. He received us rather haughtily; Bill explaining nature errand, he became condescending, his eyes glistened satisfaction he received whale's teeth, although he laid aside assumption kingly indifference. "Go," said he, wave hand--"go tell captain he may cut wood to-day, to-morrow. He must come ashore; I want palaver him." As left house return woods, Bill shook his head. "There is mischief brewin' black rascal's head. I know old. But comes here?" As he spoke, heard sound laughter shouting wood, presently issued band savages, midst number men bearing burdens shoulders. At first I thought burdens poles something rolled round them, end pole resting man's shoulder; nearer approach I saw human beings, tied hand foot, lashed poles could move. I counted twenty passed. "More murder!" said Bill, voice sounded hoarse laugh groan. "Surely going murder them?" said I, looking anxiously Bill's face. "I do not know, Ralph," replied Bill, "what they are going them; I fear mean good tie fellows way." As continued way towards wood-cutters, I observed Bill looked anxiously his shoulder direction procession disappeared. At last he stopped, turning abruptly his heel, said-- "I tell ye is, Ralph: I must bottom affair. Let us follow black scoundrels see they are going do." I must say I wish pry bloody practices; Bill seemed bent it, I turned went. We passed rapidly bush, guided right direction shouts savages. Suddenly dead silence, continued time, Bill I involuntarily quickened pace running top speed across narrow neck land previously mentioned. As reached verge wood, discovered savages surrounding large war-canoe, apparently point launching. Suddenly multitude put united strength canoe; scarcely huge machine begun move, yell, appalling ever fell upon ear, rose high shouting savages. It died away another another smote upon throbbing ear; I saw inhuman monsters actually launching canoe living bodies victims. But pity breasts men. Forward went ruthless indifference, shouting went, high voices rang dying shrieks wretched creatures, as, one another, ponderous canoe passed them, burst eyeballs sockets, sent life-blood gushing mouths. O reader, fiction. I would not, sake thrilling horror, invent terrible scene. It witnessed. It true--true accursed sin rendered human heart capable diabolical enormities! When over, I turned round fell upon grass deep groan; Bill seized arm, lifting I child, cried-- "Come along, lad; let us away!"--and so, staggering stumbling tangled underwood, fled fatal spot. During remainder day, I felt I horrible dream. I scarce knew said me, blamed men idling time. At last hour return aboard came. We marched beach, I felt relief first time feet rested schooner's deck. In course evening I overheard part conversation captain first mate, startled little. They cabin, conversed undertone; skylight off, I overheard every word said. "I do not half like it," said mate, "It seems we will hard fightin' pay." "No pay!" repeated captain, voice suppressed anger, "Do call good cargo nothing pay?" "Very true," returned mate; "but we have got cargo aboard. Why cut cable take French leave them? What is use tryin' kill blackguards it will us manner good?" "Mate," said captain low voice, "you talk like fresh-water sailor. I attribute shyness strange delusion; surely" (his voice assumed slightly sneering tone he said this), "surely I suppose _you_ become soft-hearted! Besides, wrong regard cargo aboard; there is good quarter lying woods, blackguard chief knows will not let take off. He defied us worst yesterday." "Defied us! he?" cried mate bitter laugh. "Poor, contemptible thing!" "And yet he seems contemptible afraid attack him." "Who said I afraid?" growled mate sulkily. "I am ready man ship. But, captain, intend do?" "I intend muffle sweeps row schooner head creek there, point command pile sandal-wood gun. Then I shall land men except two, shall take care schooner ready boat take us off. We creep woods head village, cannibals always dancing round suppers human flesh, carbines men loaded heavy charge buck-shot drop forty fifty first volley. After thing easy enough. The savages take mountains body, shall take require, anchor, away." To plan mate length agreed. As he left cabin I heard captain say-- "Give men extra glass grog, do not forget buck-shot." The reader may conceive horror I heard murderous conversation. I immediately repeated Bill, seemed much perplexed it. At length he said-- "I will tell I will do, Ralph. I will swim ashore dark fix musket tree far place we will land, I will tie long string trigger, fellows cross they will let off, alarm village time prevent attack, time prevent us gettin' back boat. So, Master Captain," added Bill, smile first time seemed mingled good-natured cheerfulness, "you will balked least life Bloody Bill." After grew dark, Bill put resolve practice. He slipped side musket his left hand, his right he swam ashore entered woods. He soon returned, accomplished his purpose, got board without seen, I one deck. When hour midnight approached men mustered deck, cable cut, muffled sweeps got out. These sweeps immensely large oars, requiring couple men work it. In minutes entered mouth creek, indeed mouth small river, took half-an-hour ascend it, although spot intended land six hundred yards mouth, slight current us, mangroves narrowed creek impeded rowers places. Having reached spot, darkened overhanging trees could see difficulty, small kedge anchor attached thin line let softly stern. "Now, lads," whispered captain, he walked along line men, armed teeth, "do not hurry, aim low, do not waste first shots." He pointed boat, men crowded silence. There room row; oars needed, slight push side schooner sent boat gliding shore. "There is need leaving two boat," whispered mate, men stepped out; "we shall want hands. Let Ralph stay." The captain assented, ordered stand readiness boat-hook, shove ashore moment's notice return, shove savages happen approach. He threw his carbine hollow his arm glided bushes, followed his men. With throbbing heart I awaited result plan. I knew exact locality musket placed, Bill described me, I kept straining eyes fixed upon spot. But sound came, I began fear either gone another direction Bill fixed string properly. Suddenly I heard faint click, observed one two bright sparks among bushes. My heart immediately sank within me, I knew trigger indeed pulled, priming caught. The plan, therefore, utterly failed. A feeling dread began creep I stood boat, dark, silent spot, awaiting issue murderous expedition. I shuddered I glanced water glided past like dark reptile. I looked back schooner, her hull barely visible, her tapering masts lost among trees overshadowed her. Her lower sails set, thick gloom quite invisible. Suddenly I heard shot. In moment thousand voices raised yell village; cry rose night air, followed broken shouts scattered parties men bounding woods. Then I heard another shout loud close hand. It voice captain cursing man fired premature shot. Then came order, "Forward!" followed wild hurrah men charged savages. Shots rang quick succession, last loud volley startled echoes woods. It followed multitude wild shrieks, immediately drowned another hurrah men; distance sound proving driving enemies towards sea. While I listening intently sounds, mingled confusion, I startled rustling leaves far me. At first I thought party savages observed schooner, I speedily undeceived observing body natives--apparently several hundreds, far I could guess uncertain light--bounding woods towards scene battle. I saw party outflanked men, would speedily attack rear. And turned out; short time shouts increased tenfold, among I thought I heard death-cry uttered voices familiar ear. At length tumult battle ceased, cries exultation arose savages, I felt assured men conquered. I immediately thrown dreadful consternation. What I do? To taken savages horrible thought of; flee mountains hopeless, I soon discovered; take schooner creek without assistance impossible. I resolved, however, make attempt, hope, point pushing off, hand stayed, blood chilled appalling shriek, I recognised voice one crew. It succeeded shout savages. Then came another another shriek agony, making ears tingle, I felt convinced murdering pirate crew cold blood. With bursting heart brain whirling fire, I seized boat-hook push shore, man sprang bushes. "Stop! Ralph, stop!--there now, push off," he cried, bounded boat violently nearly upset her. It Bill's voice! In another moment board--the boat made fast, line anchor cut, sweeps run out. At first stroke Bill's giant arm schooner nearly pulled ashore, his haste he forgot I could scarcely move unwieldy oar. Springing stern, he lashed rudder position that, aided me, acted him, rendered force strokes nearly equal. The schooner began glide quickly creek; reached mouth, yell thousand voices bank told discovered. Instantly number savages plunged water swam towards us; making much way could overtake us. One, however, immensely powerful man, succeeded laying hold cut rope hung stern, clambered quickly upon deck. Bill caught sight instant his head appeared taffrail; he cease row, appear even notice savage he within yard him. Then, dropping sweep, he struck blow forehead his clenched fist felled deck. Lifting up, he hurled overboard, resumed oar. But greater danger awaited us, savages outrun us bank, plunge water ahead schooner. If succeeded so, fate sealed. For one moment Bill stood irresolute. Then, drawing pistol his belt, he sprang brass gun, held pan his pistol touch-hole, fired. The shot succeeded hiss cannon's priming; blaze crushing thunder monstrous gun burst upon savages deafening roar seemed mountains rent asunder. This enough. The moment surprise hesitation caused unwonted sound gave us time pass point; gentle breeze, dense foliage hitherto prevented us feeling, bulged sails; schooner bent it, shouts disappointed savages grew fainter fainter distance slowly wafted sea. Chapter XXVII Reflections--The wounded man--The squall--True consolation--Death. There power endurance human beings, bodies minds, which, I often thought, seems wonderfully adapted exactly proportioned circumstances individuals may happen placed--a power which, cases, sufficient carry man every obstacle may happen thrown his path life, matter high steep mountain may be, often forsakes moment summit gained, point difficulty passed, leaves prostrated, energies gone, nerves unstrung, feeling incapacity pervading entire frame renders trifling effort almost impossible. During greater part day I subjected severe mental much physical excitement, almost crushed time I relieved duty course evening. But expedition whose failure narrated planned, anxieties energies powerfully aroused I went protracted scenes terrible night without feeling slightest fatigue. My mind body alike active full energy. No sooner last thrilling fear danger past, however, faculties went utterly relaxed; I felt cool breezes Pacific playing around fevered brow, heard free waves rippling schooner's prow, left hated island behind us, senses forsook me, I fell swoon upon deck. From state I quickly aroused Bill, shook arm, saying-- "Hallo, Ralph boy! rouse up, lad; we are safe now. Poor thing! I believe he is fainted." And, raising his arms, he laid folds gaff top-sail, lay upon deck near tiller. "Here, take drop this; it will good, boy," he added, voice tenderness I never heard use before, he held brandy-flask lips. I raised eyes gratefully I swallowed mouthful; next moment head sank heavily upon arm, I fell fast asleep. I slept long, I awoke sun good way horizon, I move first opening eyes, I felt delightful sensation rest pervading me, eyes riveted charmed gorgeous splendour mighty ocean burst upon sight. It dead calm; sea seemed sheet undulating crystal, tipped streaked saffron hues sunrise, yet merged glowing heat noon; deep calm blue dome broken even usual flutter sea-fowl. How long I would lain contemplation peaceful scene I know not, mind recalled suddenly painfully past present sight Bill, seated deck feet, his head reclining, sleep, his right arm, rested tiller. As he seemed rest peacefully, I mean disturb him, slight noise I made raising elbow caused start look round. "Well, Ralph, awake last, boy? You slept long soundly," he said, turning towards me. On beholding his countenance I sprang anxiety. He deadly pale, his hair, hung dishevelled locks his face, clotted blood. Blood also stained his hollow cheeks covered front his shirt, which, greater part his dress, torn soiled mud. "O Bill!" said I deep anxiety, "what matter you? You ill. You must wounded." "Even so, lad," said Bill deep, soft voice, he extended his huge frame couch I risen. "I have got ugly wound, I fear, I have waiting waken, ask get drop brandy mouthful bread cabin lockers. You seemed sleep sweetly, Ralph, I did not like disturb you. But I do not feel much now." I wait till he done talking, ran immediately, returned seconds bottle brandy broken biscuit. He seemed much refreshed eating morsels drinking long draught water mingled little spirits. Immediately afterwards he fell asleep, I watched anxiously he awoke, desirous knowing nature extent his wound. "Ha!" he exclaimed, awaking suddenly slumber hour, "I am better nap, Ralph; I feel twice man I was;" he attempted rise, sank back immediately deep groan. "Nay, Bill, must move, lie still I look wound. I will make comfortable bed deck, get breakfast. After shall tell got it. Cheer up, Bill," seeing he turned his head away; "you will right little, I will capital nurse you, though I am doctor." I left him, lighted fire caboose. While kindling, I went steward's pantry procured materials good breakfast, which, little half-an-hour, I returned companion. He seemed much better, smiled kindly I set cup coffee tray several eggs bread it. "Now then, Bill," said I cheerfully, sitting beside deck, "let us fall to. I am hungry myself, I tell you; but--I forgot--your wound," I added, rising; "let look it." I found wound caused pistol-shot chest. It bleed much, right side, I hopes might serious. But Bill shook his head. "However," said he, "sit down, Ralph, I will tell it. "You see, left boat an' began push bushes, went straight line musket, I expected; unlucky chance did not explode, I saw line torn away men's legs, heard click lock; I fancy priming got damp did not catch. I great quandary do, I could not concoct mind, hurry, good reason firin' piece. But say necessity's mother invention; I givin' clinchin' teeth bide worst o't take come, sudden thought came head. I stepped rest, seemin' awful anxious savages, tripped foot fallen tree, plunged head foremost bush, coorse, carbine exploded! Then came screechin' camp I never heard life. I rose once, rushing rest, captain called halt. "'You a-purpose, villain!' he said tremendous oath, drawin' pistol his belt, let fly right breast. I fell once, remembered till I startled brought round awful yell I ever heard life--except, maybe, shrieks poor critters crushed death yon big canoe. Jumpin' up, I looked round, trees saw fire gleamin' far off, light showed captain men tied hand foot, post, savages dancin' round like demons. I scarce looked second, I saw one go captain flourishing knife, I could wink he plunged his breast, another yell, like one roused me, rang upon ear. I did not wait more, bounding up, went crashing bushes woods. The black fellows caught sight me, however, time prevent jumpin' boat, know." Bill seemed much exhausted recital, shuddered frequently narrative, I refrained continuing subject time, endeavoured draw his mind things. "But now, Bill," said I, "it behoves us think future, course action shall pursue. Here are, wide Pacific, well-appointed schooner, own--at least one better claim have--and world lies us, Moreover, comes breeze, must make minds way steer." "Ralph, boy," said companion; "it matters way go. I fear time short now. Go will; I am content." "Well then, Bill, I think better steer Coral Island, see become dear old comrades, Jack Peterkin. I believe island name, captain pointed chart, I marked afterwards; so, know pretty well position now, I think I steer it. Then, working vessel, true I cannot hoist sails single-handed, luckily enough sail set already; come blow squall, I could least drop peaks main fore sails, clew partially without help, throw her head close wind, keep her shaking till violence squall past. And continued light breezes, I will rig complication blocks fix top-sail halyards, I shall able hoist sails without help. It Is true I will require half day hoist them, do not need mind that. Then I will make sort erection deck screen sun, Bill; manage sit beside tiller steer two hours every day, let get nap, I will engage let duty rest twenty-four hours. And do not feel able steering, I will lash helm heave-to, I get breakfasts dinners; we will manage famously, soon reach Coral Island." Bill smiled faintly I ran strain. "And do," said he, "if comes blow storm?" This question silenced me, I considered I case. At length I laid hand his arm, said, "Bill, man done he do, he ought leave rest God." "O Ralph," said companion faint voice, looking anxiously face, "I wish I feelin's God seem have, hour. I am dyin', Ralph; yet I, braved death hundred times, afraid die. I am afraid enter next world. Something within tells reckoning I go there. But it is me, Ralph. I feel there is chance bein' saved." "Do not say that, Bill," said I deep compassion; "do not say that. I am quite sure there is hope even you, I cannot remember words Bible make think so. Is Bible board, Bill?" "No; last ship belonged poor boy taken aboard his will. He died, poor lad--I think ill-treatment fear. After he gone captain found his Bible flung overboard." I reflected, great sadness self-reproach, way I neglected Bible; flashed across I actually sight God greater sinner blood-stained pirate; for, thought I, he tells he never read Bible, never brought care it; whereas I carefully taught read mother, read daily long I possessed one, yet little purpose I could call mind single text would meet poor man's case, afford consolation he much required. I much distressed, taxed memory long time. At last text flash mind, I wondered much I thought before. "Bill," said I low voice, "'Believe Lord Jesus Christ, thou shalt saved.'" "Ay, Ralph, I have heard missionaries say now, good me? It is me, that; it is likes me." I knew say, although I felt sure word well me, I could remember word whereby I could prove it. After short pause, Bill raised his eyes mine said, "Ralph, I have led terrible life. I have sailor since I boy, I have gone bad worse ever since I left father's roof. I have pirate three years now. It true I choose trade, I inveigled aboard schooner kept force till I became reckless last joined them. Since time hand steeped human blood again. Your young heart would grow cold I--But I go on? It Is use, Ralph; doom fixed." "Bill," said I, "'Though sins red like crimson, shall white snow.' Only believe." "Only believe!" cried Bill, starting his elbow. "I have heard men talk believing easy. Ha! it is easy enough man point rope my, 'I believe would bear weight;' it is another thing man catch hold rope swing edge precipice!" The energy he said this, action accompanied, much Bill. He sank back deep groan. As elements sympathised man's sufferings, low moan came sweeping sea. "Hist, Ralph!" said Bill, opening his eyes; "there is squall coming, lad. Look alive, boy! Clew fore-sail. Drop main-sail peak. Them squalls come quick sometimes." I already started feet, saw heavy squall indeed bearing us. It hitherto escaped notice, owing much engrossed conversation. I instantly Bill desired, schooner lying motionless glassy sea. I observed satisfaction squall bearing larboard bow, would strike vessel position she would best able stand shock. Having done best shorten sail, I returned aft, took stand helm. "Now, boy," said Bill faint voice, "keep her close wind." A seconds afterwards he said, "Ralph, let hear two texts again." I repeated them. "Are ye sure, lad, ye saw Bible?" "Quite sure," I replied. Almost words left lips wind burst upon us, spray dashed decks. For time schooner stood bravely, sprang forward rising sea like war-horse. Meanwhile clouds darkened sky, sea began rise huge billows. There still much sail schooner, gale increased, I feared masts would torn her carried away, wind whistled shrieked strained rigging. Suddenly wind shifted point, heavy sea struck us bow, schooner almost laid her beam ends, I could scarcely keep legs. At moment Bill lost his hold belaying-pin served steady him, he slid stunning violence skylight. As he lay deck close beside me, I could see shock rendered insensible; I dare quit tiller instant, required faculties, bodily mental, manage schooner. For hour blast drove us along, while, owing sharpness vessel's bow press canvas, she dashed waves instead breasting them, thereby drenching decks water fore aft. At end time squall passed away, left us rocking bosom agitated sea. My first care, instant I could quit helm, raise Bill deck place couch. I ran brandy bottle, rubbed his face hands it, endeavoured pour little his throat. But efforts, although I continued long assiduously, avail; I let go hand I chafing, fell heavily deck. I laid hand his heart, sat time quite motionless; flutter there--the pirate dead! Chapter XXVIII Alone deep--Necessity mother invention--A valuable book discovered--Natural phenomenon--A bright day history. It feelings awe, unmingled fear, I seated cabin skylight gazed upon rigid features late comrade, mind wandered his past history contemplated anxiety present position. Alone, midst wide Pacific, imperfect knowledge navigation, schooner requiring least eight men her proper crew! But I tax reader's patience minute detail feelings doings first days followed death companion. I merely mention I tied cannon-ball his feet, and, feelings deepest sorrow, consigned deep. For fully week steady breeze blew east, course lay west north, I made rapid progress towards destination. I could take observation, I much regretted, captain's quadrant cabin; day setting sail island savages I kept dead reckoning, I knew pretty well much leeway schooner made, I hoped hit Coral Island without much difficulty. In I confident I knew position chart (which I understood good one), correct bearings compass. As weather seemed quite settled fine, I got trade-winds, I set preparations hoisting top-sails. This arduous task, first attempts complete failures, owing, great degree, reprehensible ignorance mechanical forces. The first error I made applying apparatus blocks pulleys rope weak, first heave I made broke two, sent staggering after-hatch, I tripped, and, striking main-boom, tumbled companion-ladder cabin. I much bruised somewhat stunned untoward accident. However, I considered fortunate I killed. In next attempt I made sure coming similar accident, I unreeved tackling fitted larger blocks ropes. But although principle I acted quite correct, machinery massive heavy mere friction stiffness thick cordage prevented moving all. Afterwards, however, I came proportion things correctly; I could act avoid reflecting time much better would I learned observation study, instead waiting till I forced acquire painful tedious lessons experience. After tackling prepared good working order, took greater part day hoist main top-sail. As I could steer work time, I lashed helm position that, little watching then, kept schooner her proper course. By means I enabled also go deck things I wanted, occasion required; also cook eat victuals. But I dare trust plan three hours rest I allowed night, wind might shifted, case I blown far course ere I awoke. I was, therefore, habit _heaving-to_ three hours--that is, fixing rudder sails position that, acting other, would keep ship stationary. After night's rest, therefore, I make allowance leeway she made, resume course. Of course I extent anxious lest another squall come, I made best provision I could circumstances, concluded letting go weather-braces top-sails top-sail halyards time, I thereby render sails almost powerless. Besides this, I proposed keep sharp look-out barometer cabin, I observed time sudden fall it, I resolved I would instantly set multiform appliances reducing sail, avoid taken unawares. Thus I sailed prosperously two weeks, fair wind, I calculated I must drawing near Coral Island; thought heart bounded joyful expectation. The book I found board, careful search, volume Captain Cook's voyages. This, I suppose, pirate captain brought order guide him, furnish information regarding islands seas. I found delightful book indeed, I obtained much interesting knowledge sea I sailing, I many opinions, derived experience, corroborated, corrected. Besides reading charming book, daily routine occupations, nothing particular note happened voyage, except once, rising one night, three hours' nap, yet dark, I amazed little alarmed find floating appeared sea blue fire. I often noticed beautiful appearance phosphorescent light, far exceeded anything sort I ever saw before. The whole sea appeared somewhat like milk, remarkably luminous. I rose haste, letting bucket sea, brought water board took cabin examine it; sooner I approach light strange appearance disappeared, I removed cabin lamp luminous light appeared again. I much puzzled this, took little water hollow hand let run off, I found luminous substance left behind palm. I ran lamp, I got gone. I found, however, I went dark hand shone again; I took large glass ship's telescope examined hand minutely, I found one two small patches clear, transparent substance like jelly, thin almost invisible naked eye. Thus I came know beautiful phosphoric light, I often admired before, caused animals, I doubt kind medusae jelly-fish seen parts world. On evening fourteenth day I awakened nap I fallen loud cry, starting I gazed around me. I surprised delighted see large albatross soaring majestically ship. I immediately took head albatross I seen Penguin Island. I had, course, good reason supposing this, idea occurred me, I know why, I cherished it, regarded bird much affection he old friend. He kept company day, left night fell. Next morning, I stood motionless heavy eyes helm--for I slept well--I began weary anxiously daylight, peered towards horizon, I thought I observed something like black cloud dark sky. Being always alert squalls, I ran bow. There could doubt squall, I listened I thought I heard murmur coming gale. Instantly I began work might main cumbrous tackle shortening sail, course hour half reduced--the top-sail yards caps, top-sails clewed up, sheets hauled in, main fore peaks lowered, flying-jib down. While thus engaged dawn advanced, I cast occasional furtive glance ahead midst labour. But things prepared worst, I ran forward looked anxiously bow. I heard roar waves distinctly, single ray rising sun gleamed ocean I saw--what! could I dreaming?--that magnificent breaker ceaseless roar!--that mountain top!--yes, I beheld Coral Island! Chapter XXIX The effect cannon-shot--A happy reunion somewhat moist nature--Retrospect explanations--An awful dive--New plans--The last Coral Island. I almost fell upon deck tumult mingled emotions filled heart I gazed ardently towards beautiful island. It still many miles away, sufficiently near enable trace distinctly well-remembered outlines two mountains. My first impulse utter exclamation gratitude carried former happy home safety; second, jump up, clap hands, shout, run deck, object view giving vent excited feelings. Then I went telescope, spent nearly ten minutes utmost impatience vainly trying get focus, rubbing skin nearly eyes, I discovered taken large glass examine phosphoric water I omitted put again. After I looked impatiently sails, I regretted lowered hastily, moment thought hoisting main top-sail again; recollecting would take full half day accomplish, that, present rate sailing, two hours would bring island, I immediately dismissed idea. The remainder time I spent making feverish preparations arriving seeing dear comrades. I remembered habit rising six, three, I hoped arrive awake. Moreover, I set making ready let go anchor, resolving mind that, I knew depth water passage reef within lagoon, I would run schooner bring opposite bower. Fortunately anchor hanging cat-head, otherwise I never able use it. Now, I cut tackling, would drop weight. After searching among flags, I found terrible black one, I ran peak. While I thought struck me. I went powder-magazine, brought blank cartridge loaded big brass gun, which, remembered, unhoused set sail, I means housing it, stood, bristling alike fair weather foul voyage. I took care grease mouth well, leaving fore part ship, thrust poker fire. All ready. A steady five-knot breeze blowing, I quarter mile reef. I soon entrance, schooner glided quickly through, I glanced affectionately huge breaker, one I seen I bade adieu, I feared ever, island. On coming opposite Water Garden, I put helm hard down. The schooner came round rapid, graceful bend, lost way opposite bower. Running forward, I let go anchor, caught red-hot poker, applied brass gun, saluted mountains _bang_ broke slumbering echoes! Effective although was, however, scarcely equal bang which, instantly after, Peterkin bounded bower, scanty costume, his eyeballs starting his head surprise terror. One gaze he gave, one yell, fled bushes like wild cat. The next moment Jack went exactly performance, difference his movements less like Jack-in-the-box, though less vigorous rapid Peterkin. "Hallo!" I shouted, almost mad joy, "what ho! Peterkin! Jack I hallo! it is _me_!" My shout time arrest them. They halted turned round, instant I repeated cry I saw recognised voice, running full speed towards beach. I could longer contain myself. Throwing jacket, I jumped overboard moment Jack bounded sea. In another moment met deep water, clasped round neck, sank, matter course, bottom! We well-nigh choked, instantly struggled surface, Peterkin sputtering like wounded duck, laughing crying turns, choking salt water! It would impossible convey reader, description, adequate conception scene followed landing beach, stood embracing indiscriminately dripping garments, giving utterance incoherent rhapsodies, mingled wild shouts. It easily imagined described, I draw curtain part history, carry reader forward interval three days. During greater part period Peterkin nothing roast pigs, taro, bread-fruit, ply plantains, plums, potatoes, cocoa-nuts, I related Jack terrible wonderful adventures I gone since last met. After I finished account, made go again; I concluded second recital, I go again, commented upon piecemeal. They much affected I told probable fate Avatea, Peterkin could means brook idea poor girl converted _long pig_! As Jack, he clinched his teeth, shook his fist towards sea, saying time he sorry he broken Tararo's head, he hoped one day he able plant his knuckles bridge chiefs nose! After "pumped dry," Peterkin said, I begged informed happened long absence, particularly got Diamond Cave. "Well, must know," began Jack, "after dived cave, day taken away us, waited patiently half-an-hour, expecting return end time. Then began upbraid staying long, knew would anxious; hour passed, became alarmed, I resolved hazards dive out, see become you, although I felt poor Peterkin, because, he truly said, 'If never come back I am shut life.' However, I promised run risk, he let go; which, say truth, I thought courageous him!" "I think was," interrupted Peterkin, looking Jack edge monstrous potato he happened devouring time. "Well," continued Jack, "you may guess consternation answer halloo. At first I imagined pirates must killed you, left bush thrown sea; occurred would served end theirs, I came conclusion must carried away them. As thought struck me, I observed pirate schooner standing away nor'ard, almost hull horizon, I sat rocks watch her she slowly sank sight. And I tell you, Ralph boy, I she would tears time losing I done, I verily believe, life before--" "Pardon me, Jack, interrupting," said Peterkin; "surely must mistaken that: you have often told baby used howl roar morning to--" "Hold tongue, Peterkin," cried Jack. "Well, schooner disappeared, I dived back cave, much Peterkin's relief, told I seen. We sat long talk matter, agreed make regular, systematic search woods, make sure least killed. But thought difficulty getting cave without help. Peterkin became dreadfully nervous he thought this; I must confess I felt alarm, for, course, I could hope alone take quickly two together brought in; he vowed that, moment longer time, he would take breath salt water. However, help it, I endeavoured calm his fears well I could; 'For,' said I, 'you cannot live here, Peterkin;' he replied,' Of course not, Jack, I die here, that is desirable, better propose something.' So I suggested he take good long breath, trust me. "'Might make large bag cocoa-nut cloth, I could shove head, tie tight round neck?' he asked haggard smile. 'It might let get one breath water!' "'No use,' said I, 'it would fill moment suffocate you. I see nothing it, Peterkin, really cannot keep breath long, let knock down, carry state insensibility.' "But Peterkin did not relish idea. He seemed fear I would able measure exact force blow, might, one hand, hit softly render second third blow necessary, would uncomfortable; or, hand, give smash would entirely spoil his figure-head, mayhap knock life altogether! At last I got persuaded try hold his breath, commit me; he agreed, went. But I got half-way through, he began struggle kick like wild bull, burst grasp, hit roof tunnel. I therefore obliged force violently back cave again, he rose panting surface. In short, he lost his presence mind, and--" "Nothing sort," cried Peterkin indignantly, "I lost wind; I presence mind enough kick I did, I bu'st arms!" "Well, well, it," resumed Jack smile; "but upshot was, hold another consultation point, I really believe that, happy thought mine, consulting yet." "I wish had," interrupted Peterkin sigh.--"I am sure, Ralph, I thought coming back again, I would willingly awaited return months rather endured mental agony I went through. But proceed." "The thought this," continued Jack, "that I tie Peterkin's hands feet cords, lash firmly stout pole five feet long, order render quite powerless, keep straight stiff. You seen his face horror, Ralph, I suggested this; he came see his chance, told set fast I could; 'For,' said he, 'this jokin', Jack, _I_ tell you, sooner it is done better.' I soon procured cordage suitable pole, I returned cave, lashed stiff straight Egyptian mummy; and, say truth, he bad representation English mummy would be, things, he white dead man." "'Now,' said Peterkin tremulous voice, 'swim near edge hole dive, let take long breath, I shall not able speak I have taken it, you will watch face, moment see wink--dive! And oh,' he added earnestly, 'pray do not long!' "I promised pay strictest attention his wishes, swam outlet cave. Here I paused. 'Now then', said I, 'pull away wind, lad.' "Peterkin drew breath long I could help thinking frog fable, wanted swell big ox. Then I looked his face earnestly. Slap went lid his right eye; went head, went heels. We shot passage like arrow, rose surface open sea could count twenty. "Peterkin taken awful load wind that, reaching free air, he let yell loud enough heard mile off, change his feelings sudden great, he wait till landed, began, tied he was, shout sing joy I supported him, left arm, shore. However, middle laugh hyena might envied, I let accidentally slip, extinguished moment. "After happy deliverance, immediately began search dead body, Ralph; idea low hearts sank set off, day day, examine valleys mountain sides utmost care. In three weeks completed survey whole island, least satisfaction knowing killed. But occurred us might thrown sea, examined sands lagoon carefully, afterwards went round outer reef. One day, upon reef, Peterkin espied small, dark object lying among rocks, seemed quite different surrounding stones. We hastened towards spot, found small keg. On knocking head discovered gunpowder." "It I sent that, Jack," said I smile. "Fork out!" cried Peterkin energetically, starting his feet extending his open hand Jack. "Down money, sir, else I will shut life debtor's prison moment return England!" "I will give I O YOU meantime," returned Jack, laughing, "so sit quiet.--The fact is, Ralph, discovered keg powder, Peterkin immediately took bet thousand pounds something it, I took bet ten thousand not." "Peterkin right then," said I, explaining thing occurred. "Well, found useful," continued Jack, "although got little damp; furbished old pistol, Peterkin crack shot now. But continue. We find vestige reef, finally gave hope ever seeing again. After island became dreary place us, began long ship heave sight take us off. But you are back again, dear fellow, looks bright cheerful used do, I love much ever. "And now," continued Jack, "I great desire visit islands South Seas. Here first-rate schooner disposal, I do not see hinder us." "Just thing I going propose," cried Peterkin. "I vote starting once." "Well, then," said Jack, "it seems could better shape course island Avatea lives, endeavour persuade Tararo let her marry black fellow she engaged, instead making long pig her. If he spark gratitude him, he will it. Besides, become champions girl before, behoves us, true knights, rest set her free; least, heroes story-books I ever read would count foul disgrace leave work unfinished." "I am sure I do not know care knights story-books would do," said Peterkin; "but I am certain would capital fun, I am man whenever want me." This plan Jack's quite accordance his romantic, impulsive nature; made his mind save black girl, he could rest thing commenced. "But may great danger attempt," he said, end long consultation subject. "Will you, lads, go spite this?" "Go you!" repeated breath. "Can doubt it?" said I. "For moment," added Peterkin. I need scarcely say that, made minds go enterprise, lost time making preparations quit island; schooner well laden stores every kind long cruise, little except add abundant supply quantity cocoa-nuts, bread-fruit, taro, yams, plums, potatoes, chiefly view carrying fragrance dear island along us long could. When ready, paid farewell visit different familiar spots time spent. We ascended mountain top, gazed last time rich green foliage valleys, white sandy beach, placid lagoon, barrier coral reef crested breakers. Then descended Spouting Cliff, looked pale-green monster made fruitless efforts spear days gone by. From hurried Water Garden, took last dive clear waters, last gambol amongst coral groves. I hurried companions, dressed haste, order long examination tank, Peterkin, fulness his heart, tended utmost care, vivid remembrancer me, rather love natural history. It superb condition--the water clear pellucid crystal; red green seaweed brilliant hues; red, purple, yellow, green, striped anemones fully expanded, stretching arms welcome embrace former master; star-fish, zoophytes, sea-pens, innumerable marine insects looking fresh beautiful; crabs, Peterkin said, looking wide awake, impertinent, rampant, pugnacious ever. It was, indeed, lovely interesting I would scarcely allow torn away it. Last all, returned bower collected articles possessed, axe, pencil-case, broken telescope, penknife, hook made brass ring, sail-needle, landed island; also long boots pistol, besides several curious articles costume manufactured time time. These conveyed board little boat, carved names chip ironwood, thus:-- JACK MARTIN, RALPH ROVER, PETERKIN GAY, fixed inside bower. The boat hoisted board anchor weighed; latter operation cost us great labour much time, anchor heavy could move without aid complex machinery blocks pulleys. A steady breeze blowing shore set sail, little sunset. It swept us quickly past reef sea. The shore grew rapidly indistinct shades evening fell, clipper bark bounded lightly waves. Slowly mountain top sank horizon, became mere speck. In another moment sun Coral Island sank together broad bosom Pacific. Chapter XXX The voyage--The island, consultation danger scouted thing unworthy consideration--Rats cats--The native teacher--Awful revelations--Wonderful effects Christianity. Our voyage next two weeks interesting prosperous. The breeze continued generally fair, times enabled us lie course; being, I said before, clipper-built, pirate schooner could lie close wind make little leeway. We difficulty managing sails, Jack heavy powerful, Peterkin active kitten. Still, however, insufficient crew vessel, one proposed us make voyage forced go many hardships necessity, would turned away pity individual making proposal madman. I pondered good deal, last concluded men know much capable till try, never give way despair undertaking, however difficult may seem--always supposing, however, good one, ask Divine blessing it. Although, therefore, could manage sails easily, nevertheless found pulleys much service us things; though Jack laugh heartily uncouth arrangement ropes blocks, had, sailor's eye, lumbering clumsy appearance. But I drag reader details voyage. Suffice say that, agreeable sail three weeks, arrived island Mango, I recognised description pirate Bill given one conversations. As soon came within sight hove ship held council war. "Now, boys," said Jack, seated beside cabin skylight, "before go business, must go pros cons it; although generously consented stick thick thin, would unfair I see thoroughly understand danger attempt." "Oh, bother danger!" cried Peterkin. "I wonder hear you, Jack, talk danger. When fellow begins talk it, he will soon come magnify degree he will fit face comes, suckin' baby." "Nay, Peterkin," replied Jack gravely, "I will not jested it. I grant we have resolved act, made minds do, think danger. But resolved behoves us look straight face, examine it, walk round it; flinch distant view, we are sure run away danger near.--Now, I understand you, Ralph, island inhabited thorough-going, out-and-out cannibals, whose principal law is, 'Might right, weakest goes wall'?" "Yes," said I; "so Bill gave understand. He told me, however, southern side missionaries obtained footing amongst insignificant tribe. A native teacher sent Wesleyans, succeeded persuading chief part embrace Christianity. But instead advantage enterprise, seems reverse; chief Tararo determined heathen, persecutes Christians--who far weak numbers offer resistance--and looks dislike upon white men, he regards propagators new faith." "It Is pity," said Jack, "that Christian tribe small, shall scarcely safe protection, I fear. If Tararo takes his head wish vessel, kill ourselves, he could take us force. You say native missionary talks English?" "So I believe." "Then, I propose this," said Jack. "We run round south side island, cast anchor Christian village. We far away descried savages, shall get unobserved, time arrange plans heathen tribes know presence. But run risk captured ill-disposed tribes, ill used, not-a--" "Roasted alive eaten," cried Peterkin. "Come, it, Jack. According showing, it is well look danger straight face!" "Well, worst it, certainly. Are prepared, then, take chance that?" "I have prepared mind made long ago," cried Peterkin, swaggering deck his hands thrust his breeches pockets. "The fact is, Jack, I do not believe Tararo ungrateful eat us; I am quite sure he will happy grant us whatever ask, sooner go win better." Peterkin wrong, however, his estimate savage gratitude, sequel show. The schooner put wind, making long run southward, put beat south side Mango, arrived sunset, hove-to coral reef. Here awaited arrival canoe, immediately put rounding-to. When arrived, mild-looking native, apparently forty years age, came board, and, taking his straw hat, made us low bow. He clad respectable suit European clothes; first words he uttered, he stepped Jack shook hands him, were-- "Good day, gentlemen. We happy see Mango; heartily welcome." After returning his salutation, Jack exclaimed, "You must native missionary teacher I heard; not?" "I am. I joy servant Lord Jesus station." "You are man I want see, then," replied Jack; "that is lucky. Come cabin, friend, glass wine. I wish particularly speak you. My men there," pointing Peterkin me, "will look people." "Thank you," said teacher, he followed Jack cabin; "I drink wine, strong drink." "Oh! there is lots water, biscuit." "Now, 'pon word, that is cool!" said Peterkin; "his _men_, forsooth! Well, since men, may well come strong black chaps can.--Hallo, there!" he cried half-dozen natives stood upon deck, gazing wonder saw, "here is you;" he handed tray broken biscuit water. Then, thrusting his hands his pockets, he walked deck enormous swagger, whistling vociferously. In half-an-hour Jack teacher came deck, latter, bidding us cheerful good-evening, entered his canoe paddled shore. When he gone, Peterkin stepped Jack, and, touching his cap, said-- "Well, captain, communications make _men?_" "Yes," cried Jack; "ready about, mind helm, clew tongue, I con schooner passage reef. The teacher, seems first-rate fellow, says it is quite deep, good anchorage within lagoon close shore." While vessel slowly advancing her anchorage, light breeze, Jack explained us Avatea still island, living amongst heathens; she expressed strong desire join Christians, Tararo would let her, kept her constantly close confinement. "Moreover," continued Jack, "I find she belongs one Samoan Islands, Christianity introduced long her capture heathens neighbouring island; day she taken she joined Church planted excellent body London Missionary Society. The teacher tells me, too, poor girl fallen love Christian chief, lives island fifty miles south one, she meditating desperate attempt escape. So, see, come nick time. I fancy chief fellow heard of, Ralph, Island Emo. Besides this, heathen savages war among themselves, there is battle fought day to-morrow, principal leader Tararo; we will able commence negotiations rascally chief till day after." The village anchored beautifully situated head small bay, margin trees every description peculiar tropics rose richest luxuriance summit hilly ridge, line demarcation possessions Christians neighbouring heathen chief. The site settlement extensive plot flat land, stretching gentle slope sea mountain. The cottages stood several hundred yards beach, protected glare sea rich foliage rows large Barringtonia trees girt shore. The village mile length, perfectly straight, wide road middle, either side rows tufted-topped ti tree, whose delicate beautiful blossoms, hanging beneath plume-crested tops, added richness scene. The cottages natives built beneath trees, kept excellent order, little garden front, tastefully laid planted, walks covered black white pebbles. Every house doors Venetian windows, painted partly lamp-black made candle-nut, partly red ochre, contrasted powerfully dazzling coral lime covered walls. On prominent position stood handsome church, quite curiosity way. It hundred feet long fifty broad, seated throughout accommodate upwards two thousand persons. It six large folding doors, twelve windows Venetian blinds; although large substantial edifice, built, told teacher, space two months! There single iron nail fabric, natives constructed chiefly stone bone axes tools, one two axes tools European manufacture. Everything around beautiful spot wore aspect peace plenty; dropped anchor within stone's cast substantial coral wharf, I could avoid contrasting wretched village Emo, I witnessed many frightful scenes. When teacher afterwards told people tribe become converts year previous arrival, living practice bloody system idolatry, I could refrain exclaiming, "What convincing proof Christianity God!" On landing little boat, received warm welcome teacher his wife; latter also native, clothed simple European gown straw bonnet. The shore lined hundreds natives, whose persons less clothed native cloth. Some men kind poncho formed cloth, legs uncovered; others wore clumsily fashioned trousers, upper garment except hats made straw cloth. Many dresses, women men, grotesque enough, bad imitations European garb; wore dress sort other. They seemed glad see us, crowded round us teacher led way his dwelling, entertained, sumptuous manner, baked pig varieties fruits vegetables island produced. We much annoyed, however, rats: seemed run house like domestic animals. As sat table, one peeped us edge cloth, close Peterkin's elbow, floored blow snout his knife, exclaiming he so-- "I say, Mister Teacher, do not set traps brutes? Surely fond them!" "No," replied teacher smile; "we would glad get rid could; trap rats island, would occupy whole time." "Are they, then, numerous?" inquired Jack. "They swarm everywhere. The poor heathens north side eat them, think sweet. So people formerly; eat many now, missionary last expressed disgust it. The poor people asked wrong eat rats; he told certainly wrong, people England would much disgusted asked eat rats." We hour house kind-hearted man convinced truth his statement numbers; rats ran floors dozens, meal two men stationed table keep off! "What pity cats!" said Peterkin, he aimed blow another reckless intruder, missed it. "We would indeed glad few," rejoined teacher, "but difficult got. The hogs, find, good rat-killers, seem able keep numbers down. I heard better cats." As teacher said this, his good-natured black face wrinkled smile merriment. Observing I noticed it, he said-- "I smiled I remembered fate first cat taken Rarotonga. This one stations London Missionary Society. It, like own, infested rats, cat brought last island. It large black one. On turned loose, instead content stay among men, cat took mountains, lived wild state, sometimes paying visits night houses natives; whom, living distance settlement, heard cat's arrival, dreadfully frightened consequence, calling 'monster deep,' flying terror away it. One night cat--feeling desire company, I suppose--took way house chief recently converted Christianity, begun learn read pray. The chief's wife, sitting awake his side he slept, beheld horror two fires glistening doorway, heard surprise mysterious voice. Almost petrified fear, she awoke her husband, began upbraid forsaking his old religion burning his god, who, she declared, come avenged them. 'Get pray! get pray!' she cried. The chief arose, opening his eyes beheld glaring lights heard ominous sound. Impelled extreme urgency case, he commenced, possible vehemence, vociferate alphabet, prayer God deliver vengeance Satan! On hearing this, cat, much alarmed themselves, fled precipitately away, leaving chief his wife congratulating efficacy prayer." We much diverted anecdote, teacher related English good certainly could supposed native colour his face foreign accent his tone. Next day walked interesting man, much entertained instructed his conversation, rambled cool, shady groves bananas, citrons, limes, trees, sauntered among cottages natives, watched laboured diligently taro beds manufactured tapa native cloth. To Jack put questions medium missionary; replies surprise us extent knowledge. Indeed, Peterkin truly remarked "they seemed know considerable deal Jack himself!" Among pieces interesting information obtained following, regard coral formations:-- "The islands Pacific," said friend, "are three different kinds classes. Those first class volcanic, mountainous, wild; shooting jagged peaks clouds elevation ten fifteen thousand feet. Those second class crystallised limestone, vary height one hundred five hundred feet. The hills wild broken first class, richly clothed vegetation, beautiful. I doubt Coral Island wrecked one class. They supposed upheaved bottom sea volcanic agency, volcanic nature, neither coral formation. Those third class low coralline islands, usually lagoons water midst; numerous. "As manner coral islands reefs formed, various opinions point. I give seems probable theory--a theory, I may add, held good scientific missionaries. It well known much lime salt water; also known coral composed lime. It supposed polypes, coral insects, power attracting lime bodies; material build little cells habitations. They choose summit volcano, top submarine mountain, foundation build; found never work great depth surface. On work; polypes mountain top, course, reach surface first, outer edges reach top sooner others centre, thus forming coral reef surrounding lagoon water central island; insects within lagoon cease working. When surface water reached, myriads wonderful creatures die. Then birds visit spot, seeds thus conveyed thither, take root, spring up, flourish. Thus commenced coralline islets seen many seas. The reefs round large islands formed similar manner. When consider," added missionary, "the smallness architects used heavenly Father order form lovely innumerable islands, filled much feeling induced ancient king exclaim, 'How manifold, O Lord, Thy works! wisdom hast Thou made all.'" We heartily agreed missionary sentiment, felt little gratified find opinions Jack I led form personal observation Coral Island thus great extent corroborated. The missionary also gave us account manner Christianity introduced among them. He said: "When missionaries first sent here, three years ago, small vessel brought them; chief, dead, promised treat well two native teachers left wives island. But scarcely boat landed returned ship, natives began maltreat guests, taking away possessed, offering violence, that, boat sent haste fetch away, clothes men women torn nearly backs. "Two years vessel visited again, I, her, volunteered land alone, without goods whatever, begging wife might brought following year--that is, _this_ year; and, see, she me. But surf high boat could land me; nothing trousers shirt, catechisms Bible, besides portions Scripture translated Mango tongue, I sprang sea, swam ashore crest breaker. I instantly dragged beach natives; who, finding I nothing worth upon me, let alone. I made signs friends ship leave me; did. At first natives listened silence, laughed I said I preached Gospel blessed Saviour Jesus Christ them. Afterwards treated ill sometimes; I persevered, continued dwell among them, dispute, exhort give sinful ways life, burn idols, come Jesus. "About month I landed, I heard chief dead. He father present chief, consistent member Church. It custom chief dies his wives strangled buried him. Knowing this, I hastened his house endeavour prevent cruelty possible. When I arrived, I found two wives already killed, another act strangled. I pleaded hard her, late; she already dead. I entreated son spare fourth wife, much hesitation prayer granted; half-an-hour afterwards poor woman repented unfaithful, she termed it, her husband, insisted strangled; accordingly done. "All time chief's son walking his father's house brow black thunder. When he entered I went him, found, surprise, his father _not_ dead! The old man sitting mat corner, expression placid resignation his face. "'Why,' said I, 'have strangled father's wives he dead?' "To son replied, 'He dead. That longer father. He good dead now. He _buried alive_.' "I remembered heard custom among Feejee Islanders, reigning chief grows old infirm, heir chieftainship right depose his father; case he considered dead, buried alive. The young chief follow custom, despite earnest entreaties pleadings, old chief buried day eyes grave his four strangled wives! Oh, heart groaned I saw this! I prayed God open hearts poor creatures, He already opened mine, pour light love Gospel Jesus. My prayer answered soon. A week afterwards, son, chief tribe, came me, bearing his god his shoulders, groaning beneath weight. Flinging feet, he desired burn it! "You may conceive overjoyed I this. I sprang embraced him, I she would tears joy. Then made fire, burned god ashes, amid immense concourse people, seemed terrified done, shrank back burned god, expecting signal vengeance taken upon us; seeing nothing happened, changed minds, thought God must true one all. From time mission prospered steadily; now, single man tribe burned his household gods become convert Christianity, few, I hope, true followers Lamb, plucked brands burning Him save unto uttermost. I tell progress time; see," he said, waving his hand around him, "the village church exist year ago!" We indeed much interested account, I could help heart praying God prosper missionary societies send inestimable blessings islands dark bloody idolatry. The teacher also added tribes indignant one burned gods, threatened destroy altogether, done nothing yet. "And should," said teacher, "the Lord side; shall afraid?" "Have missionaries many stations seas?" inquired Jack. "Oh yes. The London Missionary Society great many Tahiti group, islands quarter. Then Wesleyans Feejee Islands themselves, Americans many stations groups. But still, friend, hundreds islands natives never heard Jesus, good word God, Holy Spirit; thousands living dying practice terrible sins bloody murders already heard. I trust, friends," he added, looking earnestly faces--"I trust ever return England, tell Christian friends horrors hear regard islands _literally true,_ heard worst, _'half told them;'_ perpetrated foul deeds darkness man may speak. You may also tell them," he said, looking around smile, tear gratitude trembled his eye rolled his coal-black cheek--"tell blessings Gospel wrought _here_!" We assured friend would certainly forget his request. On returning towards village, noon, remarked beautiful whiteness cottages. "That owing lime plastered," said teacher. "When natives converted, I described, I set work build cottages themselves, also handsome church see. When framework parts house up, I sent people fetch coral sea. They brought immense quantities. Then I made cut wood, piling coral it, set fire. "'Look! look!' cried poor people amazement, 'what wonderful people Christians are! He roasting stones. We shall need taro bread-fruit more; may eat stones!' "But surprise still greater coral reduced fine, soft white powder. They immediately set great shout, mingling lime water, rubbed faces bodies it, ran village screaming delight. They also much surprised another thing saw do. I wished make household furniture, constructed turning-lathe assist me. The first thing I turned leg sofa; sooner finished chief seized wonder delight, ran village exhibiting people, looked upon great admiration. The chief then, tying string it, hung round his neck ornament! He afterwards told he seen he became Christian, he would made his god!" As teacher concluded anecdote reached his door. Saying he business attend to, he left us amuse best could. "Now, lads," said Jack, turning abruptly towards us, buttoning his jacket he spoke, "I am see battle. I have particular fondness seein' bloodshed, I must find nature fellows see customs eyes, I may able speak again, need be, authoritatively. It is six miles off, do not run much risk getting rap stray stone overshot arrow. Will go?" "To sure will," said Peterkin. "If chance see us we will cut run it," added Jack. "Dear me!" cried Peterkin--"_you_ run! I thought would scorn run one." "So I would, duty fight," returned Jack coolly; "but I do not want fight, do not intend fight, offer attack us I will run away like veriest coward ever went name Peterkin. So come along." Chapter XXXI A strange bloody battle--The lion bearded his den--Frightful scenes cruelty, fear future. We ascertained teacher direction spot battle fought, walk two hours, reached it. The summit bare hill place chosen; for, unlike islanders addicted bush fighting, Mango habit meeting open ground. We arrived two parties commenced deadly struggle, and, creeping close dared among rocks, lay watched them. The combatants drawn face face, side ranged rank four deep. Those first row armed long spears; second clubs defend spearmen; third row composed young men slings; fourth consisted women, carried baskets stones slingers, clubs spears supply warriors. Soon arrived attack made great fury. There science displayed. The two bodies savages rushed headlong upon engaged general _mêlée_, dreadful set men I never seen. They wore grotesque war-caps made various substances decorated feathers. Their faces bodies painted make look frightful possible; brandished massive clubs, leaped, shouted, jelled, dashed ground, I thought I never seen men look like demons before. We much surprised conduct women, seemed perfect furies, hung heels husbands order defend them. One stout young woman saw whose husband hard pressed overcome she lifted large stone, throwing his opponent's head, felled earth. But battle last long. The band distant us gave way routed, leaving eighteen comrades dead upon field. These victors brained lay; and, putting brains leaves, went them, afterwards informed, temples present gods earnest human victims soon brought there. We hastened back Christian village feelings deepest sadness sanguinary conflict witnessed. Next day, breakfasting friend teacher, made preparations carrying plan. At first teacher endeavoured dissuade us. "You know," said he, turning Jack, "the danger run venturing amongst ferocious savages. I feel much pity poor Avatea; likely succeed saving her, may die attempt." "Well," said Jack quietly, "I afraid die good because." The teacher smiled approvingly he said this, and, little conversation, agreed accompany us interpreter; saying that, although Tararo unfriendly him, he hitherto treated respect. We went board schooner, resolved sail round island drop anchor opposite heathen village. We manned her natives, hoped overawe savages displaying brass gun advantage. The teacher soon came board, and, setting sails, put sea. In two hours made cliffs reverberate crash big gun, fired way salute, ran British ensign peak cast anchor. The commotion shore showed us struck terror hearts natives; but, seeing offer molest them, canoe length put paddled cautiously towards us. The teacher showed himself, and, explaining friends wished palaver chief, desired native go tell come board. We waited long much impatience answer. During time native teacher conversed us again, told us many things concerning success Gospel among islands; and, perceiving means much gratified ought hearing good news, he pressed us closely regard personal interest religion, exhorted us consider souls certainly great danger wretched heathen pitied much, already found salvation Jesus Christ. "Nay, further," he added, "if unhappy case, are, sight God, much worse savages (forgive me, young friends, saying so): knowledge, light, profess believe; you, contrary, brought light blessed Gospel, call Christians. These poor savages indeed enemies Lord; you, ye true believers, traitors!" I must confess heart condemned teacher spoke earnest manner, I knew reply. Peterkin, too, seem like it, I thought would willingly escaped. But Jack seemed deeply impressed, wore anxious expression his naturally grave countenance; he assented teacher's remarks, put many earnest questions. Meanwhile, natives composed crew, nothing particular do, squatted deck taken little books containing translated portions New Testament, along hymns spelling-books, busily engaged, vociferating alphabet, others learning prayers heart, sang hymns--all utterly unmindful presence. The teacher soon joined them, soon afterwards engaged prayer, afterwards translated us, proved petition success undertaking, conversion heathen. While thus engaged, canoe put shore several savages leaped deck, one advanced teacher informed Tararo could come board day, busy religious ceremonies gods, could account postponed. He also engaged friendly chief take his departure island, therefore begged teacher his friends would land pay visit him. To teacher returned answer would land immediately. "Now, lads," said Jack, step little boat, "I am going take weapons me, I recommend take none either. We altogether power savages, utmost could do, attack us, would kill overpowered. I think chance success lies mild measures; do not think so?" To I assented gladly, Peterkin replied laying huge bell-mouthed blunderbuss, divesting pair enormous horse-pistols he purposed overawe natives! We jumped boat rowed ashore. On reaching beach received crowd naked savages, shouted rude welcome, conducted us house she would baked pig variety vegetables prepared us. Having partaken these, teacher begged conducted chief; seemed hesitation, consultation among one men stood forward spoke teacher. "What says he?" inquired Jack savage concluded. "He says chief going temple his god cannot see us yet; must patient, friend." "Well," cried Jack, rising, "if he will not come see me, I will e'en go see him. Besides, I great desire witness proceedings temple theirs. Will go me, friend?" "I cannot," said teacher, shaking his head; "I must go heathen temples witness inhuman rites, except purpose condemning wickedness folly." "Very good," returned Jack; "then I will go alone, I cannot condemn doings till I seen them." Jack arose, we, determined go also, followed banana groves rising ground immediately behind village, top stood Buré, temple, dark shade group iron-wood trees. As went village, I led contrast rude huts sheds almost naked, savage-looking inhabitants natives Christian village, who, use teacher's scriptural expression, "clothed right mind." As turned broad path leading towards hill, arrested shouts approaching multitude rear. Drawing aside bushes, awaited coming up, drew near observed procession natives, many dancing gesticulating frantic manner. They exceedingly hideous aspect, owing black, red, yellow paints faces naked bodies bedaubed. In midst came band men carrying three four planks, seated rows upwards dozen men. I shuddered involuntarily I recollected sacrifice human victims island Emo, turned look fear Jack I said-- "O Jack! I terrible dread going commit cruel practices wretched men. We better go temple. We shall horrified without able good, I fear going kill them." Jack's face wore expression deep compassion he said low voice, "No fear, Ralph; sufferings poor fellows long ago." I turned start he spoke, glancing men, quite near spot stood, saw dead. They tied firmly ropes sitting posture planks, seemed, bent sightless eyeballs grinning mouths dancing crew below, laughing ghastly mockery utter inability enemies hurt now. These, discovered afterwards, men slain battle previous day, way first presented gods eaten, Behind came two men leading third, whose hands pinioned behind his back. He walked firm step, wore look utter indifference his face led along; concluded he must criminal receive slight punishment his faults. The rear procession brought shouting crowd women children, mingled followed temple. Here arrived minutes. The temple tall circular building, open one side. Around strewn heaps human bones skulls. At table inside sat priest, elderly man long grey beard. He seated stool, lay several knives, made wood, bone, splinters bamboo, he performed his office dissecting dead bodies. Farther lay variety articles dedicated god, among many spears clubs. I observed among latter human teeth sticking them, victims clubbed mouths. Before temple bodies, painted vermilion soot, arranged sitting posture; man called "dan-vosa" (orator), advanced, laying his hands heads, began chide them, apparently low, bantering tone. What he said knew not, he went he waxed warm, last shouted top his lungs, finally finished kicking bodies running away, amid shouts laughter people, rushed forward. Seizing bodies leg arm, hair head, dragged stumps stones sloughs exhausted. The bodies brought back temple dissected priest, taken baked. Close temple large fire kindled, stones heated red hot. When ready spread ground, thick coating leaves strewn slack heat. On "lovo," oven, bodies placed, covered over, left bake. The crowd ran terrible yells towards neighbouring hill mound, observed framework house lying ready erected. Sick horror, yet fascinated curiosity, staggered mechanically, scarce knowing going did, feeling sort impression saw dreadful dream. Arrived place, saw multitude crowding round certain spot. We pressed forward obtained sight doing. A large wooden beam post lay ground, beside parts frame-work house, close end hole seven feet deep upwards two feet wide. While looked, man observed his hands pinioned carried circle. His hands free, his legs tightly strapped together. The post house placed hole, man put beside it. His head good way surface hole, his arms clasped round post. Earth thrown covered stamped down; this, afterwards told, ceremony usually performed dedication new temple erection chiefs house! "Come, come," cried Jack, beholding horrible tragedy; "we seen enough, enough--far enough! Let us go." Jack's face looked ghastly pale haggard hurried back rejoin teacher, I doubt he felt terrible anxiety he considered number ferocity savages, weakness arms ready indeed essay, impotent effect, Avatea's deliverance ruthless men. Chapter XXXII An unexpected discovery, bold, reckless defiance, consequences--Plans escape, heroic resolve. When returned shore related friend passed, he greatly distressed, groaned spirit; sat long conversation, interrupted arrival Tararo beach, accompanied number followers bearing baskets vegetables fruits heads. We advanced meet him, he expressed, interpreter, much pleasure seeing us. "And friends wish say me?" he inquired. The teacher explained came beg Avatea might spared. "Tell him," said Jack, "that I consider I right ask him, saved girl's life, lives his people also; say I wish her allowed follow her wishes, join Christians." While translated, chiefs brow lowered, could see plainly request met favourable reception. He replied considerable energy, length. "What says he?" inquired Jack. "I regret say he listen proposal. He says he pledged his word his friend girl shall sent him, deputy even island awaiting fulfilment pledge." Jack bit his lip suppressed anger. "Tell Tararo," he exclaimed flashing eye, "that he grant demand worse him. Say I big gun board schooner blow his village sea, he give girl." "Nay, friend," said teacher gently, "I tell that; must 'overcome evil good.'" "What friend say?" inquired chief, seemed nettled Jack's looks defiance. "He displeased," replied teacher. Tararo turned away smile contempt, walked towards men carried baskets vegetables, emptied whole beach enormous pile. "What there?" I inquired. "I think laying gift intend present one," said teacher. At moment couple men appeared, leading young girl them, and, going towards heap fruits vegetables, placed her top it. We started surprise fear, young female us recognised Samoan girl Avatea. We stood rooted earth surprise thick-coming fears. "Oh dear young friend," whispered teacher voice deep emotion, he seized Jack arm, "she made sacrifice even now!" "Is she?" cried Jack vehement shout, spurning teacher aside, dashing two natives stood his way, he rushed towards heap, sprang side, seized Avatea arm. In another moment he dragged her down, placed her back large tree, and, wrenching war-club hand native seemed powerless petrified surprise, whirled his head, yelled, rather shouted, his face blazed fury, "Come on, whole nation you, ye like it, worst!" It seemed though challenge literally accepted; every savage ground ran precipitately Jack club spear, doubtless would speedily poured his brave blood sod, teacher rushed them, and, raising his voice utmost, cried-- "Stay hands, warriors! It part judge matter. It Tararo, chief, say whether young man shall live, die." The natives arrested; I know whether gratifying acknowledgment his superiority thus made teacher, lingering feeling gratitude Jack's former aid time need, influenced Tararo, he stepped forward, and, waving his hand, said his people, "Desist. The young man's life mine." Then, turning Jack, he said, "You forfeited liberty life me. Submit yourself, numerous sand upon shore. You one; die?" "Villain!" exclaimed Jack passionately, "I may die, assuredly I shall perish alone. I submit promise girl shall injured." "You bold," replied chief haughtily, "but foolish. Yet I say Avatea shall sent away--at least, three days." "You better accept terms," whispered teacher entreatingly. "If persist mad defiance, slain, Avatea lost. Three days worth having." Jack hesitated moment, lowered his club, throwing moodily ground, crossed his arms his breast hung his head silence. Tararo seemed pleased his submission, told teacher say he forget his former services, therefore would leave free his person, schooner would detained till he considered matter. While teacher translated this, he approached near Avatea standing possible, without creating suspicion, whispered her words native language. Avatea, whole foregoing scene stood leaning tree perfectly passive, seemingly quite uninterested going on, replied single rapid glance her dark eye, instantly cast ground her feet. Tararo advanced, taking girl hand, led her unresistingly away; Jack, Peterkin, I returned teacher board schooner. On reaching deck, went cabin, Jack threw himself, state great dejection, couch; teacher seated his side, laying his hand upon his shoulder, said-- "Do give way anger, young friend. God given us three days, must use means In power free poor girl slavery. We must sit idle disappointment, must act--" "Act!" cried Jack, raising tossing back his hair wildly; "it mockery talk acting one bound hand foot. How I act? I cannot fight whole nation savages single-handed. Yes," he said bitter smile, "I _can_ fight them, I cannot conquer them, save Avatea." "Patience, friend; spirit good one now. You cannot expect blessing alone ensure success unless submissive. I tell plans listen." "Listen!" cried Jack eagerly: "of course I will, good fellow; I know plans. Out them. I hope show I get girl board schooner, I would anchor away time. But proceed plans." The teacher smiled sadly. "Ah, friend! one fathom anchor chain rattle drew in, thousand warriors would standing deck. No, no, could done. Even ship would taken Tararo feeling gratitude towards you. But I know Tararo well. He man falsehood, unconverted savages are. The chief he promised girl powerful, Tararo _must_ fulfil his promise. He told he would nothing girl three days, party take her away ready start three days. Still, he might made prisoner three days, I say God given us." "Well, propose do?" said Jack impatiently. "My plan involves much danger, I see other, I think courage brave it. It this. There island fifty miles south this, natives Christians, two years more, principal chief Avatea's lover. Once there, Avatea would safe. Now, I suggest abandon schooner. Do think make great sacrifice?" "Friend," replied Jack, "when I make mind go thing importance, I make sacrifice." The teacher smiled. "Well, then, savages could conceive possible sake girl would voluntarily lose fine vessel; therefore long she lies think safe: I suggest get quantity stores conveyed sequestered part shore, provide small canoe, put Avatea board, three would paddle Christian island." "Bravo!" cried Peterkin, springing seizing teacher's hand. "Missionary, you are regular brick. I did not think much you." "As me," continued teacher, "I remain board till discover gone. Then ask gone to, I refuse tell." "And what will result that?" inquired Jack. "I know not. Perhaps kill me; but," he added, looking Jack peculiar smile, "I, too, afraid die good because!" "But get hold Avatea?" inquired Jack. "I arranged her meet us particular spot, I guide to-night. We shall arrange it. She easily manage elude her keepers, strict watching her, thinking impossible she could escape island. Indeed, I sure idea never enter heads. But, I said, run great danger. Fifty miles small canoe, open sea, great voyage make. You may miss island, too, case direction hundred miles more; lose way fall among heathens, know law Feejee--a castaway gains shore doomed die. You must count cost, young friend." "I counted it," replied Jack. "If Avatea consents run risk, certainly I will; comrades also. Besides," added Jack, looking seriously teacher's face, "your Bible--_our_ Bible--tells ONE delivers call Him time trouble; holds winds His fists, waters hollow His hand." We set active preparations intended voyage; collected together things require, laid deck provisions sufficient maintain us several weeks, purposing load canoe much she could hold consistently speed safety. These covered tarpaulin, intending convey canoe hours starting. When night spread her sable curtain scene, prepared land; first kneeling along natives teacher, latter implored blessing enterprise. Then rowed quietly shore followed sable guide, led us long detour, order avoid village, place rendezvous. We stood five minutes gloomy shade thick foliage dark figure glided noiselessly us. "Ah! are," said Jack, Avatea approached.--"Now, then, tell her we have come about, do not waste time." "I understan' leetl English," said Avatea low voice. "Why, pick English?" exclaimed Jack amazement; "you dumb stone I saw last." "She learned she knows me," said teacher, "since she came island." We gave Avatea full explanation plans, entering details, concealing none danger, she might fully aware risk she ran. As anticipated, she glad opportunity thus afforded her escape her persecutors think danger risk. "Then you are willing go us, you?" said Jack. "Yis, I willing go." "And you are afraid trust deep sea far?" "No, I 'fraid go. Safe Christian." After consultation, teacher suggested time return, bade Avatea good-night, appointed meet cliff canoe lay following night, dark, hastened away--we row board schooner muffled oars, Avatea glide back her prison-hut among Mango savages. Chapter XXXIII The flight--The pursuit--Despair results--The lion bearded his den again--Awful danger threatened wonderfully averted--A terrific storm. As time meditated flight drew near, became naturally fearful lest purpose discovered, spent whole following day state nervous anxiety. We resolved go ashore ramble village, observe habits dwellings people, thought air affected indifference events previous day would likely course conduct avert suspicion intentions. While thus occupied, teacher remained board Christian natives, whose powerful voices reached us ever anon engaged singing hymns prayer. At last long tedious day came close, sun sank sea, short-lived twilight regions, I already referred, ended abruptly dark night. Hastily throwing blankets little boat, stepped it, whispering farewell natives schooner, rowed gently lagoon, taking care keep near beach possible. We rowed utmost silence, muffled oars, one observed us distance yards, he might almost taken us phantom-boat, shadow dark water. Not breath air stirring; but, fortunately, gentle ripple sea upon shore, mingled soft roar breaker distant reef, effectually drowned slight plash unavoidably made water dipping oars. A quarter hour sufficed bring us overhanging cliff whose black shadow little canoe lay, her bow water ready launched, her cargo already stowed away. As keel little boat grated sand, hand laid upon bow, dim form seen. "Ha!" said Peter kin whisper, he stepped upon beach, "is you, Avatea?" "Yis, me," reply. "All right! Now, then, gently. Help shove canoe," whispered Jack teacher; "and, Peterkin, shove blankets aboard--we may want long. Avatea, step middle--that is right." "Is ready?" whispered teacher. "Not quite," replied Peterkin.--"Here, Ralph, lay hold pair oars, stow away can. I do not like paddles. After we are safe away I will try rig rollicks them." "Now, then, shove off." One earnest squeeze kind teacher's hand, his whispered blessing yet sounding ears, shot like arrow shore, sped still waters lagoon, paddled swiftly strong arms willing hearts could urge us long swell open sea. All night whole following day plied paddles almost total silence without halt, save twice recruit failing energies mouthful food draught water. Jack taken bearing island starting, and, laying small pocket-compass him, kept head canoe due south, chance hitting island depended much faithfulness steersman keeping tiny bark exactly constantly proper course. Peterkin I paddled bow, Avatea worked untiringly middle. As sun's lower limb dipped gilded edge sea, Jack ceased working, threw his paddle, called halt. "There!" he cried, heaving deep, long-drawn sigh, "we have put considerable breadth water us black rascals, we will hearty supper sound sleep." "Heat, hear!" cried Peterkin. "Nobly spoken, Jack.--Hand drop water, Ralph.--Why, girl, what is wrong you? You look like black owl blinking sunshine." Avatea smiled. "I sleepy," she said; prove truth this, she laid her head edge canoe fell fast asleep. "That is uncommon sharp practice," said Peterkin broad grin. "Do not think awake her make her eat something first? Or perhaps," he added, grave, meditative look--"perhaps might put food her mouth, elegantly open present moment, see she would swallow asleep. If so, Ralph, might come round front feed her quietly, Jack I tucking victuals. It would monstrous economy time." I could help smiling Peterkin's idea, indeed, I pondered it, seemed remarkably good theory; nevertheless I declined put practice, fearful result victual chance go wrong throat. But suggesting Peterkin, he exclaimed-- "Down wrong throat, man! why, fellow half eye might see went Avatea's throat could go wrong throat!--unless, indeed, sudden become inordinately selfish, think throats world wrong ones except own. However, do not talk much, hand pork Jack finishes it. I feel entitled least one minute morsel." "Peterkin, you are villain--a paltry little villain," said Jack quietly, he tossed hind-legs (including tail) cold roast pig his comrade; "and I must express regret unavoidable circumstances thrust society upon me, necessity compelled cultivate acquaintance. Were incapable walking upon water, I would order you, sir, canoe." "There! you have awakened Avatea long tongue," retorted Peterkin frown, girl gave vent deep sigh. "No," he continued, "it snore. Perchance she dreameth her black Apollo.--I say, Ralph, leave one little slice yam. Between Jack I run chance put short allowance, not--yei--a--a--ow!" Peterkin's concluding remark yawn great energy Jack recommended postpone conclusion his meal till next morning--a piece advice he followed quickly I forcibly reminded his remark, minutes before, regard sharp practice Avatea. My readers observed, probably, time I much given meditation; not, therefore, surprised learn I fell deep reverie subject sleep, continued without intermission night, prolonged without interruption following morning. But I cannot feel assured I actually slept time, although I tolerably certain I awake. Thus lay like shadow still bosom ocean, night closed in, around calm, dark, silent. A thrilling cry alarm Peterkin startled us morning, grey dawn began glimmer east. "What is wrong?" cried Jack, starting up. Peterkin replied pointing look anxious dread towards horizon; glance sufficed show us one largest-sized war-canoes approaching us! With groan mingled despair anger Jack seized his paddle, glanced compass, suppressed voice commanded us "give way." But require urged. Already four paddles glancing water, canoe bounded glassy sea like dolphin, shout pursuers told observed motions. "I see something like land ahead," said Jack hopeful tone. "It seems impossible could made island yet; still, so, may reach fellows catch us, canoe light muscles fresh." No one replied; for, say truth, felt long chase chance whatever canoe held nearly hundred warriors. Nevertheless, resolved utmost escape, paddled degree vigour kept us well advance pursuers. The war-canoe far behind us seemed little speck sea, shouts, crew occasionally gave vent, came faintly towards us morning breeze. We therefore hoped able keep advance hour two, might perhaps reach land ahead. But hope suddenly crushed supposed land long rising sky, thus proving fog-bank! A bitter feeling disappointment filled heart, expressed countenance, beheld termination hopes. But little time think regret. Our danger great imminent permit moment's relaxation exertions. No hope animated bosoms; feeling despair, strange say, lent us power work, nerved arms energy several hours ere savages overtook us. When saw indeed chance escape, paddling longer would serve exhaust strength, without good, turned side canoe towards approaching enemy, laid paddles. Silently, look bitter determination his face, Jack lifted one light boat-oars brought us, resting his shoulder, stood attitude bold defiance. Peterkin took oar also stood up, anger visible his countenance. When sparkling fun, usually wore mild, sad expression, deepened present occasion, he glanced Avatea, sat her face resting her hands upon her knees. Without knowing well I intended do, I also arose grasped paddle hands. On came large canoe like war-horse deep, foam curling sharp bow, spearheads savages glancing beams rising sun. Perfect silence maintained sides, could hear hissing water, see frowning eyes warriors, came rushing on. When twenty yards distant, five six savages bow rose, and, laying aside paddles, took spears. Jack Peterkin raised oars, while, feeling madness whirling brain, I grasped paddle prepared onset. But us could strike blow, sharp prow war-canoe struck us like thunderbolt side, hurled us sea! What occurred I cannot tell, I nearly drowned; I recovered state insensibility I thrown, I found stretched back, bound hand foot Jack Peterkin, bottom large canoe. In condition lay whole day, time savages rested one hour. When night came, rested another hour, appeared sleep sat. But neither unbound allowed speak voyage, morsel food draught water given us. For food, however, cared little; would given much drop water cool parched lips, would glad, too, loosened cords bound us, tightly fastened occasioned us much pain. The air, also, unusually hot, much I felt convinced storm brewing. This also added sufferings. However, length relieved arrival island fled. While led ashore, caught glimpse Avatea, seated hinder part canoe. She fettered way. Our captors drove us towards hut Tararo, speedily arrived, found chief seated expression his face boded us good. Our friend teacher stood beside him, look anxiety his mild features. "How comes it," said Tararo, turning teacher, "that youths abused hospitality?" "Tell him," replied Jack, "that abused his hospitality, his hospitality extended us. I came island deliver Avatea, regret I failed so. If I get another chance, I try save her yet." The teacher shook his head. "Nay, young friend, I better tell that; incense him." "I care not," replied Jack. "If do not tell that, you will tell nothing, I will not say anything softer." On hearing Jack's speech, Tararo frowned his eye flashed anger. "Go," he said, "presumptuous boy. My debt cancelled. You companions shall die." As he spoke he rose signed several his attendants, seized Jack Peterkin violently collars, dragging us hut chief, led us wood outskirts village. Here thrust us species natural cave cliff, barricaded entrance, left us total darkness. After feeling time--for legs unshackled, although wrists still bound thongs--we found low ledge rock running along one side cavern. On seated ourselves, long time maintained unbroken silence. At last I could restrain feelings longer. "Alas! dear Jack Peterkin," said I, "what become us?--I fear doomed die." "I know not," replied Jack tremulous voice, "I know not. Ralph, I regret deeply hastiness violent temper, which, I must confess, chief brought sad condition. Perhaps teacher may something us. But I little hope." "Ah no!" said Peterkin heavy sigh, "I sure he cannot help us. Tararo does not care one his dogs." "Truly," said I, "there seems chance deliverance, unless Almighty puts forth His arm save us. Yet I must say I great hope, comrades; come dark place fault ours--unless fault try succour woman distress." I interrupted remarks noise entrance cavern, caused removal barricade. Immediately after, three men entered, taking us collars coats, led us away forest. As advanced, heard much shouting beating native drums village, first thought guards conducting us hut Tararo again. But mistaken. The beating drums gradually increased, soon observed procession natives coming towards us. At head procession placed, advanced together towards temple human victims will not sacrificed! A thrill horror ran heart I recalled mind awful scenes I witnessed dreadful spot. But deliverance came suddenly quarter whence little expected it. During whole day unusual degree heat atmosphere, sky assumed lurid aspect portends thunder-storm. Just approaching horrid temple, growl thunder burst overhead heavy drops rain began fall. Those witnessed gales storms tropical regions form faint conception fearful hurricane burst upon island Mango time. Before reached temple, storm burst upon us deafening roar, natives, knew well devastation follow, fled right left woods order save property, leaving us alone midst howling storm. The trees around us bent blast like willows, flee order seek shelter, teacher ran towards us knife his hand. "Thank Lord," he said, cutting bonds, "I time! Now, seek shelter nearest rock." This without moment's hesitation, whistling wind burst, ever anon, like thunder-claps among trees, tearing roots, hurled violence ground. Rain cut across land sheets, lightning played like forked serpents air, high roar hissing tempest thunder crashed burst rolled awful majesty. In village scene absolutely appalling. Roofs blown completely houses many cases, others houses levelled ground. In midst natives darting fro, instances saving goods, many others seeking save storm destruction whirled around them. But terrific although tempest land, still tremendous mighty ocean. Billows sprang, were, great deep, crests absolutely scattered white mist, fell upon beach crash seemed shake solid land. But end there. Each successive wave swept higher higher beach, ocean lashed angry waters among trees bushes, length, sheet white curdled foam, swept village upset carried off, dashed wreck, whole rows native dwellings! It sublime, awful scene, calculated, degree least, impress mind beholders might majesty God. We found shelter cave night next day, time storm raged fury; night following abated somewhat, morning went village seek food, famished hunger lost feeling danger wish escape desire satisfy cravings nature. But sooner obtained food began wish rather endeavoured make escape mountains. This attempted soon afterwards; natives able look us, showing disposition avoid observation make towards mountains, seized three warriors, bound wrists thrust us former prison. It true Jack made vigorous resistance, knocked first savage seized well-directed blow his fist, he speedily overpowered others. Thus prisoners, prospect torture violent death us. Chapter XXXIV Imprisonment--Sinking hopes--Unexpected freedom one, senses one. For long, long month remained dark dreary prison, dismal time see face human being, except silent savage brought us daily food. There one two seasons life I felt darkness sorrow desolation crushed inmost heart could never pass away death make cease feel. The present season. During first part confinement felt cold chill hearts every time heard footfall near cave--dreading lest prove executioner. But time dragged heavily on, ceased feel alarm, began experience deep, irrepressible longing freedom, chafed fretted confinement like tigers. Then feeling despair came us, actually longed time savages would take us forth die! But changes took place gradually, mingled sometimes brighter thoughts; times sat dark cavern ledge rock conversed almost pleasantly past, well-nigh forgot dreary present. But seldom ventured touch upon future. A decayed leaves boughs formed bed, scanty supply yams taro, brought us day, constituted food. "Well, Ralph, slept?" said Jack listless tone, rising one morning his humble couch. "Were much disturbed wind last night?" "No," said I; "I dreamed home night, I thought mother smiled upon me, beckoned go her; I could not, I chained." "And I dreamed, too," said Peterkin; "but happy home Coral Island. I thought swimming Water Garden; savages gave yell, immediately cave Spouting Cliff, which, somehow other, changed gloomy cavern; I awoke find true." Peterkin's tone much altered depressing influence his long imprisonment that, I known he spoke, I scarcely recognised it, sad it, unlike merry, cheerful voice accustomed hear. I pondered much, thought terrible decline happiness may come human beings short time; bright sunshine sky one time, short space dark overshadowing cloud! I doubt Bible would given much light comfort subject, I possessed one, I occasion regret deeply neglected store memory consoling truths. While I meditated thus, Peterkin broke silence cave saying, melancholy tone, "Oh, I wonder shall ever see dear island more!" His voice trembled, covering his face hands, he bent his head wept. It unusual sight see joyous companion tears, I felt burning desire comfort him; alas! could I say? I could hold hope; although I essayed twice speak, words refused pass lips. While I hesitated, Jack sat beside him, whispered words his ear; Peterkin threw his friend's breast, rested his head his shoulder. Thus sat time deep silence. Soon heard footsteps entrance cave, immediately jailer entered. We much accustomed his regular visits, however, paid little attention him, expecting he would set meagre fare, usual, depart. But surprise, instead so, he advanced towards us knife his hand, and, going Jack, he cut thongs bound his wrists, he Peterkin me! For fully five minutes stood speechless amazement, freed hands hanging idly sides. The first thought rushed mind time come put us death; although, I said before, actually wished death strength despair, thought drew really near, I felt natural love life revive heart, mingled chill horror suddenness call. But I mistaken. After cutting bonds, savage pointed cave's mouth, marched, almost mechanically, open air. Here, surprise, found teacher standing tree, his hands clasped him, tears trickling his dark cheeks. On seeing Jack, came first, he sprang towards him, and, clasping his arms, exclaimed--"Oh, dear young friend, great goodness God free!" "Free?" cried Jack. "Ay, free," repeated teacher, shaking us warmly hands again--"free go come will. The Lord unloosed bonds captive, set prisoners free, A missionary sent us, Tararo embraced Christian religion! The people even burning gods wood! Come, dear friends, see glorious sight." We could scarcely credit senses. So long accustomed cavern dream deliverance, imagined moment must surely nothing another vivid dream. Our eyes minds dazzled, too, brilliant sunshine, almost blinded us long confinement gloom prison, felt giddy variety conflicting emotions filled throbbing bosoms; followed footsteps sable friend, beheld bright foliage trees, heard cries paroquets, smelt rich perfume flowering shrubs, truth, really delivered prison death, rushed overwhelming power souls, one accord, tears sprang eyes, uttered loud, long cheer joy. It replied shout number natives chanced near. Running towards us, shook us hand every demonstration kindly feeling. They fell behind, forming sort procession, conducted us dwelling Tararo. The scene met eyes one I shall never forget. On rude bench front his house sat chief. A native stood his left hand, his dress seemed teacher. On his right stood English gentleman, I rightly concluded missionary. He tall, thin, apparently past forty, bald forehead thin grey hair. The expression his countenance winning I ever saw, his clear grey eye beamed look frank, fearless, loving, truthful. In front chief open space, centre lay pile wooden idols, ready set fire; around assembled thousands natives, come join witness unusual sight. A bright smile overspread missionary's face he advanced quickly meet us, he shook us warmly hands. "I overjoyed meet you, dear young friends," he said. "My friend _your_ friend, teacher, told history; I thank Father heaven, heart, He guided island, made instrument saving you." We thanked missionary heartily, asked surprise he succeeded turning heart Tararo favour. "I tell convenient time," he answered; "meanwhile must forget respect due chief. He waits receive you." In conversation immediately followed us Tararo, latter said light Gospel Jesus Christ sent island, indebted freedom. Moreover, he told us liberty depart schooner whenever pleased, supplied much provision required. He concluded shaking hands us warmly, performing ceremony rubbing noses. This indeed good news us, could hardly find words express gratitude chief missionary. "And Avatea?" inquired Jack. The missionary replied pointing group natives midst girl stood. Beside her tall, strapping fellow, whose noble mien air superiority bespoke chief ordinary kind. "That youth her lover. He came morning his war-canoe treat Tararo Avatea. He married days, afterwards returns his island home his bride!" "That is capital," said Jack, he stepped savage gave hearty shake hand. "I wish joy, lad; too, Avatea." As Jack spoke, Avatea's lover took hand led spot Tararo missionary stood, surrounded chief men tribe. The girl herself followed, stood his left hand her lover stood his right, and, commanding silence, made following speech, translated missionary:-- "Young friend, seen years, head old. Your heart also large brave. I Avatea debtors, wish, midst assembly, acknowledge debt, say one never repay. You risked life one known days. But she woman distress, enough secure her aid Christian man. We, live islands sea, know true Christians always act thus. Their religion one love kindness. We thank God many Christians sent here; hope many come. Remember I Avatea think pray brave comrades far away." To kind speech Jack returned short, sailor-like reply, he insisted he done Avatea he would done woman sun. But Jack's forte lie speech-making, he terminated rather abruptly seizing chief's hand shaking violently, he made hasty retreat. "Now then, Ralph Peterkin," said Jack, mingled crowd, "it seems object came satisfactorily accomplished, nothing get ready sea fast can, hurrah dear old England!" "That is idea precisely," said Peterkin, endeavouring wink; he wept much late, poor fellow, he found difficult. "However, I am going away till I see fellows burn gods." Peterkin his wish, minutes afterwards fire put pile, roaring flames ascended, amid acclamations assembled thousands false gods Mango reduced ashes! Chapter XXXV CONCLUSION To part lot mankind. The world scene constant leave-taking, hands grasp cordial greeting to-day doomed ere long unite last time, quivering lips pronounce word--"Farewell." It sad thought, account exclude minds? May lesson worth learning gathered contemplation it? May not, perchance, teach us devote thoughts frequently attentively land meet, part more? How many part world light good-bye never see again! Often I think, meditations subject, realised fully shortness fleeting intercourse world many fellow-men, would try earnestly good, give friendly smile, were, passing (for longest intercourse earth little passing word glance), show sympathy short, quick struggle life, kindly words looks actions. The time soon drew near quit islands South Seas; strange though may appear, felt deep regret parting natives island Mango: embraced Christian faith, sought, showing us utmost kindness, compensate harsh treatment experienced hands: felt growing affection native teachers missionary, especially Avatea her husband. Before leaving many long interesting conversations missionary, one he told us he making island Rarotonga, his native-built sloop blown course, violent gale, driven island. At first natives refused listen he say; week's residence among them, Tararo came said he wished become Christian, would burn his idols. He proved sincere, for, seen, he persuaded his people likewise. I use word "persuaded" advisedly; for, like Feejee chiefs, Tararo despot, might commanded obedience his wishes; he entered readily spirit new faith, he perceived impropriety using constraint propagation it. He set example, therefore; example followed almost every man tribe. During short time remained island, repairing vessel getting her ready sea, natives commenced building large commodious church, superintendence missionary, several rows new cottages marked out; place bid fair become, months, prosperous beautiful Christian village end island. After Avatea married, she her husband sent away loaded presents, chiefly edible nature. One native teachers went them, purpose visiting still distant islands sea, spreading, possible, light glorious Gospel there. As missionary intended remain several weeks longer, order encourage confirm his new converts, Jack Peterkin I held consultation cabin schooner--which found left her, everything taken her restored. We resolved delay departure longer. The desire see beloved native land strong upon us, could wait. Three natives volunteered go us Tahiti, thought likely able procure sufficient crew sailors man vessel, accepted offer gladly. It bright, clear morning hoisted snow-white sails pirate schooner left shores Mango. The missionary thousands natives came bid us God-speed, see us sail away. As vessel bent light, fair wind, glided quickly lagoon cloud canvas. Just passed channel reef natives gave us loud cheer; missionary waved his hat, he stood coral rock his grey hairs floating wind, heard single word "Farewell" borne faintly sea. That night, sat taffrail gazing upon wide sea starry firmament, thrill joy, strangely mixed sadness, passed hearts; length "homeward bound," gradually leaving far behind us beautiful, bright green coral islands Pacific Ocean. THE END
