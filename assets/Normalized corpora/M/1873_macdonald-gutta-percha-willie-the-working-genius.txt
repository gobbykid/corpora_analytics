 GUTTA-PERCHA WILLIE: THE WORKING GENIUS THE HISTORY OF GUTTA-PERCHA WILLIE. CHAPTER I. WHO HE WAS AND WHERE HE WAS. When he school three weeks, boys called Six-fingered Jack; his real name Willie, his father mother gave him--not William, Willie, brother his father, died young, always called Willie. His name full Willie Macmichael. It generally pronounced Macmickle, was, learned anthropologist, certain reasons appear history, supposed original form name, dignified course time Macmichael. It his father, however, gave name Gutta-Percha Willie, reason also show by. Mr Macmichael country doctor, living small village thinly-peopled country; first result he hard work, he often ride many miles see patient, unfrequently middle night; second that, hard work, he little pay, thinly-peopled country generally poor country, live poor also, cannot spend much even upon health. But doctor preferred country life, although he would glad richer patients, within less distances other, he would say one expressed surprise that, his reputation, he remain he was--"What is become little flock I go away, doctors experience would feel inclined come undertake work. I know every man, woman, child whole country-side, makes difference." You see, therefore, he good kind-hearted man, loved his work, sake he helped it, better money he received it. Their home necessarily humble one--a neat little cottage village Priory Leas--almost one pretty spot thereabout. It lay valley midst hills, look high, rose gentle slope, bold elevations grand-shaped peaks. But rose good height notwithstanding, weather top wintertime often bitter fierce--bitter keen frost, fierce wild winds ever blew. Of frost wind village feet share too, course bad below, hills shelter wind, always colder farther go away heart warm ball rock earth upon live. When Willie's father riding across great moorland desolate hills, people village would saying bitterly cold was, he would thinking snug warm there, nice would turn certain corner road back, slip freezing wind way among withered gorse heather wide expanse he pursued his dreary journey. For his part, Willie cared little weather was, took came. In hot summer, he would lie long grass get cool; cold winter, he would scamper get warm. When his hands cold icicles, his cheeks would red apples. When his mother took his hands hers, chafed them, full pity suffering, she thought it, Willie first knew cold sweet warmth kind hands chafed them: he thought before. Climbing amongst ruins Priory, playing Farmer Thomson's boys girls ricks his yard, thin clear saffron twilight came early noon, when, people, every breath seemed full needle-points, sharp cold, he comfortable happy he creature winter only, found quite home it. For ruins, pretty large ruins too, called Priory. It often monks chose poor country settle in, I suppose reasons. And I dare say monks all, begging friars, founded wanted reprove luxury greed monks; perhaps time grown bad themselves, place nearly finished, could well move it. They had, however, I indicated, chosen one pretty spot, around which, short distance every side, land tolerably good, grew excellent oats poor wheat, gardens equal apples pears, besides abundance gooseberries, currants, strawberries. The ruins Priory lay behind Mr Macmichael's cottage--indeed, garden--of which, along house, he purchased fen--that is, place his own, long he paid small sum--not fifteen shillings year, I think--to his superior. How long since Priory come looked upon mere encumbrance cottage garden, nobody thereabouts knew; although time I presume archaeologists ferreted everything concerning it, nobody except owner taken trouble make least inquiry history. To Willie Priory, naturally his father's garden every garden similar ruins adorn encumber it, according owner might choose regard presence. The ruins considerable extent, remains Gothic arches, carvings doors--all open sky except places ground-level vaulted. These still perfectly solid, used family outhouses store wood peats, keep garden tools in, like purposes. In summer, golden flowers grew broken walls; winter, grey frosts edged sky. I fancy whole garden space occupied huge building, surface irregular I ever saw garden. It down, down, whatever direction went, mounded heaps ruins, mould gathered. For many years bushes flowers grown upon them, might dig good way without coming stones, though come must last. The walks wound heaps, thick walls ruin, overgrown lichens mosses, passing arched door window ancient building. It generous garden old-fashioned flowers vegetables. There apple pear trees also wall faced south, regarded Willie mingled respect desire, he allowed touch them, gooseberries he allowed eat many he pleased ripe, currants too, his mother many she wanted preserves. Some spots much shady allow either fruit flowers grow them, high close walls. But I need say garden now, I shall occasion refer again, I must tell I know once, else I make story it? CHAPTER II. WILLIE'S EDUCATION. Willie good deal nine years age he could read single word. It he stupid, shall soon see, he learned good reading, therefore begun wish read; his father unusual ideas he ought educated. He said he would think making Willie learn read he wished taught he would make eat he was not hungry. The gift reading, he said, good thing give he wished it, knew value it. "Would give watch," he would say, "before he cares know whether sun rises east west, hour dinner ready?" Now I sure would work boys girls. I afraid might never learn read boys girls wanted better than, ignorance, themselves. But worked well Willie's case, neither lazy idle. And must supposed he left without education all. For one thing, his father mother used talk freely him--much parents presence children; nothing serves better teaching conversation good thoughtful people. While talked, Willie would sit listening intently, trying understand he heard; although unfrequently took strange shapes his little mind, times he understood neither words things words represented, yet much he understand make good use of. For instance, he soon came know his father mother little money spare, his father work hard get money had. He learned also everything came house, done them, cost money; therefore, one thing, he must ill-use his clothes. He learned, too, great deal suffering world, his father's business try make less, help people ill grow well again, able work; made see useful man his father was, wish also good world. Then he looked saw great many ways getting money, is, great many things people would give money; he saw ways better others, he thought his father's way best all. I give specimens lessons he learned listening his father mother talked together. But he another teacher. Down street village, straggling, nearly many little gardens houses it, house occupied several poor people, one end which, consisting room closet, old woman lived got her money spinning flax yarn making linen. She kind-hearted old creature--widow, without relation near help her look her. She one child, died he old Willie. That forty years before, she never forgotten her little Willie, his name too, she fancied Willie like him. Nothing, therefore, pleased her better get her little room, talk him. She would take little bit sugar-candy liquorice her cupboard him, tell strange old fairy tale legend, she sat spinning, last she made fond her he would often go stay hours her. Nor make much difference his mother begged Mrs Wilson give something sweet then, she afraid his going see old woman merely she gave him, would greedy. But fact was, he liked her stories better her sugar-candy liquorice; things he delighted watching wonderful wheel go round round fast he could find whether her foot making spin, making her foot dance curious way. After she explained well she could, he thought he understood it, seemed wonderful mysterious; ever went whirring round, sung song own, also song story, whatever was, old woman telling him, he sat listening her high soft chair, covered long-faded chintz, cushioned like nest. For Mrs Wilson better house live once, chair, well chest drawers dark mahogany, brass handles, stood opposite window, part furniture she saved she sell rest; well was, she used say, her old rheumatic bones she saved chair least. In chair, then, little boy would sit coiled nearly ball might be, like young bird rabbit nest, staring wheel, listening two ears one heart song old woman's tale once. [Illustration: "WILLIE LIKED MRS WILSON'S STORIES BETTER THAN HER SUGAR CANDY."] One sultry summer afternoon, his mother well gone lie down, his father out, he often was, upon Scramble old horse, Tibby, servant, busy ironing, Willie ran Widow Wilson's, soon curled chair, like little Hindoo idol grown weary sitting upright, tumbled corner. Now, he came, old woman thinking him, wishing much he would come; turning also her mind, she spun, her stock stories, hope finding nook one she yet told him; although he yet begun grow tired even he knew best, special treat new one; time Mrs Wilson's store exhausted, new one turned rarely. This time, however, she successful, call mind one she thought before. It grown dusty, full little holes, she set darning needle thread her imagination, that, time Willie arrived, she treat, she thought, quite ready him. I going tell story, poor boy received fairy he shown kindness gift marvelous wand, shape common blackthorn walking-stick, nobody could suspect possessing wonderful virtue. By means it, he able anything he wished, without least trouble; so, upon trial skill, appointed certain king, order find craftsmen his realm fittest aid ruling it, he found easy surpass every one them, his trade. He produced richer damask silk-weavers; finer linen linen-weavers; complicated well ornate cabinet, drawers quaint hiding-places, cabinet-makers; sword-blade cunningly damasked, hilt gorgeously jewelled, sword-makers; ring set stones precious, brilliant colour, beautifully combined, jewellers: short, I say, without knowing single device one arts question, he surpassed every one competitors his craft, favour king office he wished confer, and, I remember rightly, gained length king's daughter boot. For long time Willie uttered single exclamation, old woman looked up, fancying he must asleep, she saw, her disappointment, cloud upon his face--amounting frown. "What is matter you, Willie, chick?" she asked. "Have got headache?" "No, thank you, Mrs Wilson," answered Willie; "but I do not like story all." "I am sorry that. I thought I sure please time; one I never told before, I quite forgotten till afternoon. Why do not like it?" "Because he cheat. _He_ could not things; fairy's wand them." "But he good lad, kind fairy." "That makes difference. He _wasn't_ good. And fairy was not good either, she would not set wicked things." "They were not wicked things. They first-rate--everything he made--better one else could make them." "But he did not make them. There was not one poor fellows he cheated was not better man he. The worst could something his hands, I do not believe he could anything, he ever tried he would hated sneak. He cheated king, too, princess, everybody. Oh! should not I like there, beaten wand all! For somebody might able make things better still, he known how." Mrs Wilson disappointed--perhaps little ashamed she thought before; anyhow she grew cross; she cross, she grew unfair, said Willie-- "You think great deal yourself, Master Willie! Pray could idle little hands do, try?" "I do not know, I have not tried," answered Willie. "It is pity should not," she rejoined, "if think would turn clever." She did not mean anything crossness she said this--for probably severe rheumatic twinge passed her shoulder also partly blame. But Willie took her quite seriously, asked tone showed he wanted accounted for-- "Why have not I ever done anything, Mrs Wilson?" "You ought know best yourself," she answered, still cross. "I suppose do not like work. Your good father mother work hard, I am sure. It is shame idle." This rather hard boy seven, Willie then. It made look grave indeed, unhappy, little while, he sat turning thing his mind. "Is wrong play about, Mrs Wilson?" he asked, pause considerable duration. "No, indeed, dear," she answered; pause she begun sorry spoken roughly her little darling. "Does everybody work?" "Everybody that is worth anything, old enough," she added. "Does God work?" he asked, another pause, low voice. "No, child. What He work for?" "If everybody works good old enough, I think God must work," answered Willie. "But I ask papa. Am I old enough?" "Well, you are old enough much, might something." "What could I do? Could I spin, Mrs Wilson?" "No, child; that is easy thing do; could knit." "Could I? What good would do?" "Why, could knit mother pair stockings." "Could I though? Will teach me, Mrs Wilson?" Mrs Wilson readily promised, foreseeing she might good deal little man's company, indeed he earnest; she lonely, never happy he her. She said she would get knitting-needles--wires she called them--that evening; she wool, he came to-morrow, she would soon see whether he old enough clever enough learn knit. She advised him, however, say nothing his mother till she made her mind whether he could learn; he could, he might surprise her taking her something his knitting--at least pair muffetees keep her wrists warm winter. Willie went home solemn his secret. The next day he began learn, although his fingers annoyed good deal first refusing exactly he wanted them, soon became obedient; new year arrived, he actually knitted pair warm white lamb's-wool stockings his mother. I bound confess first finished good deal soiled way long, perhaps partly little hands always clean might he turned play work; Mrs Wilson washed herself, looked, white snow, least white whitest lamb ever saw. I attempt describe delight his mother, triumph Willie, gratification his father, saw good promise his boy's capacity; I written hitherto introductory story, I long begin tell regular straightforward fashion. Before I begin, however, I must forget tell Willie ask his father question Mrs Wilson's answer he satisfied--I mean question whether God worked; his father's answer, he sat pondering his chair, something effect:-- "Yes, Willie; seems God works anybody--for He works night day, and, I remember rightly, Jesus tells us somewhere He works Sunday too. If He stop working, everything would stop being. The sun would stop shining, moon stars; corn would stop growing; would apples gooseberries; eyes would stop seeing; ears would stop hearing; fingers could not move inch; and, worst all, little heart would stop loving." "No, papa," cried Willie; "I should not stop loving, I am sure." "Indeed would, Willie." "Not mamma." "Yes; would not love us dead asleep without dreaming." "That would dreadful." "Yes would. So see good God us--to go working, may able love other." "Then God works like day long, must fine thing work," said Willie. "You right. It fine thing work--the finest thing world, comes love, God's work does." This conversation made Willie quite determined learn knit; God worked, he would work too. And although work he undertook small work, like God's great works, every loop he made little love looped it, like invisible, softest, downiest lining stockings. And those, he went knitting pair his father; indeed, although he learned work needle well, darn stockings he made, even tried his hand spinning--of which, however, he could make much long time--he left knitting come begin story next chapter. CHAPTER III. HE IS TURNED INTO SOMETHING HE NEVER WAS BEFORE. Hitherto I mixing summer winter everything together, I going try keep everything place. Willie nine years old. His mother poorly time--confined her room, she unfrequently long cold winters. It winter now; one morning, air dark falling snow, he standing parlour window, looking it, wondering whether angels made sky; he thought might sawdust, which, much, shook get melted put way; Tibby came room softly, looking, he thought, strange. "Willie, mamma wants you," she said; Willie hastened up-stairs his mother's room. Dark air outside, he surprised find dark room was. And surprised curious noise he heard moment he entered it, like noise hedgehog, little creature fields woods. But he crept gently his mother's bed, saying-- "Are better morning, mamma?" And she answered feeble sweet voice-- "Yes, Willie, much better. And, Willie, God sent little sister." "O-o-o-oh!" cried Willie. "A little sister! Did He make her Himself?" "Yes; He made her Himself; sent her last night." "How busy He must lately!" said Willie. "Where she? I _should_ like see her. Is she sister?" "Yes, sister, Willie--to love take care always." "Where she?" "Go ask nurse let see her." Then Willie saw strange woman room, something lying her lap. He went her, she folded back corner blanket, revealed face bigger big doll clergyman's house, alive, quite alive--such pretty little face! He stood staring while. "May I kiss her, nurse?" "Yes--gently--quite gently." He kissed her, half afraid, he know what. Her cheek softer smoother anything he ever touched before. He sped back his mother, full delight speak. But she yet well enough talk him, his father coming in, led down-stairs again, he began watch snow, wondering anything baby's arrival. In afternoon, found lock his mother's room would catch easily, made noise disturbed her. So his father got screwdriver removed it, making little noise he could. Next he contrived way, piece string, keeping door shut, would hold close enough, hung shawl keep draught out--all proceeding Willie watched. As soon he finished, nurse closed door behind them, Mr Macmichael set take lock smithy, allowed Willie go him. By time reached it, snow inch deep shoulders, Willie's cap, his father's hat. How red glow smith's fire looked! It great black cavern red heart midst whiteness. The smith great powerful man, bare arms, blackened face. When entered, he two men making axle wheel. They great lump red-hot iron anvil, knocking big hole it--not boring it, knocking big punch. One men, pair tongs-like pincers, held punch steady hole, two struck head alternate blows mighty hammers called sledges, took strength two brawny arms heave high head great round swing shoulder, might come right good force, drive punch glowing iron, was, I judge, four inches thick. All Willie thought he could understand, he knew fire made hardest metal soft; he could not understand this: every stopped heaving mighty sledges, third man took punch hole, smith himself, whose name Willet (and _will it_ he vengeance, he anything anvil him), caught his tongs his hand, picked little bit black coal tongs, dropped hole punch been, took fire immediately blazed up. Then went punch again, huge hammering commenced, bangs blows, smith wise floor his smithy, would surely knocked hole that, though able knock anvil halfway earth, giant smith story did. While going on, Mr Macmichael, perceiving operation ought interrupted surgical one, stood quite still waiting, Willie stood also--absorbed staring, gradually creeping nearer nearer anvil, sparks flying make dangerous eyes, would striking iron instead punch. As soon punch driven through, smith dropped his sledge-hammer, begun wipe his forehead, Willie spoke. "Mr Willet," he said, he knew every man standing village name profession, "why put bits coal hole making? I thought would way rather help you." "So would, little man," answered Willet, grim though grimy smile, "if did not take fire keep getting way time kept heat. You see depend heat getting through, it is much less trouble drop bit coal two hole, take big axle lay fire again, mention time quantity coal would take heat afresh." "But little bits coal could not much?" said Willie. "They could enough, that is less saving," said smith, one men thing right give reason it. "You see I able put little bits right place." "I see! I see!" cried Willie. "I understand! But, papa, think Mr Willet proper person ask set lock right?" "I have not doubt it," said Mr Macmichael, taking his greatcoat pocket, unfolding piece paper he wrapped it. "Why make question it?" "Because look great big huge things he does! How could tremendous hammers set little thing right? They would knock pieces. Do not think better take watchmaker?" "If I did, Willie, know would say moment saw work?" "No, papa. What I say?" "You would say, 'Do not think, papa, better take back smith?" "But I say that?" "Because, saw his tools beside lock, would think tools small lock huge, nothing could done them. Yet I daresay watchmaker could set lock right he chose try. Do not think so, Mr Willet?" "Not doubt it," answered smith. "Had better go then?" "Well," answered smith, smiling, "I think perhaps he would ask had not come me. No doubt he could it, I have got better tools purpose. Let look lock. I am sure I shall able set right." "Not great big hammer, then," said Willie. "No; I smaller hammers that. When want it, sir?" "Could manage once, let take home, there is little baby there, arrived?" "You do not mean it!" said smith, looking surprised. "I wish joy, sir." "And lock room she is in," continued doctor. "And you are afraid her getting flying again!" said smith. "I once. There is not much wrong it, I daresay. I hope Mrs Macmichael well, sir." He took lock, drew several screws it, forced open. "It is nothing spring gone," he said, he took something threw away. Then he took several pieces, cleaned all. Then he searched box till he found another spring, he put instead broken one, snipping little bit pair pincers. Then he put pieces in, put cover it, gave something taps tiny hammer, replaced screws, said-- "Shall I come put you, sir?" "No, no; I much," said Mr Macmichael. "I easily manage that. Come, Willie. I am much obliged once. Good-night." Then went snowstorm again, Willie holding fast his father's hand. "This good," said his father. "Your mother better day to-morrow, perhaps longer sleep to-night it. You see easy useful kind sometimes. The smith mother minutes ten doctors could done. Think his great black fingers making little sleep rest warmth her--and minutes!" "Suppose he could not done it," said Willie. "Do think watchmaker could?" "That I cannot tell, I do not think likely. We probably get new one." "Suppose could not get new one?" "Then set wits work, contrive way fastening door, mamma should not take cold open, yet disturbed noise it." "It would nice able everything!" said Willie. "So would; nobody can; it is well, need much help other, would independent." "Then should not body try many things he can?" "Yes, there is fear ever able without people, would often able help them. Both smith watch maker could mend lock, neither could without that." When Willie went bed, he lay awake long time, thinking how, lock could mended, had, he could contrived keep door shut properly. In morning, however, he told his father he thought way would do, though he could contrive shut open door well enough, he could think person outside might able it; he thought best way, difficulty occur, would take lock his door, put mamma's till better one could got. Of suggestion his father, much Willie's satisfaction, entirely approved. CHAPTER IV. HE SERVES AN APPRENTICESHIP. Willie's mother grew better, Willie's sister grew bigger; strange nurse went away, Willie his mother Tibby, little occasional assistance doctor, managed baby amongst them. Considering she yet short time school, she behaved wonderfully well. She never cried except she trouble, even could seldom seen tear her face. She required her, grew longer broader heavier, fond lighted candle. The fault she she would not give Willie quite many smiles he wanted. As view she took affairs, she seemed long time whole well satisfied life gifts. But last troubles began overtake her, she approve all. The first thing she objected weaned, she evidently considered cruel unnecessary experience. But her father said must be, her mother, believing know best, carried his decree. Little Agnes endured tolerably well daytime, night protested lustily--was indeed outrageously indignant, one evening following conversation took place tea-table, Willie sat heard it. "Really, dear," said Mrs Macmichael, "I cannot rest disturbed way another night. You must go Willie's room, let manage little squalling thing myself." "Why should not I take share trouble?" objected her husband. "Because may called moment, sleep till next night; fair sleep work let unnecessarily broken. It is I could not manage without you." "But Willie's bed big enough us," he objected. "Then Willie come sleep me." "But Willie wants his sleep much I mine." "There is fear him: he would sleep though babies Priory Leas crying room." "Would I really?" thought Willie, feeling rather ashamed himself. "But get warm milk-and-water you?" pursued his father. "Oh! I manage quite well." "Could not I that, mamma?" said Willie, humbly, he thought his mother said his sleeping powers. "No, pet," she answered; he said more. "It seems me," said his father, "a clumsy necessity. I thinking it. To keep fire night warm tiny drop water she wants, I must say, seems like using steam-engine sweep crumbs. If would get stone bottle, fill boiling water, wrap piece flannel it, lay anywhere bed, would quite hot enough even morning make milk warm she ought it." "If go Willie's room, let Willie come sleep me, I try it," she said. Mr Macmichael consented; straightway Willie filled silent delight thought sleeping his mother baby. Nor only; he resolved within he would try get share business night: his mother little sleep rather himself? They might least divide little them! So he went bed early, full thought waking soon Agnes begin cry, finding he could do. Already he begun useful daytime, twice put her sleep his mother Tibby failed. And although he quite understood probability he would succeeded had not tried first, yet relief them, confessed it. But he woke, lay his mother his sister sound asleep; sun shining blind; he heard Tibby house; and, short, time get up. At breakfast, his father said him-- "Well, Willie, Agnes behave herself last night?" "So well!" answered Willie; "she never cried once." "O Willie!" said his mother, laughing, "she screamed whole hour, hungry she emptied her bottle without stopping once. You sound asleep time, never stirred." Willie much ashamed himself, although he was not least blame, he could hardly keep crying. He say another word, except he spoken to, breakfast, his father mother puzzled think could matter him: He went greater part morning moodily thinking; advice betook Mrs Wilson, gave her full attention, suggested several things, none which, however, seemed likely succeed. "If I could go bed mamma asleep," he said, "I could tie string hair, slip loop end mamma's wrist, she sat attend Agnes, she would pull hair wake me. Would not she wonder she felt pulling _her_?" He go home without help Mrs Wilson. All way he kept thinking something fashion-- "Mamma will not wake me, Agnes cannot; worst everybody else fast asleep I shall be. Let see--who _is_ that is awake night? There is cat: I think she is, she would not know wake me, even I could teach her wake moment Agnes cried, I do not think she would nice one it; I did not come awake pat her velvety pin-cushions, she might turn points pins them, scratch awake. There is clock; it is always awake; cannot tell time till go ask it. I think might made wind string pull right time came; I do not think I could teach it. And came pull, pull might stop clock, would papa say then? They tell owls night, they are good, I am certain. I do not see I _am_ do. I wonder God would wake I ask Him?" I do not know whether Willie ask God wake him. I inquire, goes kind, better talk much about. What I know is, he fell asleep his head heart full desire wake help his mother; that, middle night, he wake suddenly, little Agnes screaming her might. He sat bed instantly. "What is matter, Willie?" said his mother. "Lie go sleep." "Baby's crying," said Willie. "Never mind. I will manage her." "Do know, mamma, I think I waked time help you. I will take her you, perhaps she take her drink me." "Nonsense, Willie. Lie down, pet." "But I have thinking it, mamma. Do remember, yesterday, Agnes would take her bottle you, screamed screamed; Tibby took her, she gave drank all? Perhaps she would me." [Illustration: "WILLIE SAT DOWN WITH THE BABY ON HIS KNEES, AND SHE STOPPED CRYING."] As he spoke he slipped bed, held his arms take baby. The light already coming in, little, blind, summer. He heard cow lowing fields back house, he wondered whether her baby woke her. The next moment he little Agnes his arms, his mother thought he might well try, seeing he awake. "Do take care do not let her fall, Willie." "That I will, mamma. I have got her tight. Now give bottle, please." "I have not got ready yet; woke minute she began cry." So Willie walked room Agnes till his mother got her bottle filled nice warm milk-and-water little sugar. When she gave him, he sat baby his knees, and, his great delight, satisfaction his mother well, she stopped crying, began drink milk-and-water. "Why, you are born nurse, Willie!" said his mother. But moment baby heard her mother's voice, she forsook bottle, began scream, wanting go her. "O mamma! must not speak, please; course she likes better bottle; speak reminds her you. It Tibby yesterday. Or must speak, speak sound, soft, sweet way." A moments after, Willie startled gruff voice room he nearly dropped bottle; his mother following his directions. The plan quite successful, baby suspicion voice her mother's, paid heed it, attended her bottle. Mr Macmichael, country, creeping stair his room, fearful disturbing his wife, he hear man's voice he supposed! he think robbers broken in! Of course he went his wife's room first. There he heard voice plainly enough door, he opened he could see one except Willie feeding baby ottoman foot bed. When his wife explained was, laughed heartily Willie's suggestion leaving imagination little Agnes repose; henceforth he installed night-nurse, long process weaning last; proud his promotion he was. He slept sound ever, he anxiety waking; his mother always woke instant Agnes began cry. "Willie!" she would say, "Willie! here is baby wanting you." And Willie would start, sometimes he able open his eyes, little boys' eyelids occasionally obstinate. And he jumped bed crying, "Where she, mamma? I have lost her!" he dreaming her. You may sure his mamma let long sleep morning always, make disturbed night. Agnes throve well, notwithstanding weaning. She soon got reconciled bottle, Willie slept peace. CHAPTER V. HE GOES TO LEARN A TRADE. Time passed, Willie grew. Have readers ever thought meant growing? It far meaning get bigger stronger. It means become able understand wonder things you. There people understand, wonder less; growing straight; growing crooked. There two ways growing. You may growing up, may growing down; once, growing crooked. There people growing understanding, goodness. It beautiful fact, however, cannot grow goodness understanding; great probability is, that, growing better, begin grow stupid. Those growing right way, understand, wonder; learn do, want do. Willie boy kind. I do not care write boys girls, men women, growing right way. They interesting enough write about. But he one grow: Agnes grew well; Willie grew capable helping her, he found Agnes required him. It long time, however, he knew much he obliged Agnes requiring much him. She grew grew she capable doll; course doll given her--not new one bought, respectable old doll, big one her mother's she little girl, she wise enough put her trunk she left her mother's house go home Mr Macmichael. She made new clothes now, Tibby made cloak bonnet her wear she went doors. But struck Willie her shoes, cloth, unfit walking, he thought doctor's family something quite amazing that, head shoulders properly looked after, feet remain utterly neglected. It clear must his part affair; could anybody else's, case one else would attended it. He must see it. I think I said Willie knew almost everybody village, I might added everybody without exception knew him. He favourite--first all, his father much loved trusted; next, his mother spoke kindly her husband's poor patients richer ones; last, he spoke everybody proper respect. Some people, however, he knew course better others. Of Mrs Wilson know one. But I believe I also mentioned house she lived poor people. In room opposite hers, ground-floor, lived worked shoemaker--a man neither wife child, nor, far people knew, near relative all. He far good health, although he worked morning night, constant pain his back, rather crooked, indeed little hump it. If his temper always best, I wonder cleverest watches steam-engines would go well he twist back? To see seated his low stool--in which, way, low enough, he sat leather-covered hole, perhaps sake softness spring leather--with his head body bent forward his lapstone his last, his right hand quick broad-headed hammer hammering piece sole-leather; his hands meeting little friendly chat something small, suddenly starting asunder astonished anger, portentous hiss, might taken automaton moved springs, imitating human actions wonderful manner--so regular machine-like his motions, little he seem think he at. A little passing attention, hint his head, sufficient keep his hands right, used work, well taught his head, could pretty nearly made pair shoes themselves; shoemaking trade one admits great deal thought going head hangs work, like sun earth ripening harvest. Shoemakers distinguished poetry prose; Hector Macallaster done neither, he could yet think, people write poetry prose cannot do. But infinitely importance able think well merely write ever well; and, besides, think well everybody ought become able do. Hector odd ways looking things, I need say that, soon plain enough. Ever since illness he risen weak spine, ever-working brain, quiet heart, he shown merely good sort man, he always been, religious man; saying much, he modest even shyness grown people, solemnity his look great word spoken, his unblamable behaviour, readiness he would lend give his small earnings his poor neighbours. The thing anybody could complain his temper; showed occasionally, almost everybody made excuse ground his bodily ailments. He gave quarter himself, however. He said clergyman, he lamenting trouble he it, sought comfort saying caused weakness his health-- "No, sir--excuse me; nobody knows much I indebted crooked back. If were not I might bad temper never know it. But drives hole, I see ugly head I know it is there, try starve death. But oh dear! it is creature burrow! When I think I have built round, comes head place I never looked see it, it is again!" You understand already shoemaker thought his fashion, way everybody think think. What he thought his trade things shall see by. When Willie entered his room, he greeted friendly nod; he fond children, he special favour Willie, chiefly he considered greatly indebted something he said Mrs Wilson, given good deal think about. For Mrs Wilson often chat Hector, she would unfrequently talk Willie, whose friendship she proud. She told strange question he put her whether God worked, shoemaker, thinking it, come conclusion Willie's father, great comfort help him. "What I to-day, Willie?" he said; part country say _Master_ _Miss_. "You look," he added, "if wanted something." "I want teach me, please," answered Willie. "To teach what?" asked Hector. "To make shoes, please," answered Willie. "Ah! think would prudent me? Do not see, I teach make shoes, people would coming make shoes them, would become then?" "But I want make shoes Aggy's doll. She ought not go without shoes weather, know." "Certainly not. Well, bring doll I take her measure make her pair." "But I do not think papa could afford pay shoes doll well us. You see, though would better, it is necessary doll strong shoes. She shoes good enough indoors, she need not walk wet. Do not think yourself, Hector?" "But," returned Hector, "I shall happy make Agnes present pair shoes her doll. I should not think charging papa that. He far good man made pay everything." "But," objected Willie, "to let make nothing would bad make papa pay necessary. Please, must let make Aggy. Besides, she is old enough yet even say thank them." "Then she will not old enough say thank either," said Hector, who, time, losing moment his work, stitching away, bore, twiddle, hiss, sole huge boot. "Ah! see, she is own--so does not matter!" If I writing big book, instead little one, I tempted say set Hector thinking, made think well. Instead replying, however, he laid his boot, rose, first taking shelf whole skin calf-leather, next low chair corner room, he set latter near his seat opposite window. "Sit there, then, Willie," he said; adding, he handed calf-skin, "There is leather, tools service. Make shoes, welcome. I shall glad company." Having thus spoken, he sat again, caught his boot hurriedly, began stitching away bare life. Willie took calf-skin his lap, somewhat bewildered. If he asked cut pair seven-leagued boots ogre, would seemed his eyes enough leather one skin. But ever he find two pieces small enough doll's shoes ocean leather? He began turn round round, looking along edge, Hector casting sidelong glances midst his busyness, curiosity his face his desire conceal caused look grim instead amused. Willie, although he never yet considered shoes made, seen nothing could done he got command manageable bit leather; he found much shade better little; he saw would not wise cut piece anywhere, might spoil would serve large pair shoes even boots. Therefore he kept turning skin round he came small projecting piece. This he contemplated time, trying recall size Dolly's feet, make his mind whether would large enough one even shoes. A smile passed Hector's face--a smile satisfaction. "That is it!" he said last. "I think you will do. That is first thing--to consider stuff, see much make it. Waste thing good shoemaker ever yet could endure. It is bad itself, unworkmanlike! Yes, I think corner do. Shall I cut you?" "No, thank you--not yet, please. I think I must go look her feet, I cannot recollect _quite_ big are. I will run home look." "Do think able carry exact size head, bring back you?" "Yes, I think I shall." "I do not. I never could trust far that, nearly. You might pretty nigh one way wrong another, consider length breadth roundabout. I tell best way _you_ do. Set doll standing bit paper, draw pencil round her foot point close paper. Both feet better, would mistake suppose must size. That give size sole. Then take strip paper see long piece takes go round thickest part foot, cut length. That sufficient measurement doll's shoe, even fit exactly, she will not mind either pinched little walk little loose." Willie got go Hector told him; Hector willing part soon, often he anybody talk he went his work. Therefore he said-- "But do not think, Willie, set it, better see I do? It would pity spend labour finding shoemakers known hundreds years, could learn easily letting show you." "Thank you," said Willie, sitting again. "I like much. I sit look you. I know doing. You fastening sole boot." "Yes. Do see it is done?" "I am sure. I do not see yet quite. Of course I see sewing one other. I have often wondered could manage small shoes like mine get hand pull needle through; I see do not use needle, I see sewing outside boot, do not put hand inside all. I cannot get understand it." "You minute. You see how, round edge upper, call it, I sewn strong narrow strip, one edge strip sticks round, inside. To edge sticks I sew sole, drawing threads tight I pare edges smooth, look like one piece, puzzle anybody know done." "I think I understand. But get thread sharp stiff go holes make? I find hard enough sometimes get thread eye needle; though thread ever much smaller yours, I sharpen sharpen often I get through. But yours, though thick, keeps sharp goes holes once--two threads once--one side!" "Ah! I do not sharpen thread; I put point upon it." "Does not mean thing?" "Well, may generally; _I_ do not mean thing it. Look here." "I see!" cried Willie; "there long bit something else, thread, upon it. What it? It looks like hair, thicker, sharp point!" "Cannot guess?" "No; I cannot." "Then I tell you. It bristle hog's back. I do not know shoemaker would without them. Look, here is little bunch them." "That is clever use put to," said Willie. "Do go pluck pigs?" "No; buy shop. We want good many, wear out. They get soft, though do not break right off, double places, will not go through." "How fasten thread?" "Look here," said Hector. He took several strands thread together, drew piece cobbler's wax, took bristle put end cunningly, way Willie could not quite follow; rolled rolled threads his hand his leather apron, till seemed like single dark-coloured cord. "There, see, needle thread one." "And good rubbing much cobbler's wax?" "There several good reasons that. In first place, makes threads one sticking together. Next would worn I drawn many times wax, keeps rubbing wearing it. The wax also protects afterwards, keeps wet rotting it. The waxed thread fills hole better too, much consequence anything, sticks last stitch does not slacken next comes, holds tight that, although leather springy, cannot make slip. The two pieces thus got close together like one piece, see I pare joined edges." I tire reader I recount professional talk followed; although Willie found interesting, began feel he soon able make shoe himself, different thing merely read it--the man's voice ears, work going eyes. But shoemaker cared things besides shoemaking, he happened make remark led following question Willie:-- "Do understand astronomy, Hector?" "No. It is business, see, Willie." "But you have telling much moon, way she keeps turning her face always us--in politest manner, said!" "I got Mr Dick's book. I do not understand it. I do not know she so. I know things business, know little shoemaking, business; I do not understand that." "Whose business astronomy then?" "Well," answered Hector, little puzzled, "I do not see well anybody's business God's, I am sure one else lay hand it." "And what is business, Hector?" asked Willie, half-absent mood. Some readers may perhaps think stupid question, perhaps was; Willie therefore stupid. People sometimes _appear_ stupid things think well manage; think one two things may, contrary, _appear_ clever one two things happen talked about. "What business, Willie? Why, keep people dirt, course." "How?" asked Willie again. "By making mending shoes. Mr Dick, now, he goes look stars his telescope, might get his death cold his shoemaker know his business. Of general business, it is part God keeps Himself see stars go right, sun rises sets proper times. For time's two mornings running, see, he might make mistake he was not looked after, would serious. But I told I do not understand astronomy, it is business. I am set keep folk's feet cold wet earth, stones broken glass; however much man may astronomer look sky, he must touch earth part him, generally his feet." "And God sets it, Hector?" "Yes. It is way He looks people's feet. He is got look everything, know, everything would go wrong. So He gives leather tools hands--and I must say head, wants little head make _good_ shoe measure--and He said me--'There! make shoes, I keep stars right.' Is not fine thing hand general business?" And Hector looked shining eyes face little boy, he pulled his rosin-ends he would make boot strong enough keep evil spirits. "I think it is fine thing make nice new shoes," said Willie; "but I do not think I like mend soppy muddy shape." "If would take share general business, must not particular. It will not business, say: part, I would say _below_ business. There is boots corner now. They belong papa. And come next. Do not think it is honour keep feet good man dry warm he goes morning night comforting people? Do not think it is honour mend boots _him_, even dirty?" "Oh, yes--for _papa_!" said Willie, his papa must exception rule. "Well," resumed Hector, "look great lace-boots. I shall fill soles full hobnails presently. They belong best ploughman parish--John Turnbull. Do not think it is honour mend boots man makes best bed corn die in?" "I thought grow in," said Willie. "All same," returned Hector. "When dies grows--and till then, read New Testament. Is not honour, I say, mend boots John Turnbull?" "Oh, yes--for John Turnbull! I know John," said Willie, made difference his merit whether Willie knew not! "And there," Hector went on, "lies pair slippers want patching. They belong William Webster, weaver, round corner. They are much heel too. But is not honour patch set slippers man keeps his neighbours fine linen days lives?" "Yes, yes. I know William. It must nice anything William Webster." "Suppose did not know him, would make difference?" "No," said Willie, thinking little. "Other people would know I did not." "Yes, nobody knew him, God would know him; anybody God thought worth making, it is honour anything for. Believe me, Willie, keep people's feet dry warm important appointment." "Your shoes are not good, Hector," said Willie, casting glances time time his companion's feet, shod manner that, say least it, would prejudiced one favour his handiwork. "Is not honour make shoes Hector?" "There cannot much honour anything yourself," replied Hector, "so far I see. I confess shoes hardly decent, I make pair time; indeed I have thinking I would last three months, soon slack time came; I have far busy yet, and, I do not go much till it is dusk, nobody sees them." "But get feet wet, catch cold?" "Ah! might death me!" said Hector. "I really must make pair. Well now--let see--as soon I mended two pairs--I to-morrow--I begin. And I will tell what," he added, thoughtful pause, "if you will come day to-morrow, I take skin, cut pair shoes myself, shall see I it, everything making them;--yes, shall part yourself, shall first lesson shoemaking." "But Dolly's shoes!" suggested Willie. "Dolly wait bit. She will not take _her_ death cold wet feet. And let tell harder make small pair well large pair. You Dolly's ever much better know make pair me." CHAPTER VI. HOW WILLIE LEARNED TO READ BEFORE HE KNEW HIS LETTERS. The next day his thoughts, nothing particular engage them, kept brooding two things. These two things came together once, resolution consequence. I shall soon explain I mean. The one thing was, Hector shown considerable surprise he found Willie could read. Now Willie least ashamed he could read: he be? It nowhere written catechism he learnt his duty able read; catechism merely forgotten mention it, his father mother would told him. Neither duty he ought known himself--for he would known it. So he ashamed? People often ashamed need ashamed of. Again, often ashamed ought ashamed of, turn faces sun ought hide dust. If, instance, Willie ever put sulky face his mother asked hold baby her, would thing shame skin his face might well try burn off; able read he even made think it, thing ashamed of: would shame ashamed. Now put his head, however, think good thing reading was, would apply longer. It different thing now. The subject occupied his thoughts this: Everybody kind him--so ready things him--and, far consequence, teach himself; he, far he could think, nothing anybody! That could right; _could_ be--for reasonable. Not mention his father mother, Mrs Wilson, taught knit, even given lessons spinning, though come much; Hector Macallaster going teach make shoes; one thing he could think he capable return! This must looked into, things could allowed go like that. All struck Hector said, regret his voice, though he plenty time think, he little time read; also although he could see well enough candlelight work his trade, he could see well enough read. What fine thing would learn read Hector! It would fun surprise too, reading something! The sun his full height Willie received illumination. Before sun went he knew could read sight least dozen words. For moment he saw he ought learn read, he ran his mother, asked her teach him. She delighted, she begun little doubtful whether his father's plan leaving alone till he wanted learn right one. But precise moment she busy something must done his father lay begin teaching his letters. Willie eager learn, however, he could rest without something towards it. He bethought little--then ran got Dr Watts's hymns children. He knew "How doth little busy bee" well able repeat without mistake, his mother taught him, he understood it. You see, he like child five, taught repeat rote lines could give notions mistaken ones. Besides, he good knowledge words, could use well talk, although he could read; great thing child talk well he begins learn read. He opened little book Busy Bee, knowing already enough able divide words one other, he said himself-- "The first word must _How_. There is, gap next word. I look see I find another _How_ anywhere." He looked long time he found one; capital H way. Of course good many _how's_, many big H, he did not know little _h_ good mere word. Then he looked _doth_, he found several _doth's_. Of _the's_ he found great swarm bees little song concerned. _Busy_ scarce; I sure whether he found all; he looked he pretty sure he know he saw it. After he gone way every word first verse, he tried himself, putting his finger random upon it, seeing whether he could tell word happened touch. Sometimes he could, sometimes he could not. However, I said, day over, he knew least dozen words perfectly well sight. Nor let one think great step direction reading. It would easy Willie afterwards break words letters. It took two days more--for part he learning make shoes--to learn know anywhere every word he found hymn. Next he took hymn he learned, applied his mother he came word he know, often. As soon she told one, he hunted he found another another specimen same, went he fixed quite his mind. At length he began compare words like other, discovering wherein looked same, wherein looked different, he learned something sound letters. For instance, comparing _the_ _these_, although one sound two letters, _t_ _h_, puzzled him, likewise silent _e_, he conjectured _s_ must stand hissing sound; he looked words sound, perceived _s_ every one them, he sure it. His mother idea fast he learning; fortnight he begun, she able take hand, she found, her astonishment, he could read great many words, that, she wished spell one, he least notion she meant. "Is not _b_?" she said, wishing help find certain word himself. "I do not know," answered Willie. "It is busy bee," he added, laughing;--"I know him. It must lazy one, I suppose." "Do not know letters?" asked his mother. "No, mamma. Which they? Are rest papa's?" "Oh, silly dear!" she said. "Of course I am!" he returned;--"very silly! How could mine I know names them! When I know all, they will mine, I suppose--and everybody else's knows them.--So that is Mr B--is it?" "Yes. And that is C," said his mother. "I am glad see you, Mr C," said Willie, merrily, nodding letter. "We shall know meet again.--I suppose D, mamma. How d'e do, Mr D? And what is one mouth open, half tongue cut off?" His mother told E. "Then one, foot stand on, Fe, I suppose." His mother laughed; whoever gave name has, would done better call Fe, Willie did. It would much better also, teaching children, least, call H, He, W, We, Y, Ye, Z, Ze, Willie called them. But easy enough learn names he knew much could _do_. What gave considerable advantage was, he begun verse, dry syllables stupid sentences. The music verse repaid trouble making out--even he got meaning, necessity making line go right, rhymes too, helped occasionally pronunciation word. The farther he got on, faster he got on; six weeks over, he could read anything he able understand pretty well sight. By time, also, he understood particulars shoe made, indeed done stitches himself, good deal hammering leather hob-nails, little patching, last smallness his hands advantage. At length, one day, he said shoemaker-- "Shall I read little poem you, Hector?" "You told could not read, Willie." "I though." "Do then," said Hector. Looking small result short time, he considerably astonished find well boy could read; he merely gave words correctly, sentences, far difficult; is, he read Hector could understand writer meant. It great thing read well. Few can. Whoever reads aloud read well, sort deceiver; he pretends introduce one person another, he misrepresents him. In life, Willie continued pay good deal attention merely reading sake, reading sake people, is, reading aloud. As often he came, course his reading, verse he liked much, he always read aloud order teach ought read; his best--first, make sound true, is, read according sense; next, make sound beautiful, is, read according measure verse melody words. He read great deal Hector. There came certain time every day Willie Macmichael joyfully expected shoemaker--to read hour half--beyond time his father wish reading extend. CHAPTER VII. SOME THINGS THAT CAME OF WILLIE'S GOING TO SCHOOL. When his father found he learned read, he judged good go school. Willie much pleased. His mother said she would make bag carry his books in; Willie said occasion trouble herself; for, she would give stuff, he would make it. So she got nice bit green baize, afternoon he made his bag--no gobble-stitch work, good, honest back-stitching, except string-case, run, might draw easier tighter. He passed string bodkin, fixed middle, tied two ends, carried bag his mother, pronounced nearly well made she done herself. At school he found plain good thing have not find every thing beginning; people gather books went learned, come property, were; and, taught them, begin discoveries leave off. In geography, instance, number voyages journeys made, books record written; number books read, facts gathered them, single map could drawn, say geography book printed! Whereas he could learn multitude things various countries, peoples animals plants, mountains rivers lakes cities, without set his foot beyond parish he born. And everything else kind. But Willie learned he learned know I treat. When he went school, his father made present pocket-knife. He one before, good one; this, three blades, sharp, he found wonderful treasure recourse. His father also bought nice new slate. Now another handy boy school, couple years older Willie, whose father carpenter. He cut frame his slate, his initials only, his whole name address,--_Alexander Spelman, Priory Leas_. Willie thought nice would his new knife also cut his name his slate; he would rather make difference way it. What if, instead sinking letters frame, he made stand frame cutting away depth round them. There much originality this, reversing Spelman done; difficult, would, he thought, prettier. Then he thus carve? One would say, "Why, _William Macmichael_, course, and, he liked, _Priory Leas_" But Willie peculiar little fellow, began reason whether he right put his name slate. "My father give slate," he said, "to own. He gave knife like that, slate. When I grown up, belong Agnes. What shall I put it? What is mine's papa's, what is papa's his own," argued Willie.--"_I_ know!" he said last. The boys could not imagine he meant saw draw first D O frame. But saw C T follow, thought conceited little prig Willie was! "Do think you are doctor father is, little ape?" said. "No, no," answered Willie, laughing heartily, thinking, he went his work, he might one day. When drawing letters finished, stood, round slate, "_Doctor Macmichael's Willie, The Ruins, Priory Leas_." Then came his knife. But long job, Willie one slovenly boys _scamp_ work. Such boys nothing soft, pulpy creatures, who, grow men, soft hard work world. They fit buffers, keep working men breaking heads eagerness. But carving length finished, gave much satisfaction--first Willie himself, finished; next, Alexander Spelman, Priory Leas, because, generous-minded boy, he admired Willie's new superior work; third, Mr Mrs Macmichael, saw it, boy's faculty merely, his love his father well; recognition right us one sweetest forms love take. "_I yours_" best greatest thing one say, right person. It led strong friendship Spelman, his going often workshop elder Spelman, carpenter. He solemn, long-faced, long-legged man, reddish hair pale complexion, seldom ever smiled, bench always looked he standing stool, he stooped immoderately. A greater contrast shoemaker could hardly found, except this, carpenter also looked sickly. He perfect health, however, oppressed cares his family, sickness his wife, constant invalid, children her husband thought she could well manage, he well provide for. But he thought less he would got better. He worked hard, little fancied many fewer strokes his plane he made hour he brooding his difficulties, imagining would consequences misfortune befall him--of he sought secured shadow beforehand, darken hinder labour might prevent arrival. But he good man nevertheless, his greatest bugbear debt. If he could pay every penny he owed world, his wife far better enjoy life little, he would, he thought, perfectly happy. His wife, however, tolerably happy, notwithstanding her weak health, certainly enjoyed life good deal--far least her husband able believe. Mr Macmichael kind attentive Mrs Spelman; though, carpenter said, he had not seen colour _his_ money years. But Doctor knew Spelman hard-working man, would rather given little money pressed penny. He told one day, he lamenting he could not pay even _yet_, he glad anything least little bit like Saviour he world--"a carpenter like you, Spelman--think that," added Doctor. So Spelman full gratitude he could hold. Except Hector Macallaster, Doctor almost his creditor. Medicine shoes his chief trials: he kept paying latter, debt former went accumulating. Hence came Willie began haunt his shop, though he hardly single smile give little fellow, he pleased;--gave odds ends wood; lent whatever tools he wanted except adze--that he would let touch; would drop hint use them; would moment stop his work attend difficulty boy found in; and, short, paid far attention he would thought required Willie his apprentice. From moment he entered workshop, Willie could hardly keep his hands tools. The shape them, lay bench hung wall, seemed say over, "Come, use me; come, use me." They looked waiting, hungry work. They wanted stuff shape fashion things, join things. They wanted make bigger tools themselves--for ploughing earth, carrying harvest, one ten thousand services rendered house fields. It impossible Willie see hollow lip gouge, straight lip chisel, lip fitted another lip, made mouth plane, worm-like auger, critical spokeshave, hammer so, humble bradawl pioneer--he could see none without longing send his life theirs, set world--for dumb looks seemed ever implore? At time young Spelman busy making salt-box his mother sound bits old oak floor his father taken dry-rotted. It hard wood work, Willie bore hand planing pieces, initiated mysteries dovetailing gluing. Before lid put hinges, he carved initials carpenter his wife relief upon it, many years used show his work. But first thing he set making water-wheel. If he seaside boy, his first job would boat; he lived flat country, would likely windmill; noticeable thing neighbourhood mill grinding corn driven water-wheel. When Willie tiny boy, he gone Farmer Thomson's man load corn see mill; miller taken it. He saw corn go hopper trough real hopper, kept constantly hopping shake corn hole middle upper stone, went round round lower, ground corn meal, which, story beneath, he saw pouring, solid stream like avalanche, wooden spout. But best wheel outside, busy rush water made go. So Willie would make water-wheel. The carpenter given short lecture different kinds water-wheels, he decided undershot, Sandy's help proceeded construct it--with nave mahogany, spokes birch, floats deal, axle stout iron-wire, which, friction would great, run gudgeon-blocks hard wood, well oiled. These blocks fixed frame devised that, help stones support it, wheel might set going small stream. There many tiny brooks running river, fixed upon one issued rising ground back village: began run merrily hill, constructed channel stonebed water-wheel--not means go sleep in! It went delightfully, shall hear by. For present, I confess that, days, Willie got tired it--and small blame him, earthly use beyond amusement, amuse never amuse long. I think reason children get tired toys soon human nature really interested use. If say beautiful thing always interesting, I answer, beautiful thing highest use. Is diamond flashes colours heart poet useful diamond glazier divides sheets glass panes windows? Anyhow, reason Willie got tired his water-wheel went round round, nothing go round. It drove machinery, ground grain corn--"did nothing _no_body," Willie said, seeking emphatic. So he carried home, put away certain part ruins he kept odds ends things might day come useful. Mr Macmichael devoted his profession he desired nothing better Willie he medical man, he pleased find well Willie's hands able carry his contrivances; he judged impossible country doctor much mechanical faculty. The exercise skill alone might secure instant relief patient, saving him. But, this, he believed nothing tended much develop common sense--the precious faculties--as things hands. Hence he encouraged Willie everything he undertook, but, considering five hours school quite sufficient study sort, requested master give lessons home. So Willie worked hard school, plenty time spend carpentering, he soon came use common bench-tools ease, Spelman proud his apprentice, he called him--so much so, burden his debt grew much lighter upon his shoulders. But Willie forget his older friend, Hector Macallaster. Every half-holiday he read couple hours, chiefly, time, Dick's Astronomy. Neither understood he read, understood much, Hector could explain things puzzled Willie. And he found everything went order, him, he began see even thing well done worth good deal done right moment within set time; heavens like great clock, ordering time everything. Neither he give shoemaking, he often little work Hector, made leather apron, cut bits stout leather protect his hands thread he sewing. For twelve months, however, his chief employment lay workshop carpenter. CHAPTER VIII. WILLIE DIGS AND FINDS WHAT HE DID NOT EXPECT. He reading Hector Sir Walter Scott's "Antiquary," occurs narration digging treasure ruins unlike these, grander. It little consequence Willie treasure found there: propriety digging remained same; certain spot he often fancied hollow sound, he stamped hard, indicated empty place underneath. I believe came above, beneath; although portion vaulted roof little chamber broken in, greater part still remained, might caused reverberation. The floor heaped fallen stones rubbish. One Wednesday afternoon, instead going Hector, he told expect him, he got pickaxe spade, proceeded dig trodden heap. At first blow pickaxe he came upon large stones--the job clearing means easy one--so far it, indeed, that, working half hour, getting two large half dozen smaller ones, he resolved ask Sandy Spelman help him. So he left his pickaxe one point fast two stones, ran shop. Sandy work, his father quite willing let go. Willie told he digging treasure, laughed it; time Willie thought himself--"Who knows? People _have_ found treasures buried old places like that. The Antiquary not--but he story, _high story_" (for Willie's derivation word _history_). "The place sounds likely enough. Anyhow, where is harm trying?" They eager--for Sandy liked idea digging ruins much better work he at--that set full speed moment shop, never slackened stood panting anchored pickaxe, upon Spelman pounced, stronger Willie, used hard work, soon dislodged stones held it. They much larger, however, Willie come upon before, roll little chamber, instead lifting them; got better, soon piled good heap wall outside. After tea, set work again, worked till twilight grew dark them--by time got heap seemed original level floor. Still stones below, fatigue darkness, compelled stop, Sandy went home, promising come early he could morning call Willie, leave end string hanging staircase window, whose end pass keyhole his door tied his wrist. He seemed hardly bed hour, he woke his arm full length, pulling going would pull bed. He tugged reply, jumped out. It lovely summer morning--the sun yards sky; grass glittering dew; birds singing singing first would sing last; whole air, even his little room, filled cool odour blessed thoughts, warm enough let know noontide would hot. And Sandy waiting street help dig treasure! In minutes he opened street door admitted him. They went straight scene labour. Having got stones, began fancy heard curious sound, agreed like running water anything else could think of. Now, except well street, cottage, water knew much nearer river, wondered good deal. At length Sandy's pickaxe got hold stone he could move, he would. He tried another, succeeded, soon began suspect masonry there. Contenting therefore clearing loose stones, he soon found plainly enough he working narrow space, around circular wall solid stone lime. The sound running water clear enough, earth hole damp. Sandy got three four feet level. "It is old well," he said. "There doubt it." "Does smell bad?" asked Willie, peeping disappointed. "Not bit," answered Sandy. "Then it is stagnant," said Willie. "You might told ears without troubling nose," said Sandy. "Did not hear running?" "How running it is buried away there?" said Willie. "How make noise is not running?" retorted Sandy--to question Willie attempted reply. It serious work get stones up, Sandy's head level ground; he could lift larger ones hole, Willie saw he must contrive give help. He ran therefore house, brought rope he seen lying about. One end Sandy tied round whatever stone heavy him, Willie, laying hold other, lifted along him. They got faster now, minutes Sandy exclaimed-- "Here last!" "The treasure?" cried Willie. "Oh, jolly!" Sandy burst laughing, shouted-- "The water!" "Bother water!" growled Willie. "But go on, Sandy; iron chest may bottom water, know." "All well there!" retorted Sandy. "But though I get stones out, I cannot get water out. And I have notion diving there is pretty sure nothing dive for. Besides, body cannot dive stone pipe like this. I want weights sink me, I might not get time. I want breakfast dreadful, Willie." So saying, he scrambled side well, last appeared, his boots, namely, bore testimony enough his reached water. Willie peered well, caught dull glimmer stones; then, good deal disappointed, followed Sandy he strode away towards house. "You will come breakfast me, Sandy, will not you?" he said behind him. "No, thank you," answered Sandy. "I do not like porridge mother's." And without looking behind him, he walked right cottage, away home. Before Willie finished his porridge, he got his disappointment, even begun see he never really expected find treasure. Only would fun hand his father! All morning school, however, his thoughts would go back little vault, cool shadowy, sheltering ancient well light lorded country outside. No doubt streams rejoiced it, even would much evening came cool console them; slow wells marshy ground mountains must feel faint hour burning eye. This well always been, always would be, cool blessed sweet, like--like precious thing think about. And was not nice thing well own? Tibby need not go village pump--which certainly nearer, stood street, ground. Of course, yet, she could draw bucketful, water hardly came stones; he would soon get many would make deep enough--only, Sandy could get big ones, his help too, he manage alone? There rub! I must go back little explain he came think plan. After Hector he gone far Dr Dick's astronomy could understand, found getting seemed quite jungle planets, suns, comets, constellations. "It seems me," said shoemaker, "that understand anything must understand everything." So laid book aside present; Hector, searching another fill remainder afternoon, came upon one mechanical powers treated simple fashion. Of book Willie read good deal. I cannot say he yet come understand mechanical power thoroughly see lever wheel-and-axle kind, screw, inclined plane, wedge power different shapes; he understand single pulley gives advantage except enabling apply strength effective manner, second pulley takes half weight you. Hence, difficulty he found himself, came thought block pulley it, he seen lying carpenter's shop. He remembered also great iron staple _eye_ vault well; he could get hold second pulley, thing good done--the well good cleared whatever depth he could reach water. As soon school over, he ran Mr Spelman, found his delight he could lend pulley another well. Each ran block iron hook attached it. With aid ladder he put hook one blocks staple, fastened end his rope block. Next he got another bit rope, pulled his shoes stockings, got well, tied round largest stone within reach, loosely enough allow hook second pulley lay hold it. Then, sailor would say, he rove end long rope block, getting ladder again, rove also first block he left hanging staple. All preparations thus completed, he stood well, hauled away rope. It came slipping pulleys, rose stone well magic. As soon came clear edge, he drew towards him, lowered ground, took rope collar, rolled doorway. Then he got well again, tied collar another stone, drew pulley, thrust hook collar, got well, hauled second stone. In way he soon got many he standing far his ankles water, cold he glad get pull every stone. By time perfectly explained water made noise, he saw escape opening side well. He came last huge stone, round difficulty he managed fasten rope. He pull away smaller stones beneath it, pass rope it. Having lifted little way powerful help his tackle, try right he got haul earnest, he saw his knot slipping, lowered stone set one end, leaning side well--when he discovered his rope collar got frayed, one strands cut through; would probably break let stone fall well, he would still probably tumble it. He getting tired too, growing dusky ruins. He thought better postpone proceedings, getting well, caught his shoes stockings, went house. CHAPTER IX. A MARVEL. Early next morning Mr Macmichael, he dressing, heard laugh strange delight garden, and, drawing blind, looked out. There, distance off, stood Willie, one moment staring motionless something his feet, dancing skipping singing, still looking something his feet. His father could see something was, Willie side one mounds, turning away finish his dressing, another direction peculiar glitter caught his eye. "What mean?" he said himself. "Water garden! There is rain; there is neither river reservoir overflow! I hardly believe eyes!" He hurried remainder his clothes, went out. But he gone many steps he meet merry little brook coming cantering two mounds! It already worn channel path. He followed up, wondering much, bewildered indeed; got little turfy hollow, middle came bubbling gabbling along, Willie caught sight him, bounded meet radiant countenance almost inarticulate cries delight. "Am I awake, Willie? I dreaming?" he asked. "Wide awake, papa," answered Willie. "Then meaning this? _You_ seem secret: water come from? I feel I fairy tale." "Is not lovely?" cried Willie. "I will show comes from. This way. You will spoil boots there. Look rhubarb-bed; it is turned swamp." "The garden ruined," said his father. "No, no, papa; will not let come that. I have watching it. There is soil carried away yet. Do come see." In mute astonishment, his father followed. As I already described it, ground uneven, many heights hollows, whence came water took amazing number twists turns. Willie led his father straight he could, I do not know often crossed little brook came where, old stone shaft, like crater volcano, rolled brim, eruption cool, clear, lucid water. Plenteous rose overflowed, like dark yet clear molten gem, tumbling open world. How deliciously wet looked shadow I---how caught sun moment left chamber, grew merry, trotted trolled cantered along! "Is _your_ work, Willie?" asked his father, know twenty questions ask first. "Mostly," said Willie. "You little wizard! about? I cannot understand it. We must make drain once." "Bury beauty like drain!" cried Willie. "O papa!" "Well, I do not know else it. How never found way before--somewhere other?" "I will soon show that," said Willie. "I will soon send business." He thought, he first saw issuing water, weight fallen stones hard covering earth removed, spring burst tenfold volume vigour; satisfied thinking it, overflow must great stone he set leaning side last thing dropping work previous night: must blocked opening, prevented water getting fast before, is, fast spring rose. Therefore he laid hold rope, still connected stone, and, aware water would help partly floating it, astonished find easily he moved it. At swung away side middle well; water ceased run edge, loud gurgling began sink, sank opening escaped visible. "Ah! now, I understand!" cried Mr Macmichael. "It is old well Priory you have come upon, little burrowing mole." "Sandy helped stones. I thought might treasure there, set digging. It funny treasure find--was not it? No treasure could prettier though." "If Prior's Well, true said old times," returned his father, "it may turn greater treasure even hoped for, Willie. Why, I found time ago old book monasteries country, people used come great distances drink water Prior's Well, believing cure every disease sun. Run house fetch jug." "Yes, papa," said Willie, bounded off. There little brook careering garden now--only pools there--and channel would soon dry hot sun. But Willie thought delightful able one whenever he pleased. And might much bigger brook too, for, instead using stone could partly block water underground way, he would cut piece wood large enough cover opening, rounded little fit side well; he would put big stone far opening piece wood could get side well, held tight. Then water would forced mount up, get top, run garden. Meantime Mr Macmichael, gone see course water taken, left garden, found that, circuitous route, run hedge surface drain field, hill towards river. When Willie brought jug, he filled well, carried water his surgery. There he put little several different glasses, dropping something one bottle one glass, something another bottle another glass, soon satisfied contained medicinal salts considerable quantities. There could doubt Willie found Prior's Well. "It is good thing," said his father breakfast, "that did not flood house, Willie! One turn stream would back-door." "It would not done much harm," said Willie. "It would run along slabs passage again, front door lower back. It would fun!" "You mischievous little thing!" said his mother, pretending scold him,--"you do not think trouble would given Tibby!" "But would not fun? And would not lovely--running house hot summer day?" "There may difference opinion that, Master Willie," said his mother. "You, instance, might like walk water every time went parlour kitchen, I cannot say I should." Curious know whether village pump might supplied his well, Mr Macmichael next analysed water also, satisfied connection them. Within next fortnight Willie discovered often stream ran garden, little brook he set his water-wheel going nearly dry. He soon made nice little channel it, get beds. He laid turf along banks parts, sowed grass daisy-seed others; he found pretty stone she will, bit coloured glass bright crockery broken mirror, he would always throw in, water might prettier path run upon. Indeed, he emptied his store marbles it. He particularly fond playing marbles, he great fancy real white marble lovely red streaks, collected twenty thirty them. He kept brook now, instead calico bag. The summer hot dry one. More rest gardens village, The Ruins suffered weather; deep gravel-bed mould, good part produce grew mounds, mostly heaps stones, neither gravel stones could retain much moisture. Willie watered good deal Prior's Well; hard work, seem much use. One evening, he set little brook free run garden, sun setting huge red, promise another glowing day to-morrow, air stifling, breath wind stirring, flowers hung heads oppressed, leaves little buttons fruit trees looked ready shrivel drop boughs, thought came whether he could turn brook little Nile, causing overflow banks enrich garden. He could not, course, bring way; Nile overflows quantities rain far-off mountains, making huge torrents rush faster channel, slow, level country, carry water away, nothing overflow. If, however, he could make water run well, he could make difficult come get away. First, he stopped outlet hedge stones, clay, bits board; watched spread, he saw would try escape next, same; on, taking care especially keep house. The mounds great assistance hemming in, he hard enough work notwithstanding; soon perceived one spot would get better minutes, make straight back-door. He ran opened sluice well, away stream gurgled underground. Before morning water left disappeared. It soaked mounds, gravel, comforting hot roots went, feeding dissolved minerals. Doubtless, also, lay night many little hidden pool, heat next day's sun drew up, comforting again, roots earth, leaves air, sky. Willie could help thinking garden looked refreshed; green brighter, he thought, flowers held heads little better; carrots looked feathery, ferns palmy; everything looked, he said, he felt good drink Prior's Well. At events, he resolved every night sunset hot weather lasted--that was, his father objection. Mr Macmichael said he might try it, he must mind go bed leave water running, else would cartload mud house morning. So Willie strengthened heightened his barriers, built huge one last point water tried get away, soon sun shut sluice, watched water surged throat well, rushed caught toils he made it. Before could find fresh place get at, whole upper part garden one network lakes islands. Willie kept walking round round it, wild beast trying get cage, he watch prevent every weak spot; he magician, busily sustaining charm he confined gad-about creature. The moment he saw beginning get better him, he ran sluice banished regions below. Then he fetched old newspaper, sitting borders his lake, fashioned boat boat paper, sent sailing like merchant ships isle blooming isle. Night night he flooded garden, always morning water sunk away gravel. Soon longer doubt everything mightily refreshed it; look exhaustion hopelessness gone, life busy flower tree plant. This year garden, even banks river, compare it; autumn came, fruit Mr Macmichael remembered ever seen before. CHAPTER X. A NEW ALARUM. Willie always thinking uses he could put things to. Only he never tempted set fine thing dirty work, dull-hearted money-grubbers do--mill-owners, instance, make channel lovely mountain-stream serve drain carry filth works. If Dante known such, I know he would put them, I would rather describe place. I told Willie made prisoned stream garden; I tell he made running stream himself, shall judge whether fit work require it. Ever since he ceased night-nurse little Agnes, he wished he one wake every night, middle it, he might get look window. For, he fed his baby-sister given her back his mother state contentment, getting bed he always looked window see night like--not he one bit anxious weather, except, indeed, he heard his papa getting go out, knew he go; he could enjoy weather sort sorts, never thought next day would like--but see Madame Night thinking about--how she looked, she doing. For he soon found her changeful creature that, every time he looked her, she looked another face she worn last time. Before he made acquaintance night, he would often, ere he fell asleep, lie wondering he going dream about; for, his practical tendencies, Willie fond dreaming; he begun manner make acquaintance her, he would often fall asleep wondering day would dreaming about--for, his fanciful way thinking, he settled look night day dreaming. Hence, Agnes required his services longer, he fell asleep first night full intention waking before, getting peep day's dream, whatever might be, night, every night thereafter. But he back his room, nothing wake him, he slept sound day done dreaming, morning wide awake. Neither he awoke one night since, seen marvel might beyond his windowpanes. Does little boy girl wonder going asleep? Sometimes stars, sometimes moon, sometimes clouds, sometimes wind, sometimes snow, sometimes frost, sometimes together, busy. Sometimes owl moth beetle, bat cat rat, work. Sometimes flowers bloom love night better day, busy darkness pouring still air scent withheld sunlight. Sometimes lightning thunder, sometimes moon-rainbow, sometimes aurora borealis, busy. And streams running night long, seem babble louder day time, noises working world still, hear better. Almost daylight thing awake, clock ticking nobody heed it, sounds dismal. But look night, meaning her face Willie cared about, desired much see, he times quite unhappy think he never could wake up, although ever many strange lovely dreams might passing his window. He often dreamed he waked up, looking gorgeous lovely show, morning he knew sorrowfully he dreamed his dream, gazed sleeping day. Again he worked his brains weariness, trying trying invent machine wake him. But although he older cleverer now, he fared better he wanted wake help his mother Agnes. He must motive power he could anything, clock still power he could think of, he afraid meddle with, works beyond him, essential well-being house he would venture putting jeopardy. One day, however, he thinking nothing it, struck he another motive power his command, thought hardly entered his mind, he saw also possible turn account. His motive power stream Prior's Well, means using his purpose stood shelf ruins, shape toy water-wheel he laid aside distressingly useless. He set thing once. First all, he made second bit channel stream, like little loop first, he could, he pleased, turn part water it, let join principal channel little lower down. This was, fact, his mill-race. Just joined older part again, right opposite his window, he made run little way direct line towards house, part new channel he made preparations his water-wheel. Into channel he laid piece iron pipe, lying useless years; water would issue concentrated rush lower end it, he constructed foundation his wheel, similar Sandy he built before. The water, issued pipe, strike straight upon floats, send whirling round. It took time build it, he wanted good permanent job. He stones command: he well, he said, yielded stones water, everybody could say; order make sound bit work, he fetched lump quick-lime kiln, burned quantities scatter clay-soil, first wetting water till fell powder, mixing sand he riddled gravel he dug garden, he made good strong mortar. When bed length made it, he took wheel put longer axis, project one side beyond gudgeon-block, hollow turned; upon projecting piece he fixed large reel. Then, put wheel place, he asked his father sixpence, part he laid large ball pack-thread. The outside end ball he fastened reel, threw ball open window his room, undid inside end, laying thread coils floor. When time go bed, he ran turned water first garden, new channel; suddenly wheel began spin about, wind pack-thread reel. He ran his room, undressed faster he ever done before, tied end thread around his wrist, and, although kept awake much longer usual his excitement, length fell fast asleep, dreamed thread waked him, drawn window, he saw water-wheel flashing like fire-wheel, water rushing away green flame. When he wake broad day; coils pack-thread lying floor scarcely diminished; brook singing garden, he went window, he saw wheel spinning merrily round. He dressed haste, ran out, found thread got entangled amongst bushes way wheel, stuck fast; whereupon wheel broken get loose, spinning round round night nothing, like useless thing before. That afternoon he set poles guides, along top thread might run, keep clear bushes. But he fared better next night, he never waked morning, he found wheel stood stock still, thread, filled reel, slipped off, wound wheel choked many windings. Indeed, thread wonderful tangle whole machine, took long time unwind--turning wheel backwards, break thread. In order remove fresh failure, he went turner, whose name William Burt, asked turn large reel spool, deep ends, small cylinder between. William told he busy then, he would fix suitable piece wood his old lathe, which, he knew handy boy, he might turn he wanted himself. This his first attempt use turning-lathe; he often watched William work, familiar way he held his tool. Hence result tolerably satisfactory. Long he reached depth he wished make spool, he learned manage his chisel nicety. Burt finished touches; and, delighted his acquisition rudiments new trade, he carried spool home him, try possibility educating his water-wheel watchman. That night pull indeed come, but, alas he even fallen asleep. Something seemed always going wrong! He concluded already difficult thing make machine maker wished. The spool gone flying round, swallowed thread incredibly fast. He made haste get end his wrist, saw fly little hole window frame, away rest it, wound whirling spool. Disappointing was, however, progress it: he got thing work, remained regulate it. But turned difficult part affair far. He saw he make thread longer, first mode suggested itself, he would increase constant danger getting fouled, mention awkwardness using quantity it. If kitten get room, instance, he laid down, she would ruin his every hope time being; Willie's eyes sixpence huge sum ask his father. But if, contrary, he could find mode making machine wind slowly, he might able shorten instead lengthening string. At length, much pondering, he came see if, instead spool, he fix axis small cogged wheel--that is, wheel teeth--and make cogs fit cogs much larger wheel, small wheel, would turn every turn water-wheel, must turn great many times could turn big wheel once. Then he must fix spool axis great slow wheel, when, turning often wheel turned, spool would wind thread much slowly. I weary reader detail Willie's efforts failures. It enough say he last entirely successful timing his machine, run water always same, he could tell exactly much thread would wind given time. Having measured thread mark ink first hour, two second, on, he able set his alarum according time he wished woke pull his wrist. But one happened go garden household asleep, come upon toy water-wheel, working away starlight moonlight, little, even he caught sight nearly invisible thread, discovered wheel winding up, would he thought tiny machine about! How little would he thought business infinite! connection window eternal world--namely, Willie's soul--from given moment would lift curtains, namely, eyelids, let night outer world upon thought feeling boy! To use likeness, wheel thus ever working draw slide _camera obscura_, let whatever pictures might abroad dreams day, watcher within might behold them. Indeed, one night he came home visiting patient, soon Willie length taught his watchman his duty, Mr Macmichael come upon mill, going turn water well, he thought Willie forgotten do, he caught sight winding thread--for moon full, Doctor sharp-sighted. "What _can_ now?" he said himself. "Some new freak Willie's, course. Yes; thread goes right his window! I dare say I stop watch I see something happen consequence. But I tired, must go bed." Just he thought thus himself, wheel stopped. The next moment blind Willie's window drawn up, stood Willie, his face his white gown glimmering moonlight. He caught sight his father, went sash. "O papa!" he cried; "I did not think I going see!" "Who thought see?" asked his father. "Oh, nobody!--only night herself, moon perhaps." "What new freak this, boy?" said his father, smiling. "Wait minute, I will tell it," answered Willie. Out he came his night-shirt, his bare feet dancing pleasure his father his midnight companion. On grass, beside ruins, moonlight, gurgling water, he told it. "Yes, boy; right," said his father. "God never sleeps; would pity never saw Him his night-work." [Illustration: "ON THE GRASS, BESIDE THE RUINS, IN THE MOONLIGHT, WILLIE TOLD HIS FATHER ALL ABOUT IT."] CHAPTER XI. SOME OF THE SIGHTS WILLIE SAW. I fancy readers would like hear scenes Willie saw occasions. The little mill went night night--almost everynight summer, nights winter frost was not hard would frozen machinery. But attempt describe variety pictures Willie saw would endless labour. Sometimes, he looked out, simple, quiet, thoughtful night met his gaze, without moon, full stars could hold, flashing trembling dew slowly sinking air settle upon earth thousand living things below. On night Willie never went bed without wishing pure heart, he might one day see God whose thought taken shape lovely night. For although he could expressed thus time, he felt must God's thinking put there. Other times, stars would half blotted out--all heavens--not mist, light moon. Oh, lovely she was!--so calm! alone midst great blue ocean! sun night! She seemed hold tent heavens great silver knot. And, like stars above, flowers lost colour looked pale wan, sweet sad. It like schoolmaster telling Elysium Greek Latin poets, fancied good people went died--not half glad bright busy daylight world left behind them, always wanted go back might eat drink merry again--but oh, tender lovely mournfulness! Several times winter, looking out, he saw strange sight--the air full great snowflakes he could see moon them, although her light visible them. They came floating slowly dusky light, precipitate solution moonbeams. He could hardly persuade go bed, fascinating sight; cold would drive his nest again. Once wheel-watchman pulled midst terrible thunder-storm--when East West answering alternate flashes forked lightning seemed split black clouds cracks blinding blue, awful blasting silence--followed great, billowy, shattering rolls thunder, loud sky huge kettledrum, clubs giant drummers beating terrible onset; sudden intervals, came big-dropped rain, pattering earth beaten clouds blows thunder. But Willie frightened, though lightning blinded thunder deafened him--not frightened tiniest flower garden below, which, she could thought it, would thought done she might feel cooler stronger, able hold her head better. And he saw glorious dance aurora borealis--in colours faint rainbow. The frosty snow sparkled underneath, cold stars winter sparkled above, snow stars, shimmered shifted, vanished came again, serried host spears. Willie reading "Paradise Lost," part pleased him, boy-like, most, wars angels sixth book. Hence came aurora looked like crowding innumerable spears--in hands angels, invisible--clashed together shaken asunder, however, convolutions mazy dance victory, rather brandished hurtled tumult battle. Another vision would greatly delight far common one: moon wading clouds blown slowly across sky--especially upper wind, unfelt below. Now she would sinking helpless black faint--growing dim, last she disappeared night--was blotted face nature, leaving dim memorial light behind her; her soul would come her again, she more--doubtful indeed: slow, solemn revival, her light would grow grow, last fringe great cloud swung away her face, she dawned stately glorious, float space queenly triumph across lake clearest blue. And Willie philosopher enough say himself, fainting reviving, defeat conquest, appearances; moon her bright self time, basking contented light her sun, her cloud could creep, her Willie. But delighted catch moon dreaming. That old moon, tumbled her back, would come floating east, like little boat rising tide night, looking lost infinite sea! Dreaming she must surely!--she looked nothing dreaming; she seemed care nothing--not even she old worn, withered dying,--not even that, instead sinking west, deep bed dim repose, she drifting, haggard battered, untidy weak sleepy, dazzling halls sun. Did she know his light would clothe her garment, hide her highest recesses his light-filled ceiling? she dreaming, dreaming--sweet, cool, tender dreams her own, neither knew cared anything around her? What strange look night wore tired old moon thus dreaming time she would come again, back vanishing darkness--a single curved thread baby moon, grow grow great full-grown lady moon, able cross fearless gaze gulf vaulted heavens--alone, neither sleep dreams protect her! There many nights, far commonplace, yet Willie liked well look upon, could keep long his bed. There was, instance, moonless cloudy night, when, he able pierce darkness core, he would found nothing blackness. It power own, one cannot say much look at. On night he would say day sound asleep he dreaming nothing all, make haste his nest. Then cold night black frost, cloud enough hide stars moon, yet little light came soaking through, enough reveal hopeless dreary earth was. For nights cold, snow cover them, flowers crept roots hide winter even able dream spring;--they grow quite stupid benumbed, sleep outright like polar bear dormouse. He never could look long night. Neither he care look long loud wind out--except moon bright; he could distinguish trees blowing sky, always seemed like it, want stop. And big strong trees like it, could poor little delicate flowers, shivering shaking tossed fro? If he could seen wind itself, would different thing; was, he could enjoy lying bed listening it. Then he listened he could fancy floating miles miles night wind, moon-and-star-light, moony snowflakes, even thick darkness rain; until, falling asleep middle his fancy, would thicken around dream delight. Once eclipse moon two of the clock morning. "It is pity it is late, rather early," said Mr Macmichael. "You, Willie, will not able see it." "Oh, yes, I shall, father," answered Willie. "I cannot let sit late. I shall middle Sedgy Moor likely begins--and wake you? I will not mother disturbed, Tibby's much depend upon. She is hard-worked wake she likes, poor old thing." "Oh, I woke without anybody it!" said Willie. "You do not mean depend water-wheel wake right time, you?" "Yes, I do, father. If tell exactly eclipse going begin, I set wakener shall wake quarter-of-an-hour before, I may sure seeing first it." "Well, worth something you, that!" said Mr Macmichael. "It is worth great deal me, already," said Willie. "It would shown eclipse now, has not one since I set going." And wake did. While his father riding across moor, strange hush blotted moon, Willie garden beside his motionless wheel, watching fell shadow earth passing blessed face moon, leaving her pure clear, nothing worse. CHAPTER XII. A NEW SCHEME. I said Willie's father mother used talk without restraint his presence. They fear Willie's committing indiscretion repeating he heard. One day dinner following conversation took place them. "I have letter mother, John," said Mrs Macmichael her husband. "It is wonderful well she manages write, she sees badly." "She might see well enough--at least great deal better--if she would submit operation, said doctor. "At _her_ age, John!" returned his wife expostulatory tone. "Do really think worth while--for years left her?" "Worth see well years!" exclaimed doctor. "Indeed, I do." "But there is another thing I want talk now," said Mrs Macmichael. "Since old Ann's death, six months ago, she says she miserable, she goes like this, shorten days left her. Effie, endurable servant she since Ann, going leave end her half-year, she says thought another makes her wretched. She may little hard please, used one many years, wonder she particular. I do not know done." "I do not know, either--except make her present Tibby," said her husband. "John!" exclaimed Mrs Macmichael; "John" burst laughing. "You do not think they would pull together?" he said. "Two old people--each her ways, without memories common bind together! I am surprised dreaming thing," exclaimed his wife. "But I did not even dream it; I said it," returned her husband. "It is time knew I joking, wifie." "You joke dreadfully like earnest!" she answered. "If one room house!" said doctor, thoughtfully. "Ah!" returned his wife, eagerly, "that would blessing! And though Tibby would thorn every inch grandmamma's body, alone together, I doubt would get well them." "I do not doubt it," said her husband, still thoughtfully. "Could not manage somehow, John?" said Mrs Macmichael, half timidly, pause duration. "I cannot say I see how--at moment," answered doctor, "much I like it. But there is time yet, we will think over, talk it, perhaps may hit upon plan other. Most things _may_ done; everything necessary _can_ done _some_how. So will not bother minds it, brains, see us." With he rose went his laboratory. Willie rose also went straight his room. Having looked round thoughtfully several times, he went landing, whence ladder led garret running whole length roof cottage. "My room would grannie," he said himself; "and I could sleep there. A shake-down corner would well enough me." He climbed ladder, pushed open trap-door, crept half through, surveyed gloomy place. "There is window skylight!" he said; his eyes smarted tears rush them. "What _shall_ I do? Wheelie useless!--Well, I cannot help it; I cannot help it, I bear it. To grannie comfortable better look window ever much." He drew his head, came ladder rush, hurried school. At supper he laid his scheme his father mother. They looked much pleased boy. But his father said once-- "No, no, Willie. It will not do. I am glad you have first think something--only, unfortunately, plan will not work. You cannot sleep there." "I will engage sleep wherever there is room lie down; is not I will engage sleep sitting standing," said Willie, whose mother often said she wished she could sleep like Willie. "And I do not walk sleep," he added, "the trap-door need not shut." "Mice, Willie!" said his mother, tone much significance. "The cat I good friends," returned Willie. "She will pleased enough sleep me." "You do not hit thing all," said his father. "I wonder practical man like you, Willie, does not see once. Even I expense ceiling whole roof lath plaster, find you, morning summer, baked black coal; else, morning winter frozen stiff that, tried lift you, arm snapped like dry twig elder." "Ho! ho! ho!" laughed Willie; "then would room grannie." His father laughed him, his mother looked little shocked. "No, Willie," said his father again; "you must make another attempt. You must say Hamlet he puzzled plan--'About brains!' Perhaps suggest something wiser next time." Willie lay long awake night, thinking, _Wheelie_ pulled he wink sleep. He got up, course, looked window. The day dreaming grandly. The sky pretty clear front, full sparkles light, stars kept background moon, little towards west. She sunk top huge towering cloud, edges whose jags pinnacles she bordered line silvery light. Now cloud rose sky behind ruins, looking good deal like upheaved towers spires, made Willie think within grand place priory must been, roofs turrets rose sky. "They say lot people lived then!" he thought he stood gazing cloud. Suddenly he gave great jump, clapped his hands loud he woke his father. "Is anything matter, boy?" he asked, opening Willie's door, peeping in. "No, papa, nothing," answered Willie. "Only something came head great bounce!" "Ah!--Where come from, Willie?" "Out cloud there. Is not grand one?" "Grand enough certainly put many thoughts body's head, Willie. What put yours?" "Please, I would rather tell yet," answered Willie, "--if do not mind, father." "Not bit, boy. Tell please, do not tell all. I like hear it, pleasure, Willie." "Thank you, father. I want tell you, know, yet." "Very well, boy. Now go bed, sleep may better thought morning." Willie soon fell asleep now, he believed he found he wanted. He earlier usual next morning, garden. "Surely," he said himself, "those ruins, held many monks, might manage even yet find room me!" He went wandering amongst them, like undecided young bird looking best possible spot build nest in. The spot Willie sought would require least labour least material make room. Before he heard voice Tibby, calling come his porridge, he fixed upon one; following chapter I tell led choose it. All time morning afternoon school, he spent place; he came home evening, he accompanied Mr Spelman, went straight ruins. There good together; Willie length came in, his mother saw his face usually radiant, certain he new scheme his head. CHAPTER XIII. WILLIE'S NEST IN THE RUINS. The spot he fixed upon part ruins next cottage, many yards back door it. I said still vaulted places ground-level used family. The vault wood-house perfectly sound weather-tight, and, therefore, Willie carpenter agreed, quite safe roost upon. In corner outside, open elements, small winding stone stair, led room above, broken fragments which, projecting two sides corner, possible climb, reach top vault. Willie often got look small, flat-arched window garden manse. When Mr Shepherd, clergyman, often walked his garden, caught sight him, he always came nearer, chat him; he mind people Willie looking his garden, seeing he about. Sometimes also little Mona, girl his age, would running about; she also, she caught sight Willie, sure come hopping skipping like bird talk him, beg take her up, which, he often assured her, impossible. To place Mr Spelman Willie climbed, held consultation whether could made habitable. The main difficulty was, cover in; although walls quite sound long way up, lay open sky. But ten feet heads saw opposing holes two walls joists formerly sustaining floor chamber rested; Mr Spelman thought that, without large outlay either time material, he could lay floor, were, turn roof covering cement, pitch, something sort, concerning he would take counsel his friend Mortimer, mason. "But," said Willie, "that would turn bottom cistern; walls would hold rain in, would happen then? Either must gather till reached top, weight would burst walls, perhaps break roof drown me." "It easy avoid that," said Mr Spelman. "We lay cement little thicker one side, slope surface other, hole wall, pipe it, would let water off." "I know!" cried Willie. "That is called gurgoyle!" "I do not know anything that," said carpenter; "I know carry water." "To sure," said Willie. "It is capital." "But," said Mr Spelman, "it is rather serious job set asking doctor's leave. It cost money." "Much?" asked Willie, whose heart sank within him. "Well, depends count much," answered Spelman. "All I say is, would not anything father's pocket." "I do not see be," said Willie. "--Cost money, yet nothing father's pocket! _I've_ got threepence ha'-penny." "Your father I talk it," said carpenter mysteriously, offered information. "There seems always way thing," thought Willie himself. He little knew roundabout succession effect his father's kindness Spelman moment returning him, one links connection project Willie's own. The doctor time, carpenter called later evening; long talk together--to following effect. Spelman set forth his scheme, doctor listened silence he finished-- "But," said Mr Macmichael, "that cost good deal, I fear, I money spare." "Mr Macmichael," said Spelman solemnly, his long face looking awful doom issue middle it, "you forget much I debt." "No, I do not," returned doctor. "But neither I forget takes time labour provide family; become set job, return prospect satisfaction clearing old debt?" "It good you, sir, think that," said carpenter; "but, begging pardon, I have thought too. Many's time you have come I would ha' called work hours see wife--yes, middle night, twice; should not I same? Look ye here, sir. If you are main hurry, an'  will give time, I will heavy work job six of the clock summer nights, Sandy help me, I will charge journeyman's wages hour. And Willie Sandy themselves--he is clever boy Sandy; he is genius Willie--what themselves, that is little, nothing me. And you will goodness, I give honest time, fourpence ha'penny hour, strike much bill, I will obliged I now. Only I fear I must make pay material--not farthing costs saw-mills, Grange, carriage  will come lots I _must_ have." "It is generous offer, Spelman," said doctor, "and I accept heartily, though turning tables obligation upon me. You will done far I ever you." "I wish like true, sir, is not. My wife's giantess yet, you have done her." Spelman set work once. New joists inserted old walls, boarded over, covered, advice Mortimer, cunning mixture keep water. Then pipe put wall carry off--which pipe, masked awful head, remains one Priory showed would days monks, yet work faithfully without it. When came plastering walls, Mr Spelman, giving full directions, left two boys them. Although occasion roughen walls clearing away old mortar stones, weather done quite sufficiently, preparation wanted first thin coat well washed down, took good many days, working time, lay orthodox three coats plaster. Mr Spelman wisely boarded ceiling, plaster that. Meantime he preparing door window-frames shop. The room probably one prior's, much large lofty mere cell, two windows. But fortunately small, like splendid ones chapel refectory, else would hard fill glass. "I am afraid you will starved cold, Willie," said his father one day, watching boys work minutes. "There is fireplace." "Oh! does not signify," answered Willie. "Look thick walls are! I shall plenty blankets bed. Besides, easily put little stove in, it is wanted." But windows fitted fixed, Mr Macmichael saw his dismay made open. They even pane hinges. "This will never do, Willie," he said. "This far worse chimney." Willie took his father coat, led corner, hole went right wall another room--if called room neither floor ceiling. "There, father!" he said; "I going fit slide hole, I let much little air I please." "It would better one least windows made open. You get air ruins way, whereas might scents Mr Shepherd's wallflowers roses." "As soon Mr Spelman done job," said Willie, "I make come wide open hinges; I do not want bother it, he kind, I quite well myself." This satisfied his father. At length floor boarded; strong thick door fitted tight; winding stair deal inserted stone one been, cased planks, well pitched outside; Willie's mother busy making little muslin curtains his windows, carpet middle room. In meantime, his father mother written his grandmother, telling her Willie using his powers invention labour make room her, urging her come live them, anxious her take care of. But, fact, small persuasion necessary, old lady glad accept invitation; warm weather autumn over, she ready go them. By time Willie's room furnished. All things his former nest moved it; bed chintz curtains, covered strange flowers birds; old bureau, many drawers inside folding cover, he kept his little treasures; table he read books big hold, Raleigh's History World Josephus; old oblong mirror hung wall, outspread gilt eagle top it; big old arm-chair belonged his great-grandfather, wrote his sermons it--for things boy old, his after-life he never could bear new furniture. And his grandmother's furniture began appear; great cart-load her best bedroom speedily arranged Willie's late quarters, soon ready her, Mrs Macmichael set post-chaise fetch her mother. CHAPTER XIV. WILLIE'S GRANDMOTHER. Willie state excitement she arrived, looking her eagerly she young princess. So opportunities travelling Priory Leas town his grandmother lived, he never seen her, curiosity influence well affection. Great, therefore, his delight last chaise came round corner street, began draw order halt door. The first thing he caught sight curious bonnet, like black coal-scuttle upside down, inside which, turned front towards him, he saw close-fitting widow's cap, inside kind old face, he could looked still further, he would seen kind young soul inside kind old face. She smiled sweetly she saw him, tired take notice she tea. During meal Willie devoted silent waiting upon her, watching trying anticipate her every want. When she eaten little bread butter egg, drunk two cups tea, she lay back her easy chair, placed her side parlour fire, fell fast asleep ten minutes, breathing gently Willie got frightened, thought she dead. But she opened her eyes wide, made sign come her. "Sit there," she said, pushing little footstool towards him. Willie obeyed, sat looking her face. "So," she said, "you are little man everything?" "No, grannie," answered Willie, laughing. "I wish I could; I learning things; there is one I right yet." "Do know call you?" "The boys school call Six-fingered Jack," said Willie. "There!" said his grandmother. "I told so." "I am glad it is nickname, grannie; were not, would soon one, I am certain finger came little one would much way would soon get cut off." "Anyhow, supposing half clever fellow pass for, I want try you. Have objection service? I like hire servant--my special servant, understand." "All right, grannie; I am!" cried Willie, jumping up. "What shall I first?" "Sit instantly, wait till we have finished bargain. I must first understand though I do not want hard upon you, must come I call you, I tell you." "Of course, grannie. Only I cannot I am school, know." "I do not want told that. And I am going tyrant. But I idea silly! For cleverness, you have positively never asked wages I would give you." "Oh! I do not want wages, grannie. I _like_ things people; you are grandmother, besides, know." "Well, I suppose I must settle wages you. I mean pay job. It is odd arrangement servant, suit best. And do not ask any, I need not pay I like myself." "Certainly not, grannie. I am quite satisfied." "Meantime, engagement servant ought counted complete without earnest." "I am quite earnest, grannie," said Willie, know meaning word his new mistress used it. They laughed. "I do not see what is funny," said Willie, laughing too, however. But explained _earnest_ meant, he laughed understanding, well good will. "So," his grandmother went on, "I give earnest, which, know, binds servant. But long, Willie?" "Till you are tired me, grannie. Only, know, I am papa mamma's servant first, may arrange sometimes; I want once?" "We will easily manage that. I will arrange them, say. And now, here is earnest." As she spoke, she put his hand Willie took shilling. But he glanced it, he found mistaken. "Thank you, grannie," he said, trying show little disappointed, he another scheme his head days, shilling would everything towards that. "Do know grannie given you, Willie?" said his mother. "Yes, mother--such pretty brass medal!" "Show me, dear. Why, Willie! it is brass medal, child;--it is sovereign!" "No-o-o-o! Is it? O grannie!" he cried, went dancing room, he would actually fly delight. Willie never seen sovereign, part country like Holland--you never saw gold money there. To get him, his grandmother send bank county town. After she would often give sixpence shilling, sometimes even half-crown she asked anything she thought little harder usual; Willie plenty money carry his little plans. When remonstrated her daughter giving much, his grandmother would say-- "Look boy spends it!--always _doing_ something it! He never wastes sweets--not he!--My Willie's that!" The old lady generally spoke she chief sole proprietor boy. "I am sure I could not better it," she would add; "and you will see he comes man. He will making all." "But, mother, cannot afford it." "How know that? I afford well. I have house-rent pay; I certain best return I make kindness. What I Willie prove done us all." Certainly Willie's grandmother showed herself wise old lady. The wisest old ladies always young souls looking eyes. And things pleased Willie waiting upon her. He passion useful, his grandmother needed his help one else, her presence house endless source pleasure him. But his father grew anxious. He like her giving Willie much money--not he minded Willie spending money, he believed spending would keep hurting him; he feared lest her gifts purity boy's love his grandmother might injured, service first looked her end might degenerate mere serving her sake her shillings. He had, therefore, long talk her it. She indignant notion least danger spoiling Willie, anxious prove none she agreed test proposed his father--which was, drop money transactions months, giving Willie reason change. Grannie, however, word manner, possible, still kinder ever--and wonder, seeing she could more, present, let her love her pocket-hole--and Willie having, therefore, anxiety lest he displeased her, he soon ceased think even change; except, indeed, sometimes he wanted little money much, he would say he afraid poor grannie liberal first, spent her money upon him; therefore he must try attentive her now. So result satisfactory; that, her boasting, his grandmother able help trembling little, half annoyance, half anxiety, she let first his services pass without customary acknowledgment. "There!" she said one day, length, triumphantly, Mr Macmichael; "what think Willie now? Three months gone, fears? I hope trust judgment little better this." "I am glad, anyhow, put trial," said his father. "It good." "He wants less people, Mr Macmichael--present company _not_ excepted," said old lady, rather nettled, pretending she really was. CHAPTER XV. HYDRAULICS. The first thing Willie did, getting his room himself, put hinges windows make open, satisfying his father airiness room. Finding then, were, house his own, he began ask his friends village come see his new quarters. The first Mrs Wilson, Mr Spelman followed. Hector Macallaster unwell, month he able go; first day he could he crawled hill Ruins, little winding stair Willie's nest. The boy delighted see him, made sit his great arm-chair, and, poor man tired exertion, would run house get something; Hector begged little water, declared he could take nothing else. Therefore Willie got tumbler his dressing-table, went side room. Hector, hearing splashing rushing, turned round look, saw one hand small wooden trough ran along wall, holding tumbler stream water fell side trough his bath. When tumbler full, he removed his hand trough, water ceased overflow. He carried tumbler Hector, drank, said water delicious. Hector could imagine running water got there, Willie tell I going tell reader. His grandmother's sovereign his hydraulics brought there. He thinking time pleasure would stream running his room, much labour would save poor old Tibbie; light matter her old limbs carry water his bath steep narrow winding stair his room. He reasoned well rose overflowed outlet stopped, might rise yet farther still confined; source probably heart one surrounding hills, water confined always rise high source. Therefore, much meditation could accomplished simplest least expensive manner, he set follows. First he cleared away floor well, built circular wall foot two higher, stones picked lying about, mortar he made himself. By means spirit-level, he laid top layer stones quite horizontal; he introduced several blocks wood instead stones. Next he made small wooden frame, which, driving spikes stones, he fastened opening underground passage, well-fitting piece board could move it, means projecting handle, manageable sluice he hitherto had. Then he made strong wooden lid mouth well, screwed wooden blocks he built in. Through hole it, large enough, came handle sluice. Next, middle cover, he made hole brace centre-bit, drove end strong iron pipe, fitting tight, long enough reach almost top vault. As soon fixed he shut sluice, seconds water falling sheets upon him, flooding floor, dashed back vault, rushed top pipe. This enough present; he raised sluice let water escape below. It plain, force water struck vault, would yet rise much higher. He scrambled top vault, and, examining ruins, soon saw pipe brought breach vault could led hole wall his room he shown his father ventilator. But he would close pipe running his room. There would little good that. He could made hole it, stopper, let water he wanted use it, would awkward, pleasure lay seeing water ran. Therefore he got Mr Spelman find long small pine tree, he first sawed two, lengthways, hollowed two troughs; then, laying small end one wide end other, he spout long enough reach across room, go wall sides. The chief difficulty pierce wall, mortar hard. The stones, however, large, and, Sandy's help, he managed it. The large end one trough put ventilator-hole, small end hole opposite; second ends met middle, one lying other, supported juncture prop. They filled two openings round ends lime small stones, making tidy could, fitting small slides Willie could close passages water he pleased. Nothing remained solder lead pipe top iron one, guide flexible tube across ups downs ruins, lay end trough. At length Willie took his stand sluice, told Sandy scramble end lead pipe, shout water began pour trough. His object find far sluice required shut order send much water pipe could deliver. More would pressure might strain, perhaps burst, apparatus. He pushed sluice little, waited moment. "Is coming yet, Sandy?" he cried. "Not drop," shouted Sandy. Willie pushed little further, knew change gurgle water rising well; soon began spout hole cover sluice-handle came up. "It is coming," cried Sandy, pause; "not much, though." Down went sluice little still. "It is pouring," echoed voice Sandy amongst ruins; "as much ever pipe give. Its mouth quite full." Willie raised sluice little. "How now?" he bawled. "Less," cried Sandy. So Willie pushed back last, made notch handle know right place again. So water Prior's Well went careering Willie's bed-chamber, story high. When he wanted fill his bath, he stop run his hand, poured sides it; Tibbie henceforth relieved great labour, Willie's eyes delighted vision, his ears sounds water scampering his room. An hour after, he finishing something mouth well, he heard his father calling him. "Willie, Willie," he shouted, "is kelpie work?" "What it, father?" cried Willie, he came bounding him. He needed reply he saw great pool water back door, fed small stream direction woodhouse. Tibbie come out, looking dismay. "That is Willie again, sir," she saying. "You never tell he will spouting weary water you." [Illustration: TIBBIE, LOOKING ON IN DISMAY, SAID, "THAT IS WILLIE AGAIN."] The whole place'll bog long, we will turned frogs, nothing croak. That well  will ruin us cold coughs." "You will glad enough to-night, Tibbie," said Willie, laughing prophetically. "A likely story!" she returned, quite cross. "It will house do not stop it." "I will soon that," said Willie. Neither he Sandy thought would become water traversed chamber. There pouring end wooden spout, clearing tarred roof spiral stair, plashing ground close foot it; eagerness never thought would run next. And Willie puzzled. Nothing easier stop present, course he ran do; he send it? Thinking it, however, he remembered side wall stable his father's horses lived, close parson's garden; corner, foot wall, drain; he fit another spout this, right angles it, carry wall. "You need not take water tonight, Tibby," he said, he went supper, he already filled his bath. "Nonsense, Willie," returned Tibbie, still temper mess door. "Your papa says must bath, poor old bones must ache 't." "The bath's filled already. If put one pailful, it will run I get it." "Now, do not play tricks _me_, Willie. I will not joking," returned Tibbie. Nettled way she took information he hoped please her, he left her carry her pail water; last, she thanked kindly next day. The remaining question get rid bath-water. But he soon contrived sink top step stair outside door, little higher wall stable-yard. From short pipe sufficient carry water also drain. I may mention, although severe winter followed, Prior's Well never froze; that, always either empty, full _running_ water, pipes never froze, consequently never burst. CHAPTER XVI. HECTOR HINTS AT A DISCOVERY. The next day Hector's visit, Willie went see he was, found better. "I certainly better," he said, "and what is more, I have got strange feeling drink water gave yesterday done it. I am coming evening, you will give me." "As much _you_ drink, Hector, anyhow," said Willie. "You will not drink _my_ cow dry." "I wonder could water," said Hector, musingly. "My father says people used think cured them. That hundreds years ago; then, I do not see should not now. My mother certainly better, whether began since found well, I cannot sure. For Tibbie--she always drinking it, she says her world good." "I have read somewhere," said shoemaker, "that wherever there is hurt there is help; I boy, stung nettle, I never far look dock-stalk juice. Who knows Prior's Well may cure me? It cannot straighten back, I know, may make stronger that, fitter general business." "I lay pipe you, like, Hector, drink much water please, without asking anybody," said Willie. Hector laughed. "It is sure thing," he replied, "as worth trouble; besides, walk good, drink twice day enough--that is, people will not think trouble, coming often." "There is fear that," said Willie; "it is business, know, try cure people. I will tell what--could not bring bit work, sit room sometimes? It is better air here." "You are kind, indeed, Willie. We will see. Meantime, I will come morning evening, drink water, long least warm weather lasts, time I shall pretty certain whether good not." So Hector went drinking water getting little better. Next, grannie took it, and, either imagination, really her good, declared renewing her youth. All doctor said matter was, salts contained could one harm, might people much good; iron it, strengthening, certain ingredients besides, might possibly prevent iron interfering functions system. He said he surprised if, day other, regained old fame well healing. Mr Spelman, consequence talk he Hector, induced his wife try it, she also soon began think her good. Beyond I mentioned, one paid attention Prior's Well renascent reputation. CHAPTER XVII. HOW WILLIE WENT ON. As soon Willie began new study, he began trying get sense it. This caused his progress slow first, appear dull amongst merely learned rote; he got hold meaning all, his progress grew faster faster, length studies he outstripped rest. I need hardly repeat constant exercise his mind his fingers, giving second existence outside first existence inside him--that is, his mind, made far easier understand relations things go make science. A boy could put box together must find Euclid easier--the Second Book particularly--than one idea practical relations boundaries spaces; one could contrive machine like his water-wheel, must able understand interdependence parts sentence better one equally gifted otherwise, know one wheel could move another. Everything he would help his arithmetic, geography, history; things besides, would help understand poetry. In his Latin sentences he found parts fit like dove-tailing; finding terms equations, he said, like inventing machines, he soon grew clever solving them. It his manual abilities alone his father given name Gutta-Percha Willie, fact his mind, warmed interest, could accommodate peculiarities science, gutta-percha used taking mould fits outs ins figure. He still employed his water-wheel pull bed middle night. He had, course, make considerable alterations in, rather additions to, machinery, changing his bed-room, work direction right angles former; he managed perfectly. It well Willie's reputation certain, small class readers, something even would call useful several his inventions many his efforts; his hydraulics, instance, means he saved old Tibby's limbs; his house-building, too, means able take grannie; and, long time now, he every little repair wanted house. If lock went wrong, he would taken pieces. If less would do, he carried smithy, seldom troubled Mr Willett it, he learned small jobs, heat work temper piece iron within his strength well man. His mother much like part his general apprenticeship, he would get his hands black sometimes Saturday afternoon he could get clean enough church next day; sometimes he would come home little holes burnt his clothes sparks red-hot iron beaten anvil. Concerning last evil, she spoke length Hector, made leather apron, like Mr Willett's, thereafter he always wore he job smithy. It well, I say, utility his doings admitted all; objects upon he spent much labour would, people, regarded utterly useless. Few, instance, would allow value water-wheel could grind corn, service wake middle night--not work, learning single lesson, he might stare window while, get bed again. For part, nevertheless, I think useful contrivance. For lovely sights tend keep soul pure, lift heart God, above, merely people call low cares, people would call reasonable cares, although great Teacher teaches us cares unjust towards Father Heaven. More that, helping keep mind calm pure, help keep imagination, source invention, active, judgment, weighs suggestions, just. Whatever beautiful God, ignorance low condition heart soul prize beautiful. If I choice two mills, one would set fine dinners table, one would show lovely sights earth sky sea, I know I count useful. Perhaps much said next whim Willie's; part least I written apply also. What put his head I sure, I think two things together--seeing soaring lark radiant light unrisen sun, finding corner Spelman's shop large gilt ball belonged old eight-day clock he bought. The passage he set low he remove ornaments top it, one humbled might exalted. The sight set Willie thinking he could it; he meditated thing, sometimes make thing do. Nor long ere he made his mind, set huge kite, six feet high--a great strong monster, tail portentous length--to top arch he attached golden ball. Then he bought quantity string, set his wheel call hour sunrise. One morning still, another cloudy, third wet; last came one clear cool, steady breeze sent leaves black poplars one way. He dressed speed, and, taking his kite string, set grass field belonging Farmer Thomson, he found daisies still buttoned sleep, red tips together, tight close lips baby will not take offered it--as never meant anything sun, would never show little golden sun inside them. In minutes kite begun soar, slowly steadily, faster faster, length towering aloft, tugging pulling string, he could let fast enough. He kept looking intently rose, suddenly new morning star burst golden glitter. It gilt ball; saw sun. The glory which, striking heart lark, transmuted song, came back ball, kind, glow gleam. He danced delight, shouted sang his welcome resurrection sun, he watched his golden ball alone depth air. He never thought one hearing him, likely one village would yet. He therefore good deal surprised he heard sweet voice Mona Shepherd behind him; turning, saw her running bare-headed, her hair flying wind. "Willie! Willie!" she crying, half-breathless haste buffeting breeze. "Well, Mona, would thought seeing early?" "May not girl get early, well boy? It is like climbing walls trees, know, though I cannot see harm either." "No I," said Willie, "if they are difficult, know. But brought now? Do want me?" "May not I stop you? I saw looking up, I looked too, I saw something flash; I dressed hard I could, ran out. Are catching lightning?" "No," said Willie; "something better lightning--the sunlight." "Is all?" said Mona, disappointed. "Why, Mona, is not sunlight better thing lightning?" said philosophical Willie. "Yes, I dare say; time." "That makes valuable. But it is quite true think it. You cannot now, except ball." "Oh, yes, I can," cried Mona; "for he comes himself." And there, sure, first blinding arc sun rising eastern hill. Both forgot kite, turned watch great marvel heavens, throbbing pulsing like sea flame. When turned kite could see golden ball longer. Its work over; told sun coming, now, sun come, wanted more. Willie began draw his string roll stick, slowly pulling earth soaring sun-scout he sent aloft news. He never flown anything like large kite before, he found difficult reclaim. "Will take next time, Willie?" asked Mona, pleadingly. "I like morning, wind blowing, clouds flying about. I wonder everybody does not get see sun rise. Do not think well worth seeing?" "That I do." "Then let come you? I like much better me. Janet spoils all." Janet her old nurse, seemed think main part her duty check Mona's enthusiasm. "I will," said Willie, "if papa objection." Mona even remember her mamma. She died she little thing. "Come ask him, then," said Mona. So soon he secured Sun-scout, he called his kite golden head, she took his hand lead her father. "He will not yet," said Willie. "Oh, yes, long ago," cried Mona. "He is always first house, soon he is dressed he calls me. He will breakfast time, wondering become me." So Willie went her, Mr Shepherd, she said, already seated breakfast. "What about, Mona, child?" he asked, soon he shaken hands Willie. "We have helping sun rise," said Mona, merrily. "No, no," said Willie; "we have peep bed, he got up." "Oh, yes," chimed Mona. "And he fast asleep!--and snoring," she added, comical expression tone, thing mentioned save secret. But Willie like word, her father mind. "No, no," said Mr Shepherd; "that is respectful, Mona. I do not like talk way, even fun, great light earth. There good reasons objecting would quite understand yet. Willie would talk like that, I sure. Tell about, boy." Willie explained whole matter, asked he might call Mona next time he went his kite morning. Mr Shepherd consented once; Mona said he call his window garden, she would sure hear even she asleep. The next thing Willie construct small windlass garden, wind let string kite; next fit morning arrived, Mona he went together. The wind blowing right garden, go open field, sent kite windlass, Mona able means winch let string, Willie kept watching moment golden ball catch light. They several mornings after, Willie managed, master's help, calculate exactly height ball flown first gained peep sun bed. One windy evening sent kite hope would fly till morning; wind fell night, sun came near golden ball air greet him. So, instead rejoicing glitter far aloft, set out, guided string, find fallen Lucifer. The kite small consequence, golden ball Willie could replace. Alas! evening he added great length string--so much, wind ceased kite could reach river, fell; searchers length drew Sun-scout water found his glory departed; golden ball beaten ground upon stones stream, never send climbing heavens welcome lord day. Indeed, many years Willie flew kite again, for, certain conversation his grandmother, he began give good deal time his lessons hitherto; his recreations continued practical sort, his reading mostly prepared college. CHAPTER XVIII. WILLIE'S TALK WITH HIS GRANDMOTHER. One evening winter, he putting coals his grannie's fire, she told take chair beside her, she wanted little talk him. He obeyed her gladly. "Well, Willie," she said, "what would like be?" Willie helping shoe horse smithy, and, fact, driven one nails--an operation perilous horse. Full thing last occupied him, he answered without moment's hesitation-- "I like blacksmith, grannie." The old lady smiled. She seen black Willie's hands could come coals, judged his answer he come smithy. An unwise grandmother, she wished turn notion, would started objection once--probably calling dirty trade, dangerous trade, trade son professional man could allowed follow; Willie's grandmother knew better, went talking thing quietest manner. "It is fine trade," she said; "thorough manly work, healthy, I believe, notwithstanding heat. But would take it, Willie?" Willie fell back his principles, thought minute. "Of course, I am good I must hand Hector calls general business universe, grannie." "To sure; that, smith, would have; choose smith rather anything else world?" "Because--because--people cannot get without horse-shoes, ploughs harrows, tires cart-wheels, locks, that. It would help people much I smith." "I do not doubt it. But mason could quite much make comfortable; could build houses." "Yes, I could. It would delightful build houses people. I like that." "It is hard work," said his grandmother. "Only would not mind that, I know, Willie." "No man minds hard work," said Willie. "I think I like mason; then, see, I able look I done. The ploughs carts would go away sight, good houses would stand I built them, I able see comfortable people them. I come nearer people way work. Yes, grannie, I would rather mason smith." "A carpenter fits houses inside," said his grandmother. "Do not think, his work, he comes nearer people live mason does?" "To sure," cried Willie, laughing. "People hardly see mason's work, except they are coming door. I know carpenter's work too. _Yes_, grannie, I settled now; I will carpenter--there!" cried Willie, jumping his seat. "If had not Mr Spelman, I do not see could _you_ us, grannie. Think that!" "Only, tailor shoemaker, would come still nearer people themselves." "I do not know much tailoring," returned Willie. "I could stitch well enough, I could not cut out. I could soon shoemaker, though. I have done everything wanted shoe boot hands already; Hector tell so. I could begin shoemaker to-morrow. That nearer carpenter. Yes." "I going suggest," said his grannie, "that there is kind work goes yet nearer people helps those. But, course, you have made mind"-- "Oh no, grannie! I do not mean much that--if there is better way, know. Tell is." "I want think find out." Willie thought, looked puzzled, said he could not tell was. "Then must think little longer," said his grandmother. "And go wash hands." CHAPTER XVIX. A TALK WITH Mr SHEPHERD. In minutes Willie came rushing back his room, his hands face half wet half dry. "Grannie! grannie!" he panted--"what stupid I am! How body stupid! Of course mean doctor's work! My father comes nearer people help anybody else can--and yet I never thought meant. How know thing know moment?" "Well, you have found I meant, think it?" said his grandmother. "Why, course, it is best all. When I little fellow, I used think I doctor day, I do not feel quite sure now. Do really think, grannie, I _could_ doctor like papa? You see wants good head--and--and--everything." "Yes; want good head everything. But you have got good enough head begin with, depends make better one. So long people's hearts keep growing better, heads same. I think every faculty making good doctor you." "Do really think so, grannie?" cried Willie, delighted. "I indeed." "Then I shall ask papa teach me." But Willie find his papa quite ready take hand. "No, Willie," he said. "You must learn great many things would much use commence part. I teach like, school-hours, compound certain medicines; important thing get school. You quite old enough work home too; though I do not want confine lessons, I like spend couple hours every evening. You remainders evenings, mornings breakfast, greater parts half-holidays, whatever like another sort." Willie never required urging his father wished. He became student, without becoming much less workman--for he found plenty time he wanted, careful his odd moments. One lovely evening spring, sun gone left air soft, balmy, full scents rise earth shower, odours buds swelling bursting directions, Willie standing looking his open window parson's garden, Mr Shepherd saw called him-- "Come here, Willie," he said. "I want little talk you." Willie got wall top his stair, dropped stable-yard, served parson's pony well Doctor's two horses, thence passed Mr Shepherd's garden, two began walk together. The year like child waking sleep he fallen crying. Its life returning it, fresh new. It God drawing nigh His world. All winter He never left it, had, were, rolling along path Him; taken His hand, carrying while; birds singing sweetly, buds coming blithely doors, wind blew soft, rain fell repentantly, earth sent gracious odour. "The year coming again, Willie--growing busy more," Mr Shepherd said. "Yes," answered Willie. "It is dead, come life again. It must doctor it." "Eh? What doctor, Willie?" "Well, know, One could doctor big world." "Yes, surely," returned Mr Shepherd. "And brings I wanted talk about. I hear father means make doctor you." "Yes. Is not good him?" said Willie. "Then would like it?" "Yes; I should!" "Why would like it?" "Because I _must_ hand general business." "What mean that?" Willie set forth Hector Macallaster's way thinking matters. "Very good--very good indeed!" remarked Mr Shepherd. "But why, then, prefer doctor shoemaker? Is get better paid it?" "I never thought that," returned Willie. "Of course I better paid--for Hector could not keep horse, horse I must have, else patients would dead I could get them. But that is I want doctor. It is I want help people." "What makes want help people?" "Because it is best thing yourself." "Who told that?" "I do not know. It seems everybody everything teaching that, ever since I remember." "Well, it is wonder seem everything taught that, seeing God always doing--and Jesus taught us law His kingdom--which real kingdom--namely, greatest man he gives help people. It Jesus Himself so--giving Himself utterly--that God highly exalted Him given Him name every name. And, indeed, good doctor, something Jesus He world." "Yes; He did not give people medicine cure them." "No; was not necessary, He Himself cure. But He present His bodily presence--now, medicine advice good things packets He wraps healing He sends; wisest doctor messenger carries sick much healing help Great Doctor sees fit send. For He anxious cure thoroughly many cases He cure once." "How I _should_ like take His healing about!" cried Willie--"just doctors' boys take medicines baskets: grannie tells big towns. I _should_ like Great Doctor's boy!" "You really think then," Mr Shepherd resumed, pause, "that doctor's best way helping people?" "Yes, I do," answered Willie, decidedly. "A doctor, see, comes nearest his help. It is outside man's body he helps, his inside health--how he feels, know." Mr Shepherd thought moments. At length he said-- "What is difference father's work mine?" "A great difference, course," replied Willie. "Tell is?" "I must think I that," said Willie. "It is easy put things words!--You often go help people: that is something start with." "But give help." "No, quite. And yet"-- "At least, I cannot write prescriptions compound medicines them, seeing I know nothing things," said Mr Shepherd. "But, hand, though I cannot give medicine papa's basket, papa often gives medicine mine." "That is riddle, I suppose," said Willie. "No, it is not. How papa come near people help them?" "He gives things make well again." "What things he gives them?" "They take them." "How?" "Put mouths swallow them." "Could not take ears?" "No," answered Willie, laughing. "Why not?" "Because ears are not meant taking them." "Are not ears meant taking anything, then?" "Only words." "Well, one try, might not words mixed medicine?" "I do not see how." "If take strong words, persuasive words, tender words, might not mix so--that is, set order--as make good medicine sore heart, instance?" "Ah! I see, I see! Yes, medicine heart must go ears." "Not necessarily. It might go eyes. Jesus gave eyes, doubting hearts, He said--Consider lilies,--consider ravens." "At ears, too, though," said Willie; "just papa sometimes gives medicine taken rubbed both." "Only ears could done nothing words eyes had not taken things first. But medicine go to, Willie?" "I suppose must go heart, that is place wants healing." "Does go doctor would call heart, then?" "No, no; must go what--to clergyman--to _you_ call heart." "And heart nearer person himself?" Willie thought moment, answered, merrily--the doctor's heart, sure!" "No, Willie; you are wrong there," said Mr Shepherd, looking, he felt, little disappointed. "Oh yes, please!" said Willie; "I am almost sure I am right time." "No, Willie; clergyman calls heart nearest man himself." "No, no," persisted Willie. "The heart you have got _is_ man himself. So course doctor's heart nearer man." Mr Shepherd laughed low, pleasant laugh. "You are quite right, Willie. You have got best it. I am pleased. But then, Willie, does not strike might closer way helping men doctor's way?" Again Willie thought while. "There would be," he said, length, "if could give medicine make happy miserable." "Even doctor little that," returned Mr Shepherd; "for good health people much happier ill." "If could give would make good bad then," said Willie. "Ah, it!" rejoined Mr Shepherd. "That closest way helping men." "But nobody that--nobody make bad man good--but God," said Willie. "Certainly. But He uses medicines; He sends people them, like doctors' boys speaking of. What else _I_ for? I have carrying His medicines good many years now." "Then _your_ work father's comes nearest people help all! My father's work, I see, does not help man himself; helps his body--or best his happiness: does not go deep enough touch himself. But helps man. Yours best all." "I do not know," returned Mr Shepherd, thoughtfully. "It depends, I think, kind preparation gone through." "Oh yes!" said Willie. "You go theological classes. I must course take medical." "That is true, it is true enough," said Mr Shepherd. "That would not make fraction difference I mean. There is one preparation essential man would carry best sort medicines. Can think is? It is necessary sort." "The man must good," said Willie. "I suppose that is it." "That does not make difference exactly," returned Mr Shepherd. "It necessary doctor good parson." "Yes," said Willie; "but though doctor bad man, his medicines might good." "Not means likely be!" said parson. "You never sure anything bad man good. It may be, man bad; cannot sure it. We coming nearer now. Might not parson's medicines good he bad well doctor's?" "Less likely still, I think," said Willie. "The words might right sort, would like medicines lain his drawers stood his bottles till good them." "You are coming near difference preparation I wanted point you," said Mr Shepherd. "It this: physician men's _selves_, commonly called _souls_, must taken must keep taking medicine he carries him; less doctor wants his better." "I see, I see," cried Willie, fitting phrase, figure, form expressing thing, pleased much clever machine--"I see! It is right! I understand now." "But," Mr Shepherd went on, "your father carries sorts medicines his basket. He healthy man I believe he seldom uses his medicines; he always taking sort, that is makes fit carry about. He far good among sick I can. Many do not like medicine, yet take little father mixes his, he wonderful art doing. I hope, turn comes, able help man himself, father does." "Do want doctor _your_ kind, Mr Shepherd?" "No. It wrong thing take basket without told Him makes medicine. If He wants man so, He let know--He call tell it. But everybody ought take medicine, everybody needs it; happy thing is, that, soon anyone found good is--food wine upholding things one--he becomes able anxious give others. If would help people much father does, must begin taking real medicine yourself." This conversation gave Willie good deal think about. And he much need think it, soon he left his father's house first time his life, went great town, receive little preparation college. The next year he gained scholarship, or, call there, _bursary_, fully occupied classics mathematics, hoping, however, next year, combine certain scientific studies bearing less indirectly upon duties medical man. CHAPTER XX. HOW WILLIE DID HIS BEST TO MAKE A BIRD OF AGNES. During time he college, he often think Mr Shepherd said him. When he tempted self-indulgence, thought would always rise way become able help people, especially real selves them; and, amongst medical students, he could help thinking much better doctors would make would try medicine basket themselves. He thought especially he saw cared nothing patients, neither desire take part general business work's sake, wanted practice might make living. For nearly unfit healers body, mere professional clergymen healers broken hearts wounded minds. To man good way, must sympathise him--that is, know he feels, reflect feeling mirror; good doctor, one must love heal; must honour art physician rejoice it; must give it, he may learn he can--from root love branches theory, leaves fruits healing. He always came home Priory Leas summer intervals, may sure great rejoicing--loudest part Agnes, his constant companion, much so, least, she allowed. Willie saw good deal Mona Shepherd also, long set free oppressive charge Janet, care governess, wise, elderly lady; she great friend Mrs Macmichael, two families even together former years. Of course, college he time work his hands: his labour must his head; he came home he plenty time sorts. He spent couple hours breakfast study physiology; breakfast, another hour two either surgery, part ruins he roughly fitted laboratory bench, shelves, furnace. His father, however, favour his latter long time together; young experimenters commonly careless, often neglect proper precautions--breathing, instance, many gases ought breathe. He careful Agnes, however, often he would let her all; he did, he generally confined her amusement. He would show her lovely things!--for instance, liquids changed one gorgeous hue another; bubbles burst flame, ascended rings white revolving smoke; light intense, seemed darken daylight. Sometimes Mona would party, nothing pleased Agnes her better wonderful things these; Willie found amusing hear Agnes, sharp enough pick chemical names, dropping big words her lips she familiar terms things signified--_phosphuretted hydrogen, metaphosphoric acid, sesquiferrocyanide iron_, like. Then he would give hour preparation studies next term; which, early dinner, he would work his bench turning-lathe, generally something his mother grandmother; he would little mason-work amongst ruins, patching strengthening, even buttressing, he thought danger fall--for he resolved that, he could help it, another stone come ground. In this, his first summer home college, he also fitted small forge--in part ruins wide chimney, whose vent ran long way unbroken. Here he constructed pair great bellows, set old anvil, he bought trifle Mr Willett; his father actually trusted shoe his horses; he ever find nail Willie's driving require drawn shoe give place new one. In afternoon, he always read history, tales, poetry; evening whatever he felt inclined do--which brings occupied last hours daylight, good part first summer. One lovely evening June, he came upon Agnes, eight years old, lying largest elm clump great elms Scotch firs bottom garden. They highest trees neighbourhood, his father fond them. To look elms summer time eyes seemed lose way mist leaves; whereas firs great, bony, bare, gaunt arms, tuft bristles there. But ray setting sun alighted upon one firs shone like flamingo. It seemed surly old tree gracious sunset secret them, which, often met, broke ruddy flame. Now Agnes lying thin grass clump trees, looking mystery--and--what else think she doing?--She sucking her thumb--her custom always she thoughtful; thoughtful she seemed now, tears her eyes. "What matter pet?" said Willie. But instead jumping flinging her arms him, she looked him, gave little sigh, drew her thumb her mouth, pointed tree, said, "I cannot get there! I wish I bird," put her thumb her mouth again. "But bird, would not girl, know, would not like that," said Willie--"at least _I_ should not like it." "_I_ should not mind. I would rather wings fly trees." "If wings could not arms." "I would rather wings." "If bird there, would sure wish girl here. For bird could not lie grass look tree." "Oh yes, I could." "What comical little bird would look then--lying little round feathery back, wings spread keep rolling over, little sparkling eyes, one side long beak, staring tree!--Miaw! Miaw! Here comes cat eat up!" Agnes sprang her feet terror, rushed Willie. She fully fancied herself bird mention cat filled her horror. Once she took her thumb her mouth give little scream, put again. "O Willie! frightened so!" she said--joining, however, his laugh. "Poor birdie!" said Willie. "Did naughty puss frighten it? Stwoke fedders den.--Stwoke it--stwoke it," he continued, smoothing her hair. "But _wouldn't_ nice," persisted Agnes, "to tall birds make wings? Fancy head green leaves--so cool! hearing whisper, whisper, ears, able look people's heads, know, Willie! I wish I bird! I do!" But Willie comfort play her, she soon forgot her soaring ambition. Willie, however, forget it. If Agnes wished enjoy privacy leaves height trees, should not she? At least, should not she he could help her it. Certainly he could not change her arms wings, cover her feathers, make her bones hollow air might get her, even her quills; he could get her tree, even something more, perhaps. He would see it--that is, he would think it, done he yet see. Long ago, almost moment he arrived, he set his wheel order, got his waking-machine working trim. And ever he enjoyed pulled bed middle night--especially fine weather; then, hushed hour night melting morn, earth looks she losing her dreams, yet begun recognise her thoughts, he would unfrequently go garden, wander thoughtful minutes. The night, his wheel pulled him, he rose went garden. The night odds morning which. An occasional bat would flit like doubtful shadow across his eyes, cool breath air roaming well, night all, plainly belonged morning. He wandered bottom garden--to clump trees, lay Agnes lying night before, thought thought he felt child felt she longed bird. What could he content her? He knew every bough old trees himself, scrambled like squirrel scores times; even he could get Agnes bare bole elm fir, he could trust her go scrambling branches. On hand, wherever he could go, he could surely somehow help Agnes go. Having gathered thought two, he went back bed. The next evening he set work spent whole following his bench, planing, shaping, generally preparing construction, plan clear his head. At length, third evening, he carried half dozen long poles, wheeled several barrowfuls short planks, measuring inches two feet, clump trees. At foot largest elm he began dig, intention inserting thick end one poles; he soon found impossible get half deep enough, tremendous roots tree, giving up, thought better plan. He set smithy, bought Mr Willett fifteen feet iron rod, dozen staples. Carrying home his small forge, he cut rod equal lengths little two feet, made hook ends length. Then he carried elm, drove six staples bole tree equal distances round it, foot ground; others he drove one six poles, foot thick end; he connected poles tree, hooked rod corresponding staples, tops poles reached first fork elm. Then he nailed bracket tree, height easy step ground, height nailed piece wood across two poles. Resting bracket piece wood, he laid first step stair, fastened firmly both. Another bracket little higher, another piece wood nailed two poles, raised next step; he went round round tree ascending spiral, climbing steps already placed fix others them. Encircling tree four five times, he wanted ascent easy little feet, he length fork. There he laid platform landing-place, paused consider next. This third evening laying first step. From fork many boughs rose spread--amongst two near other, he saw how, help various inequalities, he might build little straight staircase leading perfect wilderness leaves branches. He set once, and, although he found difficult he expected, succeeded last building safe stair boughs, hand-rail rope side. But Willie chosen ascend direction another reason well: one boughs close contact bough belonging one largest red firs. On fir-bough he constructed landing-place, upon easy possible step stair elm. Next, bough large, he laid along plank steadied blocks underneath--a level little feet. Then he began weave network rope string along side bough, child could fall off; finding rather long job, thinking pity balk her much pleasure merely sake surprising her thoroughly, he resolved reveal he already done, permit her enjoy it. For, I ought mentioned sooner, he taken Mona his confidence, she kept Agnes way nearly whole week evenings. But she finding difficult restrain her rushing search Willie, glad indeed he told her he going keep thing secret longer. [Illustration: WILLIE CARRIED AGNES UP THE STAIR INTO THE GREAT BRANCHES OF THE ELM TREE.] CHAPTER XXI. HOW AGNES LIKED BEING A BIRD. But Willie began think whether he might give Agnes two surprises it, dream bargain, thought he saw he could manage it. She always went bed seven of the clock, time people house began think retiring, she generally fast asleep. About ten of the clock, therefore, next night, great round moon peering horizon, quantity mackerel clouds ready receive her she rose yard two higher, Willie, taking soft shawl his mother's, went Agnes's room, wrapped her shawl, corner her head face, carried her garden, trees, stair midst great boughs branches elm tree. It warm night, soft breath south wind blowing, risk her taking cold. He uncovered her face, wake her, leaving change her position freshness air. Nor he disappointed. In moments she began stir, half-opened her eyes, shut them, opened again, rubbed them, drew deep breath, began lift her head Willie's shoulder, look her. Through thick leaves moon shining like great white fire, must looked her sleepy eyes almost within yard her. Even she half asleep, beheld leaves, would taken her make her mind huge bright thing was. Then she heard great fluttering leaves talking her, came soft wind blew her face, felt sweet pleasant. She rubbed her eyes again, could get sleep them. As last she said Willie, stood still stone--but her tongue her voice her lips could hardly make words she wanted utter: "Am I awake? Am I dreaming? It is nice!" Willie answer her, little head sunk his shoulder again. He drew corner shawl it, carried her back her bed. When he laid her down, she opened her eyes wide, stared face moment, she knew everything except she looking at, put her thumb her mouth, fast asleep. The next morning breakfast, her papa out, her mamma yet come down, she told Willie she beautiful dream!--that angel, great red wings, came took her his arms, flew her cloud lay close moon, stopped. The cloud made little birds kept fluttering wings talking other, fluttering wings made wind her face, wind made her happy, moon kept looking birds quite close them, smiling her, she saw face man moon quite plain. But grew dark began thunder, angel went fast, thunder clapping his big red wings, he flew her her mamma's room, laid her her crib, she looked he like Willie. "Do think dream could come wishing bird, Agnes?" asked Willie. "I do not know. Perhaps," replied Agnes. "Are angry wishing I bird, Willie?" "No, darling. What makes ask question?" "Because ever since will not let go you--when things, know." "Why, laboratory yesterday!" said Willie. "Yes, would not evening used let always. What amongst trees _always_ now?" "If patience go near day, I show evening." Agnes promised; Willie gave whole day getting things bit. Amongst things he wove network along bough Scotch fir, quite safe Agnes walk great red hole tree. There he content make pause present, constructing first, however, little chair bough branch rope twig she could safely sit. Just he finished chair, he heard her voice calling, tone grew pitiful. "Willie!--Willie!--Willie!--Willie!" He got ran find her. She window his room, she gone wait till he called her, her patience last given way. "I am _so_ tired, Willie! May not I come yet?" "Wait one moment more," said Willie, ran house his mother's shawl. As soon he began wrap her, Agnes said, thoughtfully-- "Somebody before--not long ago--I remember: angel dream." When Willie put corner her face, she said, "He too!" he took her his arms, she said, "He too! How funny angel dream!" Willie ran her ruins, house, stairs, garden many directions, he satisfied he must thoroughly bewildered her whereabouts were, last sped her stair fork elm-tree. There he threw back shawl, told her look. To see her first utterly bewildered expression--then slow glimmering dawn intelligence, she began understand she was--next gradual rise light her face came spring below, broke smile it, length she perceived he working at, he would not her him--gave Willie pleasure he hoped for--quite satisfied him, made count his labour well rewarded. "O Willie! Willie! me!--Was not now?" "Yes, was, pet," said Willie. "It make bird me--was not it?" she went on. "Yes--as much bird I could. I could not give wings, know, I had not fly moon, angel dream did. The dream much nicer--was not it?" "I am sure that--really I am not. I think nicer wind coming do not know where, making leaves flutter about, wings birdies making wind. And I do not care man moon much. He is nice you, Willie. And yon red ray sun fir-tree good nearly moon." "Oh! may moon, wait bit. She will late to-night, though." "But I think it, Willie," said Agnes, "I believe was not dream all." "Do think real angel carried really moon, then?" asked Willie. "No; real Willie carried really tree, moon shone leaves, I thought birds. You are angel, Willie, better twenty hundred angels." And Agnes threw her arms round his neck hugged kissed him. As soon he could speak, is, soon she ceased choking him, he said-- "You _were_ tree last night: wind fluttering leaves; moon shining them"-- "And carried shawl, red wings angel," cried Agnes, dancing delight. "Yes, pet, I daresay was. But are not sorry lose big angel?" "The angel dream, you are here, Willie. Besides, you will big angel day, Willie, you will wings, able fly about." "But you will wings then, able fly without me." "But I _may_ fold sometimes--may not I? would much nicer carried _your_ wings--sometimes, know. Look, look, Willie! Look sunbeam trunk fir--how red it is got. I wish I could peep sun. Where he be? I see I go his beam there--should not I?" "He is shining past end cottage," said Willie. "Go, you will see him." "Go where?" asked Agnes. "Into red sunbeam fir-tree." "I have not got wings yet, Willie." "That is people often say they are inclined try legs." "But I cannot go there, Willie." "You have not tried." "How I try?" "You are even trying try. You are standing talking, saying cannot." It nearly Agnes could keep crying. But she felt she must something lest Willie vexed. There seemed one way get nearer sunbeam, go tree run foot other. What Willie made stair also? But she turned see she go down, she carried blind, she caught sight straight staircase two boughs, and, shriek delight, she ran. "Gently, gently! Do not bring tree tremendous weight," cried Willie, following her close behind. At end stairs she sprang upon bough fir, moment sitting full light sunset. "O Willie! Willie! _is_ grand! How good, kind you! You _have_ made bird me! What papa mamma say? Will not delighted? I must run fetch Mona." So saying she hurried across again, stair, away look Mona Shepherd, shouting delight she ran. In minutes her cries gathered whole house bottom garden, well Mr Shepherd Mona Mrs Hunter. Mr Macmichael went tree, Mr Shepherd last misgivings; for, mechanical faculty himself, he could rightly value Willie's, feared he might made stair safe. But Mr Macmichael soon satisfied him, showing strong firm Willie made every part it. The next evening, Willie went his plan, make way Bird Agnes one tree another whole clump. It took many evenings, however, complete it, good many construct elm tree thin wooden house cunningly perched upon several strongest boughs branches. He called Bird Agnes's Nest. It doors windows, several stories it, upper stories rest lower, upon higher branches tree. To two he made stairs, rope-ladder third. When house finished, he put little table largest room, got light chairs house, asked his father mother grandmother tea Bird Agnes's Nest. But grannie declined go tree. She said _her_ climbing days long ago. CHAPTER XXII. WILLIE'S PLANS BUD. Either over, beginning; for, next winter, Willie college, grannie taken ill; although sent come home once, she climbed higher ere he arrived. When opened her will, found she left everything Willie. There hundred pounds ready money, property brought fifty pounds a-year--not much one would spent everything himself, good deal one loved people, sakes would contrive little go long way. So Willie henceforth able relieve his father paying his college expenses. He laid little too, his father wished him, he see best use it. His father always talked _using_ never _spending_ money. When he came home next summer, he moved his old room, Agnes slept little closet her mother's, much preferred larger solitary room herself. His mother especially glad roof night. But Willie felt something ought done room he left ruins, nothing ought allowed spoil uselessness. He not, however, see time he could turn it. I need hardly say he kept his old friendships. No day passed he home without his going see one his former companions--Mr Willett, Mr Spelman, Mr Wilson. For Hector, he went see oftenest all, he his favourite, sickly, therefore need attention. But he greatly improved his acquaintance William Webster; although he much occupy him, would satisfied he able drive shuttle, work treadles batten, and, short, turn almost good bit linen William himself--only he wanted twice much time it. One day, going see Hector, he found bed poorly. "My shoemaking nearly over, Mr Willie," he said. "But I do not mind much; I am sure find corner general business ready somewhere I am wanted more." "Have drinking water lately?" asked Willie. "No. I busy last week, had not time, rather cold go out. But matter wind blew door window dreadfully--and it is clay floor, firing dear--that I caught cold, cold worst thing me--that poor rickety body mine. And cold bad one." Here great fit coughing came on, accompanied symptoms Willie saw dangerous, he went home get medicine. On way back thought struck him, which, however, he would say nothing Hector he talked his father mother it, he evening supper. "I will tell what, Hector," he said, he went see next day--"you must come occupy room ruins. Since grannie went home I do not want it, it is pity lying idle. It is deal warmer this, I will get stove winter. You will not work hard you have got rent pay, much water like without trouble walking hill it. Then there is garden walk please--all level, little stair climb get back room." "But I trouble all, Mr Willie!" "You would trouble--we have two servants now. If like give little one shilling then, she will glad enough make bed, sweep room; know Tibby great regard you, glad cooking want--it is much, I know: porridge cup tea all. And there is father look health, Agnes amuse sometimes, mother look everything, and"-- Here poor Hector fairly broke down. When he recovered he said-- "But could gentle folks like bear see hump-backed creature like crawling place?" "They would enjoy enjoyed it," said Willie. It arranged. As soon Hector able moved, he carried Ruins, nursed everybody. Nothing could exceed his comfort his gratitude. He soon able work again, he evidently happier little towards general business, Mr Macmichael thought best him. One day, Willie work his laboratory, getting half-stifled sudden fume chlorine, opened door air Hector passed it. He stood door followed walk his eyes, watching he went--now disappearing behind blossoms apple-tree, climbing one little mounds, getting elm-tree, looking sides, his sickly face absolutely shining pleasure. "But," said Willie himself, "why Hector invalid pleasure?" He found answer question. I do not think he looked one hard though. And again, once, he said himself-- "What grannie's money given for?" That night he dream. The two questions doubt share giving him, perhaps also certain essay Lord Bacon--"Of Building," namely--which he reading he went bed. He dreamed that, pulled middle night his wheel, he went go garden. But moment he back door, he fancied something strange going his room ruins--he could tell what, he must go see. When he climbed stairs opened door, Hector Macallaster he ought be, asleep his bed. But _was_ something strange going on; stream, came dashing side wooden spout, flowing round Hector's bed, away he knew whither. Another strange thing was, wall door new him. He opened it, found another chamber, like his own; also lay one, he knew who, bed, stream water flowing around it. There also second door, beyond third room, third patient asleep, third stream flowing around bed, third door beyond. He went room room, on, hundred such, he thought, length came vaulted chamber, seemed well. From centre vault rose great chimney, chimney huge fire, fire stood mighty golden cauldron, which, large pipe, came water well, went pouring great rushing, hissing, bubbling. From side cauldron, water rushed away another pipe trough ran chambers, made rivers flowed beds sleeping patients. And wonderful all--by fire stood two angels, grand lovely wings, made great fanning wings, blew fire loud strong golden cauldron. And Willie looked faces, he saw one his father, Mr Shepherd. And he gave great cry delight, woke weeping. CHAPTER XXIII. WILLIE'S PLANS BLOSSOM. In morning, Willie's head full his dream. How gladly would he turned reality! That impossible--but might he something towards it? He long ago seen doomed realise ideal, take first step towards it. "Oh! little thing do, cannot use!" say. "And it is distance I mean, I give life have!" They think say would give life it, yet give single hearty effort. Hence stop are, rather go back back care bit thoughts used think great cherished glory thought them. But even wretched people set hearts making money, begin saving first penny can, next next. And reward: get riches want--with loss souls sure, think of. The people hand want noble good, begin taking first thing comes hand right, go one thing another, growing better better. In way, although would absurd Willie rack his brain scheme restore grand building Priory, he could yet bethink hundredth room come next first, neither third; one first second, he might something towards existence that. He went immediately breakfast, began peering ruins see second room might be. To his delight he saw that, little contrivance, could built side wall Hector's room. He plenty money it, his grannie's legacy yet touched. He thought himself, talked his father, consulted Spelman. The end was, without nearly spending his little store, he had, time came his return college, built another room. As garret full his grandmother's furniture, nothing easier fit up--and nicely too. It remained find occupant it. This would easy enough also without going far door, Willie his father practical men, therefore could content merely good: wanted much good could. It would therefore satisfy put new room person--say, Mrs Wilson, could get pretty well she was, though she might made comfortable. But suppose could find sickly mother large family, weeks change, fine air hills wonderful water Prior's well, would restore strength cheerfulness, much good would way--seeing help mother children help children well, mention husband friends family! There plenty found amongst patients he attend college. The expense living great Priory Leas, Mr MacMichael willing bear that, test influences water climate upon strangers. Although means best season experiment, yet thoroughly successful pale rheumatic mother six, Willie first sent home his father's care. She returned her children Christmas, comparatively hale woman, capable making everybody her twice happy before. Another nearly like her bodily condition circumstances he could find, took her place,--with like result; long healing hovered Priory Leas began known talked amongst professors college, medical men city. CHAPTER XXIV. WILLIE'S PLANS BEAR FRUIT. When his studies finished, Willie returned assist his father, he desire settle great city ambition becoming fashionable doctor getting large fees growing rich. He regarded end life being, large measure, take his share general business. By time reputation Prior's Well spread sides, country people begun visit Leas, stay week ten days drink water. Indeed many kept coming going hours garden, MacMichaels length found troublesome, small pipe laid little stone trough built garden wall outside, whoever would might come drink less trouble concerned. But Willie come home new idea his head. An old valetudinarian city, knew every spa Europe, wanted try Priory Leas consulted it. Finding accommodation he judged suitable, he seriously advised Willie build house fit persons position, he called them, assuring would soon make fortunes did. Now although, I said, ambition either father son, fortune never seemed either worth taking trouble about, yet suggested something better. "Why," said Willie his father, "should not restore bit Priory way man like Mr Yellowley could endure little while? He would pay us well, able cannot pay us." "We could not cook man like that," said his mother. "He would not want that," said his father. "He would sure bring his servants." The result Mr MacMichael thought thing worth trying, resolved lay his little savings, well Willie could add, getting kitchen convenient rooms constructed ruins--of course keeping much possible plan architectural character. He found, however, would want good deal could manage scrape together them, point giving scheme, least altering one would much longer making return, Mr Shepherd, become acquainted plans, consequently difficulties, offered join little he laid aside rainy day--which proved sufficient complete sum necessary. Between three thing effected, Mr Yellowley first visitor. I sorry say he grumbled good deal first proximity cobbler, meet his walks garden; point Mr MacMichael, course took old man's complaints good-humouredly, would budge, he reconcile he best might. Nor difficult he found he must. Before long became excellent friends, give time opportunity, ordinarily good man nature overcome end. Mr Yellowley heart good-natured, cobbler well worth knowing. Before former left, two often seen pacing garden together, talking happily. It quite unnecessary recount gradations growth room room arose ruins Priory. When Mr Yellowley went away, nearly six months' sojourn, latter part which, wonderfully he restored air water medical care Mr MacMichael, he enjoyed little shooting hills, he paid hundred fifty pounds accommodation medical attendance--no great sum, money goes now-a-days, good return six months outlay thousand pounds. This laid accumulate next addition. And Priory, taken growing, went it. They cleared away mound mound garden, turning solid walls, formed mainly excellent stones, waiting put again. The evil consequence garden became little less picturesque removal, although, hand, good deal productive. Yes, second apparently bad consequence--the Priory spread well grew, encroached little upon garden. But remedy soon appeared. The next house garden, although called Manse, clergyman parish lived there, Mr Shepherd's property. The ruins formed great part boundary two, plain see Priory extended good way garden. Indeed Mr Shepherd's house, well Mr MacMichael's, built ruins. Mr Shepherd offered wall thrown building extended his side well--so stand middle one large garden. My readers need put question would become two proprietors quarrelled; become less likely ever thing happen. Willie told Mona he loved her he could tell, wanted ask her question, he did not know how; Mona told Willie she would suppose his question he would suppose her answer; Willie said, "May I suppose answer I like?" Mona answered "Yes" quite decidedly; Willie given her kiss; Mona taken kiss given another it; understood, fear wall built gardens. So Priory grew flourished gained great reputation; fame two doctors, father son, spread far wide cures wrought. And many people came paid large sums. But rich people came, poor people invited. For never would allow making money intrude upon dignity high calling. How avarice cure go together? _A greedy healer men_! What marriage words! The Priory became quite grand building. The chapel grew again, windows stained glass shone like jewels; Mr Shepherd, preached parish church morning, always preached Priory chapel Sunday evening, patients, one besides pleased, went hear him. They built great baths, hot cold, kinds--from baths people could swim, baths showered sharp rain. It great admirable place. After two fathers died, Mona picture Willie's dream painted, portraits two angels. This story Gutta Percha Willie.
